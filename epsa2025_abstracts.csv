"abstract_0001_1163_0027.html","Autonomous or Automata: When Are Bureaucrats Responsive to Politicians? An Experimental Study of Local Civil Servants in Sweden and Spain","Which civil servants are more responsive to political demands, and under what conditions? Using experimental survey data from 4,000 civil servants across 15 sectors and 271 municipalities in Spain and Sweden, we examine their responses to two distinct demands: willingness to violate impartiality and willingness to innovate. Our results reveal two key findings. First, ideologically aligned civil servants are more likely to violate the impartiality principle when on temporary contracts, but are less likely to do so when on permanent contracts. Importantly, these effects are only observed in Spain, not in Sweden, highlighting the role of the institutional context on administrative behavior. Second, a civil servant’s Public Service Motivation (PSM) affects attitudes toward innovation differently depending on the institutional context, too. In Spain, high-PSM civil servants are less willing to accept politicians’ demands to innovate a failing public service, while in Sweden, we observe the exact opposite: high-PSM individuals are more likely to accept politicians’ pressures to innovate. These dynamics point to how similar individual characteristics may result in widely different, even opposing, responses to political demands depending on the institutional context, with significant consequences for both the quality of public services and democratic governance.","Keywords: Civil Servants, Public Service Motivation, Norms, Innovation, Impartiality","Ramin Shirali","Ramin Shirali","European University Institute","Victor Lapuente","University of Gothenburg","Kohei Suzuki","Leiden University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","University of Gothenburg","Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0002_0874_0095.html","The Candidate Factory: Technological Change and Political Supply","The transition from industrial to post-industrial societies is reshaping political landscapes, with studies documenting a decline in working-class representation. This paper provides a structural explanation for the changing composition of political elites, focusing on the role of technological advancements such as automation and robotization. I argue that the distributional effects of automation play a key role in shaping political representation. Specifically, I theorize that automation alters the distribution of economic resources and opportunities across occupations, influencing who runs for office. I propose that those most negatively affected by automation, particularly individuals from working-class or automatable backgrounds, are increasingly underrepresented among political candidates. This research examines how material changes impact political candidacy, using data on representatives to state legislatures in the US from 1997 to 2018, as well as the entire population of candidates for lower-level offices (such as city councils, school boards, and city supervisors) in California between 1995 and 2021. Candidates are classified by their occupational backgrounds, and these data are linked to district-level information, including measures of exposure to automation and robotization. The findings reveal that in areas with higher exposure to automation, there is a notable decline in candidates from occupations most affected by robotization. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural factors shaping the supply of political candidates and their implications for representation and policy outcomes.","Keywords: comparative politics, political economy, automation, representation, political inequality","Paolo Agnolin","Paolo Agnolin",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0003_0433_0185.html","Ideas Matter! Theory and Evidence on Political Ideology in India","Does political ideology matter in developing countries? If so, around which issues is it structured, why, and what can we learn from its study? We investigate these questions in India, where as in much of the Global South, scholars have traditionally explained politics as a contestation over material resources rather than ideas. We argue for more attention to the role of ideas in such contexts, and we theorize that ideological divides in India will be salient, structured around long-standing debates, and that the dominant Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will hold an outsized role in shaping the terms and focus of disagreement. We find support for our theory in two nationally representative surveys with embedded endorsement experiments, one conducted online (N=2,393) and another over the phone via random-digit dialing (N=1,255). Specifically, we observe that respondents can be placed along a single ideological dimension, that divides map onto historical debates over state interventionism, cultural pluralism, and minority accommodation, and that one's placement predicts a wide range of political behaviors and attitudes. We also find that feelings toward the BJP are particularly predictive of ideological placement and that endorsements from BJP politicians are more influential, especially for cultural issues. Our findings indicate that ideology is consequential for Indian politics and may differ in important ways from the West, and call for greater attention to the study of ideology in developing country contexts.","Keywords: Political Ideology, India, Experiment, Endorsement, Global South","Nicholas Haas","Nicholas Haas","Aarhus University","Rajeshwari Majumdar","Yale University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0004_1103_0122.html","Who counts? Loyalty and bureaucratic careers in autocracies","Autocrats rely on the public bureaucracy not only to govern, but also to minimize threats to their rule. The need to delegate to the bureaucracy creates the possibility that bureaucrats might defect instead of staying loyal to the regime. This paper examines the role of microlevel factors in conditioning loyalty in autocracies by developing an argument that loyalty depends on the bureaucrats’ career dependency on the regime. I thereafter test various implications of the argument by using novel data from a recent case of uncompetitive authoritarian elections. To that end, I collect and utilize a dataset with a measure of loyalty that is constructed by comparing official results with results reported by voters and with a measure of career dependency based on data on more than 2000 members of electoral commissions. Corroborating the argument, stronger career dependency corresponds with higher propensity of bureaucrats to stay loyal to the regime.","Keywords: autocratic politics, bureaucracy, electoral fraud","Palina Kolvani","Palina Kolvani",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0005_0150_0221.html","Bureaucratic Constraints on Embedded Liberalism: Evidence from the Trade Adjustment Assistance","Scholars have long claimed that international integration can be sustained by providing sufficient government compensation to workers adversely affected by it. We argue that the success of this social contract—known as Embedded Liberalism—also depends on the bureaucracies responsible for delivering the compensation. Bureaucratic delays in delivering compensation can undermine citizens' confidence in the government's ability to protect them from the adverse consequences of international trade, leading to diminished support for internationalism. We test our theory on the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program in the United States. By leveraging the quasi-random assignment of TAA petitions to individual bureaucrats, we estimate the effect of bureaucrat-driven delays in processing petitions on the attitudes of over 200,000 voters from 2006 to 2016. Empirical results support our theory and additionally indicate that effects are more pronounced among labor unions and in districts with more numbers of TAA-affected workers. We discuss how bureaucratic hurdles in redistributive programs may significantly contribute to the backlash against globalization.","Keywords: embedded liberalism, bureaucrats, anti-globalization backlash, redistribution","Kyuwon Lee","Kyuwon Lee","University of Southern California","Carlos Felipe Balcazar","University College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0006_0701_0291.html","Not Every Cloud has a Silver Lining: Climate-Related Natural Hazards and Campaign Contributions in Colombia (PECEGS)","In contexts of local state capture, can negative economic shocks reduce elite influence in politics? We focus on the impact of natural hazards, which have been shown to have significant negative economic effects and which, therefore, might be capable of limiting local state capture. Where natural hazards undermine the economic interests of local elites, this may reduce the resources that elites can commit to campaign contributions through which they exert political influence. Alternatively, campaign income might increase in response to natural hazards if local elite capture extends to increases in government transfers that follow the occurrence of hazards. We explore these expectations using a difference-in-difference design in Colombia, where climate- and weather-related natural hazards such as flooding and landslides are increasingly frequent and widespread. Our results show that natural hazards significantly increase campaign contributions for mayoral candidates in municipal elections. Moreover, this increase is driven by personal contributions from candidates and their direct relatives. Further analysis suggests two possible and compatible explanations for this: an increase in economic capacity through the capture of transfers and an increase in incentives due to discretionary spending powers.","Keywords: Climate Change, Natural Hazards, Campaign Finance, State Capture","Robin Harding","Robin Harding","University of Oxford","Nelson Ruiz","University of Essex","Laura Guerrero Sánchez","Universidad del Rosario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","University of Essex","Universidad del Rosario",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0007_0840_0325.html","Dangerous Links? Cross-border Ethnic Kin and Forced Displacement from a Geospatial Perspective","The use of force to permanently displace ethnic groups and claim their land, a form of “ethnic cleansing”, is a recurring phenomenon with grave humanitarian costs. Examples around the globe show that perpetrators frequently displace members of ethnic groups who have kin communities in neighbouring states. However, existing literature on causes of ethnic forced displacement focuses on domestic factors, while determinants across borders are not well understood. This article addresses this gap and investigates how cross-border links of ethnic groups affect their risk of being permanently displaced with force. I argue that politically excluded ethnic groups with cross-border links can be perceived by governments as both political and territorial threats. This is because such groups may use support from kin communities to organise rebellion (political threat) and make demands for secession (territorial threat). Governments likely seek to remove this “double threat”, which increases the risk of forced displacement in areas of excluded ethnic groups with cross-border links compared to areas where groups have no such links. This risk is exacerbated if kin communities gain political and economic power in neighbouring states. To test this argument, I use a novel dataset with geo-located events of ethnic forced displacement in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (1990-2021). Evidence from staggered difference-in-differences models shows that ethnic groups with powerful cross-border kin are indeed more likely to be forcibly displaced than groups without such links. These findings imply that policies to mitigate forced displacement along ethnic lines need to take cross-border dynamics into account.","Keywords: Ethnic Cleansing, Permanent Forced Displacement, Transborder Ethnic Kin, Violence against Civilians, Geo-located Data","Jana Regina Kissling","Jana Regina Kissling",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0008_0313_0927.html","Digital Defenses Against Naming and Shaming: Measuring Support for Repressive Regimes in Online Interactions with Uyghur Exiles","How do authoritarian regimes and their supporters use social media to suppress regime threats during periods of international scrutiny? We argue that, when heightened global attention constrains more overt forms of repression, pro-regime actors inundate prominent dissidents with hostile social media engagement to covertly suppress threats to the state's international reputation. In particular, prominent exiled dissidents are likely targets of this behavior because they are uniquely positioned to mobilize international pressure. We test this argument using a corpus of social media interactions with prominent Uyghur activists-in-exile between 2017 and 2022—a period of increased international attention on the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). With these data, we assess temporal shifts in alignment with the strategic interests of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in two ways. First, we test whether cross-document cosine similarities—our measure of content coordination—increase following the U.S. State Department's pivotal declaration of genocide in January 2021. Second, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify temporal shifts in content that deflects widespread criticism of the PRC during this period. Our findings have important implications for understanding digital authoritarianism and the role of social media in transnational repression.","Keywords: state repression, global authoritarianism, social media","Allison Koh","Allison Koh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0009_0767_0397.html","Sovereignty Threat and Indigenous Identity","In many countries with history of colonization and occupation, Indigenous groups continue to suffer from non-representation, discrimination and injustice. A key solution for these groups to remain salient and relevant in public discourse may be at the grassroots level, where individual citizens, rather than the government, can take an active part in showing support for the Indigenous rights. In this paper we explore how difficult it could be to achieve this goal. We conduct a novel survey experiment in Taiwan, where the government has increasingly recognized Indigenous rights and promoted their culture. Our results show that informing citizens of Taiwan's generally positive stance towards multiculturalism and continuing plight of discriminated Indigenous population does help to increase the respondents' grassroots support for the Indigenous. We also find, however, that their support level remains tenuous and sensitive to events that promote solidarity among the citizens. In particular we look at the sovereignty threat coming from mainland China and find that when respondents are reminded of impending crisis, solidarity concerns appear to overshadow values of cultural diversity and Indigenous rights. Furthermore there is little evidence that respondents incorporate Taiwan's Indigenous culture as their own, even though doing so could potentially help to shape an identity that is distinct and unique from the Chinese counterpart.","Keywords: Sovereignty, indigenous identity, Taiwan, China, survey experiment","Tiffany Ting-Yu Lee","Christopher Paik","Division of Social Science, New York University Abu Dhabi","Tiffany Ting-Yu Lee","Institute of Political Science, Academia Sinica","Greg Sheen","Institute of Political Science, Academia Sinica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Division of Social Science, New York University Abu Dhabi","Institute of Political Science, Academia Sinica",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, while debriefing is generally effective in addressing deception, it may also lead to unintended consequences, such as increased skepticism and reduced trust in science. We propose that, by explicitly revealing the use of deception, debriefing may inadvertently lower participants' trust in scientists and decrease their willingness to participate in future studies. In this study, we will conduct various rounds of experiments to compare the effects of standard, enhanced, and no-debriefing conditions on trust in research and other relevant institutions as well as participant retention in multi-wave studies. This research aims to underscore both the positive corrective role of debriefing and its negative potential to increase skepticism and undermine trust, highlighting the need for tailored approaches that uphold ethical standards while preserving participant trust and engagement in academic research.","Keywords: experiments, debriefing, deception, trust, engagement","Emma Hoes","Emma Hoes","University of Zurich"," Sacha Altay","University of Zurich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This kind of ""meta-reasoning"" about the electorate can influence individual voters' choices in ways that advantage some candidates over others. We use a formal model to demonstrate how the presence of prejudiced voters in an electorate can induce non-prejudiced voters to under-invest in information about relatively unknown and novel candidates.

We examine variation in electoral systems in the United States, specifically the presence of two-round runoff elections used in some states but not others.  We find that top-two runoff elections cause greater ideological diversity in political parties in legislatures in U.S. states.  We argue this is because same-party competition can occur in both the first and second rounds of the elections.  In these runoff states, in contrast to those with closed primary rules, party caucuses will have greater ideological diversity as some candidates will face primary reelection incentives to move to the extreme. We test this using a synthetic control model, comparing multiple US state legislatures with different electoral system rules. We find causal evidence that the top-two runoff primary electoral system has increased ideological diversity in both the majority and minority party caucuses in legislative chambers. This effect persists for Democratic party caucuses after adoption of this new electoral system, but this effect for Republican party caucuses is only for a few time periods before it reverts back to pre-treatment lower ideological heterogeneity. Implications for the role electoral systems play in creating instability via heterogeneity in legislative parties are discussed.","Keywords: electoral systems, legislatures, legislative ideology, party heterogeneity in legislatures, causal inference in legislatures","Jose Alcocer, Christian Grose","Jose Alcocer","University of Southern California","Christian Grose","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0013_1186_0936.html","Bayesian Rank Likelihood to Address Measurement Error Bias from Ordered Categorical Predictors","Researchers often seek to estimate the effect of a continuous predictor Z on an outcome Y, but Z is frequently observed indirectly through ordered categorical indicators Z*, such as credit ratings for government default risk or binned income categories in surveys. To approximate the underlying continuous variable Z, researchers often use score imputation methods, which introduce or exacerbate measurement error bias.This project evaluates three methods for predicting Z from observed ordered categories Z* in income survey data: the widely used Hout’s middle-point score imputation, ordinal probit, and Bayesian rank likelihood. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I assess their performance in terms of bias and efficiency. The results show that Bayesian rank likelihood achieves the lowest prediction error, outperforming the other methods. Moreover, when estimating the marginal effect of Z on Y, Hout's imputed scores produce biased and inconsistent estimates, while Bayesian rank likelihood provides unbiased and efficient ones. This study warns public opinion researchers to avoid Hout's income score measure and instead use categorical variables directly as provided in the survey or apply Bayesian rank likelihood, which offers more efficient estimates with the lowest measurement error. The robustness of these results is tested under non-normality of Z and model misspecification. The implications are generalizable to any regression setting that uses as independent variable ordered categorical predictors as proxies for an underlying latent continuous distribution.","Keywords: measurement error bias, latent regression methods, Bayesian inference, survey data, semiparametric inference.","Ramses Llobet Bentarif","Ramses Llobet Bentarif",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Washington",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I establish causality by leveraging a legislative reform in Brazil setting the maximum number of local legislators based on population thresholds. Combining data on elected city councilors, 200,000 campaign donors, and administrative labor market registries, I document four empirical findings. First, an increase in the legislature size leads to a 29 percent increase in the likelihood of landing a civil service job for political supporters. Second, appointments concentrate on top managerial roles, hinting at discretionary allotments influencing policy-making. Third, civil servants already part of the local administration are more likely to be reassigned to top-tier management roles. Fourth, these discretionary nominations lead to the selection of less-skilled individuals.","Keywords: Legislature Size; Distributive Politics; Public Sector Employment","Caique Melo","Caique Melo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, citizens’ increasing levels of antipathy and negative sentiments towards supporters of opposing parties, a phenomenon coined as affective polarization, has been on the rise around the globe as well. Could affective polarization be a causal factor for democratic erosion? While there are several theoretical conjectures in this direction, evidence on affective polarization’s detrimental consequences for democratic governance has been rather mixed. In this paper we draw on a candidate choice conjoint experiment embedded into a nationally representative survey fielded in Turkey. We find that exogenous decreases in individuals’ affective polarization levels lead them to punish political candidates who violate democratic norms more than respondents in the control group. Our research suggests that affective polarization might play a causal role in democratic backsliding by making partisans less likely to punish politicians who violate democratic norms.","Keywords: affective polarization, democratic erosion, democratic attitudes","Büşra Söylemez-Karakoç","Selim Erdem Aytaç","Koç University"," Büşra Söylemez-Karakoç","Koç University"," Seda Çalışır","Koç University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Koç University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0017_0793_0990.html","Room for snowflakes in politics? How  future candidates’ perceptions of harassment in politics and attitude shifts differ from ordinary citizens’","A key challenge in survey research on harassment, intimidation, and violence directed at political officeholders and candidates is to account for variation in the acts that different sociopolitical groups perceive as harassment. When perceptions of harassment vary significantly, including how serious or common harmful acts are perceived to be, it is hard to gauge the prevalence of negative experiences in politics or understand the democratic implications. This study maps citizens’ evaluations of real harassment stories from Danish politicians and investigates the stories’ effect on citizens’ willingness to participate in politics (e.g., to run for office) and their conceptions of politics, satisfaction with democracy, and gender equality attitudes. We use an original survey experiment from Denmark with 4,000 nationally representative participants, who are asked to evaluate five harassment stories, selected at random from 100 stories. If knowledge or norms about harassment in politics are lacking, providing episodic information should reduce the willingness to participate in politics. Special attention is paid to key personality traits, age, gender, ideology, and likely future candidacy. If likely future candidates have higher thresholds for viewing incidents as harassment or reacting negatively to harassment stories, it implies that a ‘toughening’ self-selection process only allows the thick-skinned to survive in politics, which has important implications for descriptive and substantive representation.","Keywords: Survey experiment, gender and politics, recruitment, representation, comparative politics","Søren Damsbo-Svendsen","Søren Damsbo-Svendsen","Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen"," Karina Kosiara-Pedersen","Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite increasing diversity within the population, almost all of these female leaders are ethnically Danish. This underrepresentation of minorities poses challenges for Danish society, indicating that a growing segment of citizens are not represented adequately in the policy making process. Since public sector positions often require specialized education, it is crucial to increase the enrollment of minority students in university programs that lead to careers in public administration. Building on prior research highlighting successful strategies for minority recruitment (Linos et al., 2017) and theories emphasizing the role of shared identity, we design a field experiment to examine whether professionally produced role model videos can influence female minority high school students' interest in and application rates to a prestigious social science program that supply heavily to public management. The study involves nine professionally shot and scripted videos, featuring six minority women and three native Danish women, shown to 2,000 female high school students with a non-Western immigrant background. Using a between-subjects design with stimuli-sampled groups (majority vs. minority role models), the experiment unfolds in three phases: an initial survey incorporating the intervention and immediate outcomes, a follow-up survey, and finally, linkage of responses to Danish register data. This design enables us to assess how the intervention impacts educational choices in the years following the study and to assess to what extent role models can aid in diversifying the bureaucracy of tomorrow.","Keywords: field experiment, role models, bureaucracy, diversity, intersectionalism, women, ethnicity, experiments, public administration, public management","Josephine Arnfred","Josephine Arnfred","University of Copenhagen"," Asmus Leth Olsen","University of Copenhagen"," Merlin Schaeffer","University of Copenhagen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effect of government justification strategies on the legitimacy of compliance with EU policies.","No polity, be it national or supranational, can prevail if its community contests the legitimacy of its policies. Unlike conflicts over European integration, compliance with individual EU policies rarely reaches a high media profile, which has enabled domestic actors to implement policies away from the public eye. However, the politicization of the EU has fundamentally changed the politics of compliance, increasing public awareness about the impact of EU law on domestic policy. In such politicized settings, national governments could engage in different strategies to exonerate themselves from culpability when implementing contested supranational policies. Thus, justification strategies are an important source of responsiveness for domestic actors. In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of different justifications for compliance with supranational policies on the perceived legitimacy of implementation. Whereas a common strategy is to shift the blame to the EU, citizens may perceive this as less legitimate if the responsibility of implementation lies in domestic institutions. Based on a survey experiment, we assess whether defending compliance with supranational policies increases the perceived legitimacy of implementation relative to blame-shifting or being silent about compliance. Our findings have implications for democratic accountability of domestic actors and the future of EU policymaking.","Keywords: justification strategies, compliance, European Union, public policy","Asya Zhelyazkova","Asya Zhelyazkova","Erasmus University Rotterdam","Thijs Lindner","Erasmus University Rotterdam","Tim Heinkelmann-Wild","Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich","Agnieszka Kanas","Erasmus University Rotterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","Erasmus University Rotterdam","Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite theoretical predictions about populism’s role in promoting emotional extremity, polarization, and democratic erosion, empirical evidence linking specific rhetorical elements to these outcomes is limited. This paper will advance our understanding through a novel AI-assisted vignette experiment that systematically disentangles the impact of populist rhetoric’s constituent elements. By independently manipulating the presence of anti-elitist and people-centric rhetoric while controlling for other message characteristics, we will assess whether populism’s documented effects stem primarily from anti-elitism, people-centrism, or their interaction. The study will also examine key moderating factors that may condition these effects, including political sophistication and personality. This research will contribute to both theoretical discussions about populism’s nature and empirical understanding of its effects, while demonstrating the utility of AI-assisted experimental methods in political communication research for generating controlled variations in rhetorical frames.","Keywords: populist rhetoric, anti-elitism, people-centrism, democratic erosion, polarization","Margit Tavits, Jacob Montgomery, Christopher Lucas","Margit Tavits","Washington University in St. Louis"," Jacob Montgomery","Washington University in St. Louis"," Christopher Lucas","Washington University in St. Louis","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Washington University in St. Louis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0022_1237_0788.html","How mainstream political parties respond to the rise of anti-climate discourses.","How do political parties respond to the politicization of adversarial positions on previously consensual issues? While existing literature extensively examines how mainstream political parties react to the introduction of new issues by challengers, such as the Greens or the radical right, there is less evidence on how mainstream parties behave when another party opposes an issue they initially supported. This paper investigates how mainstream parties respond to the rise of anti-climate discourse promoted by radical right parties. Existing research shows that climate change was traditionally characterized by valence competition, where mainstream parties largely responded positively to green issues and maintained consensus. However, party competition on climate change is evolving as radical right parties politicize anti-climate discourse, raising questions about how this shift affects mainstream party behavior.To address these questions, I introduce new measurements of political party stances on green issues using natural language processing methods applied to a large corpus of party communications on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). The dataset includes 150 parties across 14 Western European countries from 2010 to 2023. Using this data, I descriptively examine the extent to which party competition on climate change has shifted from a valence to a positional dynamic—an area where systematic empirical evidence remains limited. Finally, I employ panel data at the weekly level to analyze how the radical right's politicization of climate change influences mainstream parties' behavior, while controlling for key drivers of political attention to climate change.","Keywords: climate politics, party competition, radical right, social media, polarisation","Malo Jan","Malo Jan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Center of European Studies and Comparative Politics, SciencesPo Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0023_0648_0791.html","Pragmatic compromise or pledge non-fulfillment","Compromise is an essential part of the democratic process. Moreover, for parliamentary politics to function in multiparty systems, compromise between parties is necessary for policy formulation and coalition formation. If citizens are unwilling to accept that their representatives, they risk not being governed at all. Recent results suggest that democratic citizens are overwhelmingly positive towards compromise – at least in the abstract (Wolak 2020, Green-Pedersen and Hjermitslev 2023). However, others have found that voters are skeptical of the compromise that their own party support, especially on specific issues that are particularly salient to them (Fortunato 2021, Plescia, Ecker, and Meyer 2022). This experiment tries to bridge the gap between these two opposite conclusions by exploring the effects of three contextual factors[1]: (1) Are compromises interpreted through partisan lenses? (2) What is the role of setting realistic expectations (i.e. is compromise evaluate pro- or retrospectively)? (3) Are citizens positive towards the abstract idea of compromise and negative towards concrete pledge non-fulfillment? The experiment was implemented shortly before the 2025 federal election in Germany.","Keywords: Pledge fulfillment, Party cooperation, Survey experiment","Ida Hjermitslev","Ida Hjermitslev","Aalborg University","Christofer Green-Pedersen","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aalborg University","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0024_0620_0859.html","Anticipating the Cost of Withdrawal: How the US Presidential Election Affects European Willingness to Spend and Defend","How do individuals react to fluctuations in the reliability of mutual defence within NATO? The toss-up election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for President of the United States featured two candidates with diametrically-opposed stances towards NATO. On the campaign trail, Trump insinuated that he would encourage Russian attacks on NATO allies, provided the targeted states do not meet their NATO spending commitments. For her part, Harris promised a business-as-usual approach to NATO and Article 5 commitments. The uncertainty of the outcome just one week before election day presented a rare opportunity to compare the effects of hegemonic withdrawal and its counterfactual on public attitudes towards defence. Using a survey experiment in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany, we explore how the threat of hegemonic withdrawal influences public willingness in NATO countries to, on the one hand, increase defence spending, and on the other, come to an ally's defence in the event of an attack. Respondents were randomly exposed to a vignette predicting either a Trump or Harris victory, alongside the respective candidate's policy positions towards the alliance. We then exposed respondents to a second vignette in which a NATO member is under attack, this time priming either in-group or out-group sentiment between the respondent's country and the allied country in need. Despite the universal promise of mutual defence under Article 5, we hypothesize that fissures in alliance cohesion will appear when solidarity must be extended to an ally that deviates from alliance norms.","Keywords: Defence spending, NATO, public opinion, survey experiment, international security","Hannah Jakob Barrett, Eric Gabo Ekeberg Nilsen","Hannah Jakob Barrett","Aarhus University","Eric Gabo Ekeberg Nilsen","University of Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0025_2026_1217.html","The Hidden Electorate: Commuters and the Political Economy of Local Governance","Although local economic output is widely assumed to be a valence good for both residents and local politicians, such assumptions fail when local labor demand outstrips the resident workforce, drawing commuters from surrounding municipalities and effectively  creating a non-voting “daytime” and a voting “nighttime” electorate. Existing scholarship highlights the importance of economic growth for local politics but overlooks how non-resident labor forces distort local accountability and representation. This study addresses this gap by examining how the influx of in-commuters—workers who cannot vote in local elections—reshapes political incentives, participation, and public goods provision. Using an original harmonized dataset of all German municipal elections between 1990 and 2020, combined with time-varying municipality-level data on in- and out-commuters, I link commuting flows to changes in voter turnout, incumbency turnover, social capital, and public service allocation. Preliminary results show that higher net commuting inflows correspond to lower electoral turnout, more frequent incumbent replacement, weakened civil society networks, and a shift in local policy priorities away from strictly economic goods. These findings illuminate how mobility-induced decoupling of residence and workplace challenges traditional models of local political accountability, offering new insight into how spatially fragmented labor markets reshape the political economy of governance in an era of increasing geographic mobility.","Keywords: Commuting, Local Governance, Political Accountability, Geographic Mobility, Political Economy","Florian Sichart","Florian Sichart",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The framework synthesizes three competing explanations for differing views on police performance: ascribed characteristics (e.g., race, gender), psychological mindset (e.g., attitudes toward authority, trust in government), and personal experiences (e.g., encounters with law enforcement). In this study, the applicability of this framework is tested in the context of U.S. immigration policy, a topic often debated with polarized views. The original framework suggested that individuals in lower subjective social positions tend to favor less restrictive policies and greater inclusivity. If this pattern holds, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that individuals with lower subjective social positions will support more lenient immigration policies compared to those with higher subjective social positions.The study uses data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to assess these attitudes and the extent to which subjective social position predicts individuals’ stances on immigration policy. This approach builds on the assumption that subjective social position, as previously shown in the context of policing, will similarly influence political preferences and policy evaluations in the realm of immigration.","Keywords: public opinion, immigration, subjective social framework","Regina Branton","Regina Branton",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of North Carolina Charlotte",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines the role of moral elites—individuals deemed influential across sectors—in the case of early introduction of state pensions. Unlike existing studies that focus narrowly on political or bureaucratic elites, we adopt a broader perspective by analyzing the diverse social positioning and resources of all actors identified as influential in this transformative process.Using a comparative approach, we investigate whether the structure of moral elites—particularly their resources (economic, cultural, social, and symbolic)—shaped pension reforms in similar ways across the UK and Denmark, two long-lived Western democracies. Drawing on extensive biographical and career data, we combine multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and social network analysis (SNA) to map the positions, relations, connections and sectorial ties of these elites.Our findings reveal that academics and civil society actors, often overlooked in contemporary studies, played pivotal roles alongside political and bureaucratic figures. Furthermore, we demonstrate how transnational ties between elites in the UK and Denmark facilitated the exchange of ideas and strategies, underscoring the global dimensions of welfare state development at the start of the 20th century.By combining prosopographical methods with quantitative mapping techniques, this study offers a novel perspective on the emergence of welfare states, highlighting the interplay of resources, networks, and transnational connections that enabled these policy innovations.","Keywords: moral elites, state pensions, welfare state development, civil society, comparative analysis","Milka Ivanovska Hadjievska","Milka Ivanovska Hadjievska","Copenhagen Business School"," Anders Sevelsted","Copenhagen Business School"," Morten Fischer Sivertsen","Copenhagen Business School","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Copenhagen Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, these explanations frequently fail to extend beyond advanced democracies, where most structural changes differ. To advance the limited understanding of the political effects of structural transformations in countries of the Global South, we study the shift to high-intensity agricultural production in Brazil in the early 2000s. We argue that -- similar to developments in advanced democracies -- left majoritarian parties (in this case the Brazilian Workers' Party, PT) losing the support of those left behind by structural change contributed significantly to Jair Bolsonaro's rise to power. At the same time, Bolsonaro's economically liberal appeals resonated with workers embedded in increasingly industrialized, export-oriented agriculture. Therefore, Bolsonaro garnered support from the winners and losers of structural transformation simultaneously. This highlights the role of economic liberalist appeals distinct to the radical right in the Global South.","Keywords: Far-right, radical right, structural transformation, technological change, Brazil","Philipp Kerler","Philipp Kerler","University of Zürich","David Doyle","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zürich","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contrary to a typically assumed ‘non-informative’ perspective, we propose that authoritarian communication can be ‘informative’ in the sense that autocrats change spending based on what they emphasize in their rhetoric. Leaders stay on message by diverting spending to areas they pay attention to in speech for purposes of cooptation and building a reputation for competence. Drawing on a corpus of presidential addresses of all post-Soviet autocrats 1991–2023, supplemented with analyses of Russian regions and a global sample of autocratic speakers in the UN, and semi-supervised keyword-assisted topic analysis, we find that autocratic issue attention to social and security matters is indeed followed by higher social and military spending.

Answering this question provides a novel way to examine the link between trade and labour standards. This paper develops hypotheses about worker perceptions, drawing on contrasting mechanisms underpinning theories of ‘trading up,’ which emphasize either the role of private regulation or economic upgrading. It tests these hypotheses using a survey experiment conducted on a sample of 2,500 garment workers in Morocco. In the absence of institutions that monitor labour compliance, workers expected no difference in working conditions between factories that export to high-standards markets and domestically oriented producers. The presence of private monitoring institutions caused expectations of working conditions in export factories to improve, making them comparable to factories monitored by government regulators. These results contribute to our understanding of how global trade shapes worker welfare by highlighting the role of firm-specific institutions and how workers perceive jobs in firms linked in different ways to global markets.","Keywords: trade, labor standards, GVCs, human rights, private governance","Alessandro Guasti","Alessandro Guasti",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Esade Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0031_0709_0293.html","Is Jesus Green? The Expansion of Evangelical Christianity and the Appeal of Pro-Climate Candidacies in Brazil  (PECEGS)","Conventional wisdom suggests that Christian evangelicals tend to prioritize social and moral issues over environmental concerns, which can limit their support for green candidates. Drawing on cross-country survey data indicating that Christian evangelicals are as likely as other citizens to recognize climate change as a real threat, we argue that the growth of evangelical Christianity in the Global South may create a bias in favor of pro-climate candidates. In contexts characterized by vulnerability and low state capacity, evangelical churches often function as substitutes for the state by absorbing the costs of climate change and providing support for low-income voters affected by climate-related events. Consequently, Christian evangelicals will likely combine their views on moral issues with a strategic, pragmatic, pro-climate orientation in elections, thus increasing the appeal of pro-climate candidacies. We test these claims with an exogenous expansion of evangelical churches driven by an as-if-random implementation of a large-scale electrification scheme across Brazilian states. Estimates from a difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design reveal that this discontinuous growth of evangelical Christianity causes more candidates to run in elections with pro-climate parties. Crucially, being associated with a pro-climate party enhances candidates' chances of securing a position in the local council (Câmara dos Vereadores). These findings illuminate the discussion on the challenges faced by Green parties in broadening their electoral base across emerging democracies. Evidence from Brazil suggests that the expansion of evangelical Christianity does not seem to be the main factor preventing Green parties from succeeding in the Global South.","Keywords: Christian evangelicals; climate change; green parties; pro-climate candidates; Brazil","Victor Araújo Silva","Victor Araújo Silva",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Reading",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We then investigate whether differences in coverage across outlets are primarily supply- or demand-driven. To identify supply and demand factors, we exploit common ownership of news outlets, geographic variation in audiences, and exogenous changes in reliance on news wire services. Finally, we connect media coverage to public opinion toward the conflict using an original survey experiment.

"abstract_0033_1011_0928.html","Trade Talk: The Changing Nature of Global Trade Narratives","How do political elites frame trade policy? This paper identifies three dominant trade narratives in elite discourse. The first is economic, emphasizing trade's impact on growth or employment. The second is sustainable development-based, highlighting trade’s influence on human rights, food security, and climate change.  The third is geopolitical, linking trade policy to national security concerns, including territorial integrity, political sovereignty, and a country's standing in the international system.We argue that the relative importance of these narratives varies across countries and over time depending on the challenges that a country predominantly confronts. When a country faces an economic challenge, such as low growth or high unemployment, the government likely focuses on the economic narrative. When the country faces a geopolitical challenge, the geopolitical narrative will dominate. Finally, the sustainable development narrative will be relatively the most important if the country neither faces an economic nor a geopolitical challenge. To test this argument, we analyze a novel text corpus comprising statements and press releases from heads of government, foreign ministries, and trade ministries in 26 countries (2010-2024).  We leverage few-shot classification and contextual word embeddings to analyze the text corpus.This paper makes three key contributions. First, it presents an original text corpus of political elites worldwide. Second, it demonstrates the growing centrality of national security concerns in trade policy narratives. Third, it calls on scholars of international politics to incorporate narrative analysis into the study of trade policy, moving beyond the current focus on trade measures.","Keywords: Geopolitics, International Trade, Large Language Models, Text-as-Data, Political Discourse","Andreas Dür, Gemma Mateo, Mehmet Yavuz","Andreas Dür","University of Salzburg"," Gemma Mateo","University of Salzburg"," Mehmet Yavuz","University of Salzburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Salzburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that these assumptions fail to adequately consider what we call ambiguity politics, a form of governance in which vagueness and lack of clarity may be useful and even functionally necessary for state-building elites and bureaucrats. Building on both existing literature and our observations in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, we propose a typology that maps the nature of ambiguity politics according to the level of analysis (micro/macro) at which political actors use or encounter ambiguity and the motivation that drives this ambiguity (strategic/accidental). We show that the logics underlying ambiguity politics are particularly pronounced in conflict and post-conflict settings, where power relations and domains of jurisdiction are being vigorously negotiated and contested. The early days of the post-2021 Taliban regime therefore provide us with a unique opportunity to observe processes and behaviors that usually remain invisible and shed light on bureaucratic politics more broadly. Yet, we show that these logics exist and persist in most institutional contexts. Hence, our typology explains seemingly irrational or incoherent administrative practices and decisions in a large variety of settings and provides the basis for more systematic comparative analyses of ambiguity politics.","Keywords: Ambiguity, Afghanistan, Post-Conflict, Politics","Jasmine Bhatia, Florian Weigand, Romain Malejacq","Jasmine Bhatia","Birkbeck, University of London","Florian Weigand","London School of Economics","Romain Malejacq","Radboud University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Birkbeck, University of London","London School of Economics","Radboud University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the model parties strategically choose: (1) their spatial policy position, (2) their division of scarce effort between the promotion of this spatial position and clientelist targeting, and (3) the set of voters who are targeted to receive clientelist benefits. In the baseline model the presence of clientelist appeals leads either to Downsian convergence or to an infinite cycle. The results are more nuanced when adding: a.) the possibility of abstention, and b.) reasonable restrictions to the subset of voters which parties can target with clientelist goods. With these additional elements, I find that the relationship between clientelism and ideological polarization should be curvilinear: ideological moderation should accompany equilibria with both very high and very low levels of clientelist effort, while ideological polarization should characterize equilibria at intermediate levels of clientelist effort. I also find that clientelist goods will be targeted diffusely to broad constituencies when spatial platforms are moderate; but will be narrowly targeted to pivotal (centrist) voters when spatial platforms polarize.","Keywords: Spatial Theory, Clientelism, Polarization, Distributive Politics","Daniel Kselman","Daniel Kselman",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"IE University, Department of Political Science and International Relations",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The promises and constraints of descriptive representation","The model of descriptive representation, where representative assemblies mirror the social composition of electorates, is a salient issue in contemporary debates about the quality of representative government. In this vein, proponents stress its potentials to reconnect citizens and the state and to effectively enhance political trust in contemporary democracies. This paper contributes to this debate in theoretical and empirical ways. Theoretically, it argues that descriptive representation may facilitate political trust but that this is conditioned by voter characteristics and the behavior of representatives. Specifically, we argue that voters react to descriptive representation contingent upon their group identities and the level of substantive representation that descriptive representatives provide. Empirically, we explore this argument on the basis of an original conjoint experiment fielded in Germany, the UK and Switzerland. In this experiment, we randomize both the descriptive traits and policy positions of fictitious legislators to explore their direct effects on political trust and also how they interact in this regard. We combine our experimental set-up with a survey component to draw inferences about how voter characteristics condition the elite level effects on political trust.

It accommodates all data types, all forms of covariates, any mapping between ideal points and observed decisions, and any Bayesian prior on the distribution of ideal points. It shows its true potential when combined with state-of-the-art embeddings to estimate ideal points on massive multilingual and multimodal datasets.

A multitude of empirical research shows that despite the existence of ballot secrecy laws, “money for votes” or distribution of electoral handouts is a strategy utilised in many developing polities despite the lack of contract enforcement. In order to reconcile this fact with the “commitment problem” of the contingent exchange implied in electoral clientelism, I show that pre-election transfers may be a signaling mechanism to indicate candidate strength in order to capture the vote, and that “vote” buying is a weakly dominant strategy for candidates. I use a formal model to show that vote monitoring may be a less effective electoral strategy for candidates in environments where perceived electoral viability is more important than ideological differences.","Keywords: Electoral handouts, clientelism, vote buying, voter reciprocity","Ameetosri Basu","Ameetosri Basu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Why do voters supporting different political parties differ in their support for government action to address climate risks? Do they differ in their perceptions of the likelihood of different types of risk? In their perceptions of the severity of these risks? Or in their views about the effectiveness and appropriateness of government action? How do these perceptions vary when considering damage domestically compared to damage in countries in the developing world? We address these questions in the UK case using a survey experiment where we ask respondents to compare either the likelihood, severity or priority for government action of pairs of risks. We examine these questions across a set of 25 different climate risks which affect both the UK and countries in the developing world, which map onto the full set of risks identified in the UK government climate change risk assessment, and 22 non-climate risks of differing levels of likelihood and severity. This novel approach allows us to present the first systematic mapping of partisan disagreement over a full set of climate risks, and directly compare partisan disagreement on questions of likelihood, severity, and prioritisation for government action. Our approach also makes it possible to examine if partisan differences in how specific climate problems are prioritized follows the structure expected in the existing political science and psychological literatures on climate concern.

"abstract_0041_0476_0708.html","Chaos at the Polls: How Electoral Disruptions Affect Voter Perceptions of Integrity and Democratic Satisfaction","The extant literature has found a positive relationship between electoral integrity (perceptions) and satisfaction with democracy. Most previous research has relied on citizens’ subjective perceptions of electoral fraud and other factors affecting electoral integrity, as measured in large-scale cross-sectional data. In contrast, the influence of more direct experiences of electoral fraud and disruption is less clear. This study leverages on the electoral disruptions that occurred during the 2021 German federal elections in Berlin to examine whether individuals' personal experiences of electoral irregularities exert an influence on their perceptions of electoral integrity and satisfaction with democratic processes. Voters in Berlin experienced a range of disruptions to the electoral process, including prolonged queues, missing ballot papers and discrepancies in closing times. The irregularities were of such a significant nature that the Federal Constitutional Court ordered a repetition of the elections in a considerable number of districts. The setting of the 2021 elections serves as a quasi-natural experiment, allowing for a comparison between citizens residing in Berlin and in the remaining 15 German states, where these disruptions did not occur. A difference-in-differences analysis is conducted using originally collected pre- and post-election survey data to compare changes in both integrity perceptions and satisfaction with democracy before and after the (chaotic) election. The survey data include a comprehensive seven-item battery of integrity perceptions, covering the administrative conduct of the elections.

Prior research indicates that women in youth parties are equally likely to aspire to non-electoral party positions but less likely to have the ambition to run for public office. This article investigates whether encouragement can close the gender gap in electoral ambition, whether women are equally likely to act on this ambition, and whether the source of encouragement influences outcomes. Using a broad-based self-collected survey of youth party members in Germany (2017-2018, n = 1293), the findings show that when actively encouraged to run for public office, women show the same electoral political ambition as men, and the gender gap in ambition disappears. Still, in some parties, women are still less likely to act on their ambition even after being encouraged. Lastly, encouragement by peers rather than parent party members seems helpful in increasing electoral political ambition. Examining these career dynamics is crucial for understanding and addressing the barriers to women's political participation within traditionally male-dominated (youth) party structures.","Keywords: youth parties, careers, political ambition, gender gap","Clint Claessen","Clint Claessen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A set-theoretical analysis of evidence from the Covid-19 Pandemic","This article examines the determinants of multi-level states’ responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. It first maps out three categories of responses (non-coordination, coordination, centralisation) across 13 OECD countries over four time-periods in 2020. It then presents a theoretical framework drawn from public choice theory that specifies how these outcomes are shaped by how the pressures of the outbreak are mediated by institutional, sociological and party-political conditions. The findings of the fuzzy-set qualitative-comparative analysis (fsQCA) are that a necessary condition for non-coordination is the presence of a vertical party-political conflict, while for coordination it is the presence of shared-rule institutions. But this effect is asymmetric: shared-rule institutions do not preclude centralisation in countries with high population density and party-political consensus.

"abstract_0045_1889_0727.html","Justifying Border Policies: An experimental study of Government Strategies and Public Perception in the EU","Europe’s internal border politics are increasingly politicized, with several member states recently reintroducing Schengen controls and challenging the principle of free movement. Although often framed as temporary responses to external threats - such as surges in migration or public health crises - these policies risk normalizing restrictive border measures, even for EU citizens. This study examines how government justifications for altering border policies (i.e., introducing or lifting controls) shape public support, perceived legitimacy, and trust in political authorities.We first identify distinct justification strategies employed by the German government from 2013 to 2023, examining how different aims (e.g., security, economy) and processes (e.g., legal compliance, effectiveness, solidarity) are used to justify policy shifts. Building on these insights, we conduct a multi-factorial survey experiment in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. Participants are exposed to hypothetical government communications featuring varied justifications, allowing us to test their causal impact on public opinion and trust.We expect that certain justifications will bolster support for border restrictions, enhance perceptions of policy legitimacy, and increase trust in political authorities. By experimentally assessing the effectiveness of these strategies, our findings illuminate the mechanisms through which governments shape public perceptions of border control. This has significant implications for the sustainability of open borders, the resilience of European integration, and the future of trust in (EU) institutions.","Keywords: Schengen, Border controls, Justification, European integration, Public Opinion","Lisa Herbig","Lisa Herbig","University of Amsterdam"," Theresa Kuhn","University of Amsterdam","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0046_1397_1139.html","The Importance of Forum to Emotional Expression for Extreme Candidates","Conventional wisdom holds that populist politicians are more negative, emotional, and angry speakers than others (e.g., Nai 2021). Yet, fringe political figures are also known to act strategically when it comes to their leaders’ images, policy positions, and the language they use to advance their political causes. This pressure may make populist politicians moderate their stronger or more negative emotions in front of a general audience, as in a nationally televised election debate, but to be more expressive in front of supporters. In one of the largest multimedia inquiries into politicians’ emotional expression in different forums (televised debates and interviews; campaign events; the parliamentary setting; freeform web content), we assess whether fringe figures are more moderate in emotionality in front of a larger audience than in front of their core supporters, and how populists compare to non-populist speakers. We use deep learning tools (MEXCA), and/or direct vocal measurements (amplitude and pitch changes), to assess politicians’ emotional activation levels across different settings. As previous research indicates that non-populists engage in emotionally activated speech at similar rates to populists in televised debates (Moez 2024), we investigate whether the forum of speech, and its strategic incentives, drive this result.","Keywords: audiovisual data analysis; audio data analysis; quantitative analysis of political communication; populism and emotional expression","Catherine Moez","Catherine Moez","Centre for the Politics of Feelings, SAS University of London; Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London","Manos Tsakiris","Centre for the Politics of Feelings, SAS University of London; Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Centre for the Politics of Feelings, SAS University of London","Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0047_1501_0787.html","A Natural Divide? Climate Change and Party Unity","Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges of our time and increasingly shapes how parties compete in Western Europe. Still, research on this topic, especially regarding intra-party politics, is relatively scarce.Natural disasters such as severe floods or heatwaves are particularly tangible phenomena of climate change. I argue that such drastic events have a differentiated impact on intra-party politics. In the wake of a natural disaster related to climate change, the salience of climate change should increase in politicians' communication across the full spectrum of the party landscape. At the same time, I expect the issue to become more polarized and to contribute to lower party unity, meaning that politicians within their parties will adopt more extreme, contradictory positions as climate change cuts across the traditional left-right spectrum.I test these expectations by studying members of parliaments’ communication on Twitter in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Using a novel supervised learning approach for classification, I detect Tweets about climate change and extract politicians’ attitudes towards this issue.The granularity of Twitter data allows me to exploit the occurrence of natural disasters as quasi-natural experiments for causal effect estimation. My findings further our understanding of party unity on climate change, which is essential for taking swift action in the fight against climate change.","Keywords: Climate change, intra-party politics, text analysis","David Schweizer","David Schweizer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0048_0666_0794.html","How strategic are party members when voting for party leaders? Evidence from a conjoint experiment","To what extent are party members willing to trade off policy preferences for electoral gains in their leadership preferences? In most democracies, party members hold a monopoly over leader selection. However, the factors driving their vote choices remain largely unexplored, and the lack of experimental evidence prevents causal claims. Party members are often taken as more ideologically extreme than party voters and leaders. Recent evidence shows that youth wing members are even more extreme. Given this, do they vote for ideologically extreme leaders, or are they willing to compromise on policy to reach office? While policy, office, and votes are key goals for parties, the relative importance of each remains uncertain. Leveraging a conjoint survey experiment of Portuguese party members (n=3500), I examine whether and why party members prioritize policy agreement over electability in leadership contests. The results show that members are not willing to trade off policy preferences for electoral gains, and that youth wing members are even more ideological than their older counterparts. These findings have broad implications for the literature on political representation, voting behavior, party leadership and candidate selection, the personalization of politics, intra-party democracy, and the growing study of party youth wings.","Keywords: party leadership, party members, voting behavior, youth wings, political parties, conjoint experiment.","Hugo Ferrinho Lopes","Hugo Ferrinho Lopes",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Lisbon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conduct a survey experiment in seven NATO countries, presenting scenarios in which Russia invades either a NATO member state (Estonia) or a non-member state (Moldova). Relying on an Audience Cost Theory (ACT) framework, we asked respondents to evaluate their leaders’ responses to the Russian invasion and to provide a justification for their support, or lack thereof, in an open-ended question. We analyse more than 40,000 responses using text-as-data classifying methods to identify the specific mechanisms shaping public opinion on military alliances. The contribution we provide is threefold. First, we test whether support for alliances is driven by solidarity and moral reasoning, ideological postures or more instrumental arguments. Second, we assess whether ACT’s hypothesised mechanisms (i.e., inconsistency, belligerence, outcome) are indeed reflected respondents’ answers. Third, we apply novel text-analysis techniques to open-ended responses in a survey experiment, showing both the pros and cons of these methods in a rather unexplored field.","Keywords: military alliances, survey experiment, text-analysis, public opinion, war","Matteo CM Casiraghi","Matteo CM Casiraghi","Department of International Relations and International Organizations, University of Groningen","Francesco Olmastroni","Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Sergio Martini","Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Pierangelo Isernia","Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Valerio Vignoli","Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","","","","","","","","","","","Department of International Relations and International Organizations, University of Groningen","Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While salaries play a crucial role in shaping politicians’ behaviour and selection, their effect on voters' trust remains underexplored. We develop a theoretical framework suggesting that salary increases reduce institutional trust, with more pronounced declines observed for larger salary changes. Empirically, we exploit the natural experiment of the 2009 MEP pay reform, which standardized salaries across EU member states, replacing nationally determined pay scales with a uniform salary funded by the EU budget.Using Eurobarometer survey data from 2005 to 2013, we employ an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to evaluate the reform's impact. Our results reveal a decrease in public trust in the European Parliament following the harmonization. The effect is heterogeneous, with countries experiencing the largest salary increases showing the sharpest declines in trust. These findings align with Public Choice Theory and fairness perception frameworks, underscoring voters' sensitivity to perceived self-serving behaviour by politicians.This research bridges literature gaps by empirically connecting political compensation changes to institutional trust. It emphasizes the broader implications for policymaking, transparency, and public engagement, offering insights into the intricate dynamics between governance incentives and public perceptions.","Keywords: Institutional trust, Members of European Parliament, Pay harmonization, Eurobarometer","Sergi Urzay-Gómez","Sergi Urzay-Gómez","Universitat Internacional de Catalunya","Guadalupe Correa-Lopera","Universidad de Granada","David Medina-Rodríguez","CUNEF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Internacional de Catalunya","Universidad de Granada","CUNEF",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0051_1131_1335.html","Growing Up Together: How Early Exposure to Diversity Moderates Opposition to Immigration","This study examines how exposure to foreigners shapes immigration attitudes. Despite decades of research and many valuable contributions, the empirical evidence remains inconclusive, reflecting a broader theoretical divide between group threat (Blumer 1958) and contact theories (Allport 1979). This paper introduces a new theoretical framework that reconciles the existing contradictory findings. It proposes that while an increased presence of foreigners diminishes local support for immigration, early exposure to diversity moderates this effect. It further hypothesises that such exposure during childhood and adolescence fosters positive intergroup relations later in life, whereas sustained exposure in adulthood may not mitigate the negative effects. To test these hypotheses, the paper leverages fine-grained geolocalised panel data from Switzerland (1999-2020) and the Czech Republic (2015-2019). It offers several innovative operationalisations of early socialisation and habituation, spanning from individuals’ exposure to foreigners during their formative years at the municipal level to geographic proximity to high-exposure areas, such as major urban centres and cross-border regions. The results show that the presence of foreigners in respondents’ localities of residence exerts an immediate negative effect on their support for immigration. Interestingly, locals who grew up in areas with a higher presence of foreigners are less likely to react negatively to the new influx. By contrast, prolonged exposure to foreigners in adulthood does not moderate the negative effect of exposure. These findings carry important implications for our understanding of how exposure and early socialisation affect intra-group relations, shedding light on the long-term impact of demographic shifts on immigration attitudes.","Keywords: immigration attitudes, socialisation, residential exposure","Eva Krejcova","Eva Krejcova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University InstituteIDHEAP, Université de Lausanne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on academic publication data we propose a measurement strategy that captures the output of critical social science at the level of universities, subnational locations and countries. Using our measure of critical social science, we chart its rise over time and space, and analyze its historical origins in radical student protest movements. Specifically, we look at whether the intensity and incidence of mass student protests 1968-1978 affects the university-level output of critical social science in the following decades. Our contribution highlights the importance of political history for understanding the trajectory of the social sciences, and how this can be studied rigorously in a large-n framework.","Keywords: text analysis, protest, historical political economy, radicalism, education","Tore Wig, Frederik Hjorth, Martin Søyland, Eli Baltzersen","Tore Wig","University of Oslo","Frederik Hjorth","University of Copenhagen","Martin Søyland","University of Oslo","Eli Baltzersen","University of Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A prominent policy response advanced by many is greater government regulation and scrutiny of the adoption of AI technology by governments and private actors. This paper presents new hypotheses and fresh evidence about the determinants and support for such regulation across a wide variety of AI domains (including data privacy, misinformation, security, labor substitution, and discrimination). We theorize that support for regulatory support should be shaped by three sets of arguments: about the risks that AI poses, about the costs of regulation, and about the non-government alternatives available to regulate AI, and that such arguments should carry similar weight across the relevant AI policy sphere in question. We gather new survey data from large samples in six countries where AI investment and discussion are increasing (China, Germany, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, United States) from April-August 2024 to test our hypotheses. We find strong support that all three types of arguments can affect AI regulatory support across many policy domains for most countries. However, across most policy domains, invoking the regulatory costs decreases regulatory support the most, indicating that citizen concern about AI can be reduced if key costs are made salient.","Keywords: AI, technology, regulation","Aina Gallego, Alexander Kuo","Aina Gallego","University of Barcelona","Alexander Kuo","University of Barcelona","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Barcelona","IBEI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, whether the opposition candidate, once elected, will provide them with promised public goods. Second, whether they can sanction the politician should she renege. I argue that partisans' fears of exclusion and inability to punish shirking is much lower in electoral districts where parties' supporters live side-by-side (partisan nonsegregated) and elections are competitive compared to other electoral settings. Accordingly, partisans are more likely to cross party lines in nonsegregated and competitive constituencies than in other settings. Using a conjoint experiment administered to voters sampled from a stratified sample of constituencies in Ghana, I show that voters in competitive, nonsegregated districts are the most willing to cross party lines. Additional data on voters' perceptions of actual public goods distribution supports the mechanism. My results demonstrate how partisan geography and electoral competition can jointly shape political accountability.","Keywords: Partisanship, vote choice, legislators, political accountability, African Politics.","George Ofosu","George Ofosu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While democratic language remains a common feature across autocratizing regimes, there is significant variation in how leaders invoke and manipulate core democratic concepts during their consolidation of power. This study examines how the semantic meaning of foundational democratic principles evolves throughout periods of democratic backsliding, and investigates the conditions under which leaders either persist with or abandon democratic rhetoric in favor of overtly authoritarian language. Using a word embeddings approach on an original corpus of political speeches, we analyze how changing external pressures, particularly international conditionality and investment partnerships, influence these rhetorical shifts. Our findings contribute to the public discourse perspective within the debate on contemporary autocratization processes and the erosion of democratic norms, while shedding light on the strategic calculus of would-be autocrats in maintaining regime legitimacy through discourse manipulation.","Keywords: democracy, backsliding, autocratization, autocracy, text-as-data","Giovanni Pagano","Giovanni Pagano","University of Milan"," Tiziana Corda","University of Milan","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Milan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a multi-region model of trade, differences in trade costs create uneven gains and losses from liberalization. This heterogeneity provides a basis for political divisions over trade policy, even in the absence of sector or factor differences. Some areas gain from lower prices and export opportunities, but regions that sell into those areas face greater competition. I calibrate this model to data on regional trade flows in the US to quantify these uneven gains and losses. This new measure captures different variation than commonly-used measures of trade exposure that ignore the geographic context. The modeled gains from liberalization are predictive of support for trade by voters and legislators, including in specifications that exploit within-unit variation in trade gains with different partners.

"abstract_0057_0933_0294.html","Unearthing Discontent: Mining Ownership, Extraction, and Socio-environmental Protest in Peru (PECEGS)","The global push for a green transition has intensified demand for minerals critical to renewable energy technologies, much of which are sourced from resource-rich regions like Latin America. Peru, a leading producer of these minerals, has become a focal point for mining investments, but the sector’s expansion has sparked widespread societal unrest. Communities often bear the brunt of mining’s negative externalities, including water scarcity, environmental degradation, and economic inequalities, raising questions about the equity of the green transition. This paper examines the conditions under which mining operations provoke societal protests, focusing on the role of firm ownership and operational scale in shaping local opposition.Using monthly data from 194 Peruvian provinces between 2006 and 2020, we analyze the impact of firm nationality and ownership changes on protest onset, hypothesizing that sites operated by foreign firms from high-income countries face fewer protests due to stricter environmental and social standards. Conversely, sites owned by Chinese firms are expected to face heightened resistance due to perceptions of resource exploitation and lower environmental oversight. We also investigate how extraction volume and resource type moderate these effects, as more intensive or environmentally harmful mining is likely to exacerbate tensions.Employing two-way fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, we reveal how firm ownership structures and local conditions intersect to influence societal unrest. By situating mining within the broader context of global green transformations, this paper highlights the unequal burdens of resource extraction and offers insights into the governance challenges of a just green transition.","Keywords: mining, protest, green transition, Latin America","Patrick Wagner","Viktoria Jansesberger","University of Konstanz"," Patrick Wagner","University of Konstanz"," Gabriele Spilker","University of Konstanz","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has demonstrated a strong link between customary institutions and peace, yet the specific institutional functions influencing pastoralist violence remain poorly understood. I address this gap by proposing that effective governance – whether formal or customary – depends on three essential functions related to the creation, enforcement, and adjudication of rules. Drawing on unique field-collected data from Madagascar, I examine how formalized customary institutions, locally known as ‘dina’, shape regional variations in violence across two regions in southern Madagascar. This area has witnessed an unprecedented surge in pastoralist violence over the past decade, driven by violent cattle raids carried out by organized criminal groups known as ‘dahalo’. Amidst this turmoil, some regions have remained relatively peaceful, and in this article, I explore whether differences in customary institutional traits can explain regional variations in pastoralist violence. My analysis reveals that a high degree of community involvement in rule making, combined with an efficient enforcement mechanism, is essential for effectively mitigating pastoralist violence. Furthermore, a just and impartial adjudication process fosters greater institutional trust, which also contributes to reducing violence. These findings carry significant policy implications, highlighting the specific characteristics of formalized customary institutions that are critical for addressing the rapidly escalating violence associated with cattle raiding in Africa.","Keywords: Customary institutions, Communal violence, Pastoralist violence, Conflict management, Crime","Patrick Wennström","Patrick Wennström",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala UniversityCentre of Natural Hazards and Disaster Science (CNDS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0061_0812_0440.html","Social Desirability Bias: A Blind Spot in the Measurement of Extremist Attitudes","The spread of extremist attitudes is a critical issue in democratic societies. However, the direct measurement of extremist attitudes may be biased by social desirability. Participants may conceal their extremist attitudes in surveys to avoid stigmatization, as such attitudes contradict the democratic principles upheld by society. Previous research relies on direct survey items that do not account for social desirability bias.To my knowledge, this study is the first to address this gap by measuring social desirability bias in right-wing, left-wing, and religious extremist attitudes, examining which groups are most affected by this bias, and testing whether factors found in previous extremism research are relevant after controlling for social desirability bias. The study includes 6,200 respondents from Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands and combines direct items of right-wing, left-wing, and religious extremist attitudes with list experiments.I show that social desirability bias is highest in religious extremist attitudes (~11%-35%). In contrast, social desirability bias remains lower in left-wing extremist attitudes (~10%) and right-wing extremist attitudes (~9%). Across all forms of extremist attitudes, men and younger respondents are most prone to social desirability, while educational attainment has ambiguous effects on social desirability bias. After controlling for social desirability, many factors found in previous studies show no or inconsistent correlations with extremist attitudes (e.g., political alienation). Only authoritarian personality traits are significantly correlated with all forms of extremist attitudes.Therefore, future research on extremist attitudes should test findings by considering the bias induced by social desirability and including indirect measurement approaches.","Keywords: social desirability bias, list experiment, extremist attitudes","Nina Osenbrügge","Nina Osenbrügge",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"MZES, University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0062_2483_0473.html","Accountability, Representation, and Tradeoffs in Electoral Engineering","Does the design of electoral systems entail a choice between political accountability and representation? While a significant body of research in comparative politics and political economy suggests so, others argue that these tradeoffs are contingent and weak. We develop a formal model which combines conflict between voters over policy and agency problems between voters and politicians; and we solve the model for plurality voting (PV) and proportional representation (PR) systems. At a basic level, we demonstrate that a system's representativeness and its accountability patterns are jointly determined: representing the median interests and removing low quality politicians are informed by the same set of strategic decisions. There exist both 'sweet-spots' and 'sours-pots' in the parameter space where both systems are equally effective or ineffective, respectively, in generating representation and accountability. In other contexts one system will clearly outperform the other on one or both of dimensions. The tradeoff identified in past studies, in which PV is optimal for accountability but PR optimal for representation, in fact only arises in limited circumstances; and the reverse tradeoff in which PV is optimal for representation but PR optimal for accountability is also possible. Three parameters determine the impact of electoral institutions: political polarization, social heterogeneity, and divergence between the national-level and district-level median voters.

The (in)effectiveness of immigration deterrence policies","Policymakers across Europe are once again proposing to enhance punitive measures against asylum seekers as a strategy to deter prospective migrants from attempting to reach their respective countries. This paper examines the following question: Are restrictive immigration policies effective in reducing irregular and asylum-seeking immigration? Adopting a process-tracing approach, the study investigates the case of the United Kingdom, analysing whether migrants are aware of asylum policies before arriving and whether such awareness influences their decision to migrate to the UK.The UK serves as an 'extreme case' of deterrence-oriented immigration policies. At the time of fieldwork in 2024, the Conservative government had enacted legislation that effectively constituted a 'ban on asylum' and was preparing to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda.Drawing on 50 interviews conducted with migrants residing in Calais and intending to reach the UK, the analysis reveals a disparity in migrants’ knowledge of British asylum policies. While they are generally well-informed about access control policies (that govern entry and removal) like the Rwanda plan, they are poorly informed about determination process (that determine how asylum claims are processed) and integration policies (that regulate their access to rights). This suggests that implementing restrictive determination process and integration policies with the aim of curbing immigration is inefficient. Restrictive policies cannot deter people who are unaware of their existence. Overall, these findings challenge the dominant rationale underpinning the implementation of restrictive immigration policies to deter unwanted immigration.","Keywords: Policy effectiveness; asylum; irregular immigration; border control","Tiphaine Le Corre","Tiphaine Le Corre",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Nuffield College, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We call this conditional independence in missing-data analysis (CIMDA). We propose a general test of CIMDA that exploits the power of machine learning algorithms to accurately and efficiently identify complex patterns of missingness and relationships between variables. Our test compares the generalization error of supervised learning models trained on samples that include and exclude the outcome variable. Large differences in model performance indicate a low likelihood that CIMDA holds, creating a serious risk that omitting incomplete rows will bias regression estimates. We validate the test through a series of experimental studies involving simulated as well as real social science data. Applications to regression analyses from recently published studies illustrate both the inferential pitfalls of potential CIMDA violations and the utility of our test in guiding analysts toward appropriate missing-data strategies.

While it is well-known that parties used clientelist practices in Italy's First Republic to remain in power, less understood is if and how international funding can be leveraged for these same ends, and for how long these effects last. We critically examine these dynamics by investigating how and why post-war Italian MPs channeled Marshall Plan funding to their hometowns. Our analysis implements an innovate close-election RDD design which models the complex post-war electoral system designed by American and Italian interlocutors. We find that not only did MPs successfully channel Marshall Plan financing to their hometowns, but that the effect is also stronger for constituencies of Christian Democratic MPs. We also determine that the Marshall Plan created legacies of towns and comunes which had enough funding to outpace investments in surrounding areas, thereby generating grievances and more support for the far-right in the long-run in towns which missed opportunities for US project financing after WWII. The paper's contributions are two-fold: first, we demonstrate that international Western financing is beneficial in creating clientelist ties with home constituencies in Western states. Second, we validate the long-term behavioral effects of foreign aid on political attitudes and preferences. Our paper has implications for the short and long-run political effects which policymakers can expect from other types of international transfers – like EU funds.","Keywords: Clientelism; developed political economy; Marshall Plan; close-election RDD; reconstruction","Sienna Nordquist","Sienna Nordquist","Bocconi University"," Simone Cremaschi","Bocconi University"," Catherine De Vries","Bocconi University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0067_2105_0592.html","The Globalization Backlash in Rural Areas: Price Shocks, Far Right Support, and the Limits of Agricultural Subsidies","In recent years, the world has witnessed a rising backlash against globalization, yet much remains unknown about the policy responses to this phenomenon. This paper investigates how economic volatility influences political behavior in rural areas and examines whether redistributive policies can mitigate its effects. Grounded in theories of economic insecurity and political backlash, we argue that sharp declines in the prices of locally produced agricultural goods significantly increase the likelihood of rural communes voting for far-right parties, reflecting a shift toward protectionist preferences. We test this hypothesis in France (2008–2024) using a shift-share instrument based on global price trends and local production patterns to identify the causal effect of price volatility. The study further explores the role of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in moderating these dynamics. By integrating cantonal voting data, variation in CAP subsidies, an original survey of 1,542 farmers matched with administrative records, and qualitative interviews, we find that CAP funding fails to alleviate the economic insecurity stemming from price fluctuations. This research contributes to debates on the political consequences of globalization by offering novel insights into how redistributive policies might address the socioeconomic roots of political extremism. It underscores the importance of designing effective interventions to counter the globalization backlash and its far-reaching political implications.","Keywords: globalization backlash, far right support, price volatility, farmers, CAP","Giorgio Malet","Giorgio Malet","ETH Zürich","Diane Bolet","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zürich","University of Essex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0068_1217_0711.html","Do Populists Really Care about Democracy? A Cross-Country Analysis of Populist Attitudes and Democratic Values","This paper explores the relationship between populist attitudes and democratic values using original survey data collected in Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Poland (N > 10,000). Acknowledging the complexity of both concepts, we propose a Multidimensional Populist Attitudes Scale (MPAS) that distinguishes three dimensions of populism: anti-systemic, personalistic leadership, and identitarian. These dimensions are examined in relation to trust in democratic institutions, support for a liberal conception of democracy, traditional values, and the perceived importance of living in a democracy. Results suggest that populist attitudes are far from homogeneous, with different dimensions showing varying associations with democratic values. While anti-systemic attitudes are linked to distrust in institutions, they also exhibit a positive correlation with the importance of democracy, particularly when controlling for other political factors. Conversely, identitarian populism appears more strongly associated with illiberal values and traditionalist views, while the personalistic dimension shows mixed results across contexts. These findings reveal important cross-country variations, suggesting that national political and cultural factors shape the relationship between populist attitudes and democratic values. The study highlights the limitations of unidimensional populism measures and demonstrates the utility of a multidimensional approach for capturing the nuances of populist attitudes. Overall, this research contributes to ongoing debates on populism’s implications for democracy, emphasizing that populist citizens may simultaneously express dissatisfaction with the liberal-democratic model while maintaining support for democratic principles in general.","Keywords: populist attitudes, democratic values, EFA","Enrique Clari, José Javier Olivas Osuna","Enrique Clari","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","José Javier Olivas Osuna","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0069_2226_0987.html","The gendered pipeline from municipal to higher office","It is well established that women are less likely to seek to run for office while also composing a minority of potential candidate pools. In this study, we seek to measure whether women in an important candidate pool, municipal-level officeholders in the US, express similar levels of progressive ambition as their male counterparts and whether, conditional on that expressed ambition, run at similar rates. To do so, we surveyed 2,800 elected US municipal officials in 2016 about their desires to run for higher office, and then 8 years later, we followed up on their political careers to identify what offices they had run for since being surveyed. So far, we have found that half of the local officials who indicated that they would definitely run for higher office in the future had done so. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine such data sources together to examine the gendered pipeline to higher office and to test whether we see a leakier pipeline for women even among low-level office holders who expressed ambition to run for higher office. If we find this to be the case, it means that women face additional hurdles to higher office even once they enter a likely candidate pool. On the other hand, if male and female municipal officials run for higher office at similar rates, it suggests that one key to increasing female representation at higher office is getting more women into the pipeline.","Keywords: gendered pipeline, progressive ambition","Adam Dynes","Alejandra Aldridge","Brigham Young University"," Adam Dynes","Brigham Young University"," Anna Nakaya","Brigham Young University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Brigham Young University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0070_1458_0991.html","Gender in the Journals Revisited: A Comprehensive Look at Trends Across Five Decades","A recent debate sparked by Teele and Thelen (2017) revealed a significant gender gap in political science publishing, with women and particularly all-female teams publishing much less frequently than their male counterparts. Follow-up studies confirmed these patterns but were limited to small journal samples or short time frames. This paper, analyzing a rich new data set of over 100,000 articles from more than 70 leading political science journals published between 1975 and 2024, examines whether these trends are also apparent when analyzing a broader variety of journals and how they shifted over time.Our findings reveal three key trends. First, there is a clear decline in the dominance of solo-male authorship, with teams increasingly becoming the norm. Second, the proportion of articles authored exclusively by women doubled from 10% in the mid-1970s to 20% in the mid-2000s but has plateaued since then. Third, substantial variation in the gender composition of authorship emerges across journals and research topics.  These results underscore how shifts toward collaborative authorship and increased gender diversity have transformed the landscape of political science publishing. However, the enduring predominance of male authorship highlights the need for further investigation into structural and cultural barriers that may impede equity. This study contributes to broader conversations about diversity and inclusion in academia, offering a comprehensive foundation for future research and policy initiatives.","Keywords: authorship, gender gap, academic publishing, political science journals","Christina Gahn","Christina Gahn","University of Vienna"," Michael Imre","University of Vienna","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0071_2058_1090.html","Measuring Scientific Reasoning for Public Policy","Scientific reasoning is a critical component in shaping effective public policy, enabling both policymakers and the public to make informed decisions on complex issues. However, existing measures often fail to meet the specific methodological and applied demands of public policy contexts. This paper addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive measurement tool to assess scientific literacy in relation to public policy. The tool integrates knowledge of statistical reasoning, data literacy, causal inference, and the scientific method, alongside the ability to critically evaluate scientific information pertinent to policy debates. To ensure flexibility for researchers working under practical constraints such as survey time, we incorporate Item Response Theory (IRT) scaling to develop an adaptive inventory. This battery dynamically optimizes learning rates while adhering to survey length constraints, offering an efficient yet rigorous solution for data collection. Validation of the tool is undertaken using a diverse sample of policy professionals and lay respondents (n ≈ 500), enabling robust assessment across varied competency levels and demographic contexts. Preliminary findings indicate strong internal consistency and construct validity, with the tool effectively distinguishing between conceptual knowledge and applied competencies. Results also suggest that the adaptive format can enhance respondent engagement without compromising measurement precision. These findings have significant implications for public policy research, providing a scalable method to gauge scientific literacy and decision-making capacity amidst evolving scientific issues.","Keywords: Scientific reasoning, Public policy, Computer adaptive testing (CAT), Survey methodology","Simon Munzert","Sebastian Ramirez-Ruiz","Hertie School"," Simon Munzert","Hertie School","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0072_1964_0729.html","From Momentum to Meaning: Legislative Innovation and Impact in EU Policy Punctuations","This paper examines whether periods of sharply increased legislative activity—so-called policy punctuations—produce significant policy outputs in the European Union’s (EU) multifaceted governance environment. While punctuated equilibrium theory (PET) posits that public policies evolve through long stretches of stability interrupted by sudden, intense bursts of reform, the substantive significance of the resulting legislation often remains under-explored.To address this gap, the study draws on approximately 55,000 EU legislative documents and employs advanced NLP techniques and network analysis to measure legislative significance along two dimensions: innovation (the extent to which new laws depart from established policy frameworks) and impact (a law’s enduring influence within the legal network).The findings challenge the assumption that punctuations in EU legislative output lead to significant policy change. While policy punctuations are modestly associated with increased impact — laws adopted during these periods tend to endure and shape subsequent policymaking—they do not reliably foster more innovative legislation. Instead of fundamentally rethinking policy frameworks, EU lawmakers frequently respond to urgent problem pressures by consolidating and extending established approaches, rather than crafting novel solutions.These results refine our understanding of PET in the EU context by demonstrating that policy punctuations are less about radically redefining policy trajectories and more about strengthening and consolidating existing arrangements over time. They highlight the importance of assessing both innovation and impact to fully capture the significance of policy change. Ultimately, this study offers a more nuanced view of how dramatic shifts in legislative attention translate into substantive, long-term policy change within the EU.","Keywords: European Union, Legislative Significance, Policy Change, Punctuated Equilibrium, Natural Language Processing, Network Analysis","Constantin Kaplaner","Constantin Kaplaner",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"LMU, MunichZeppelin University, Friedrichshafen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0073_2009_1140.html","What is a Good Conversation?  Improving the Operationalization and Measurement of Deliberative Quality by Analyzing Interactions","Deliberation - the exchange of arguments to inform a collective understanding of an issue - is a key component of opinion formation and, therefore, democratic decision-making. Theorists of deliberation conceptualize deliberative quality as a property of entire communicative interactions, involving respect, justification, and reciprocal engagement. However, prior attempts at operationalization - both in the interpretive and computer science traditions - have treated each debate contribution, like a speech or online comment, as a single unit of analysis, ignoring the interactive nature of this process and failing to measure the deliberative quality of the entire communicative exchange. In this paper, we empirically show that operationalizing deliberation at the interaction level captures important aspects of the concept which cannot be measured when treating single debate contributions as distinct entities. Using data from three different online outlets, we show that large language models (LLMs) can achieve performance comparable to human annotators when evaluating deliberative quality in online conversations. Furthermore, we show that LLMs better identify the deliberative quality of an interaction, especially with regards to its reciprocity and respectfulness, when shown entire conversations, rather than individual comments separately. Based on a synthetic-labeling approach, we train and publish adapter modules, providing an off-the-shelf tool to researchers interested in the measurement of deliberative quality and its underlying dimensions.","Keywords: Deliberation, Measurement, NLP","Nicolai Berk","Nicolai Berk","ETH Zurich","Francisco Tomas-Valiente Jorda","ETH Zurich","Dominik Stammbach","Princeton University","Lena Song","University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Laura Bronner","ETH Zurich","Elliott Ash","ETH Zurich","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0074_1585_0789.html","The Politics of Climate Change Denial in Europe: Does Party Rhetoric Fuel Voters’ Climate Scepticism?","Amid escalating environmental crises, climate change scepticism persists and, in some cases, rises across Europe (Beiser-McGrath & Bernauer, 2021). Case study evidence from a limited number of European countries and the USA suggests that political parties play a critical role in shaping public scepticism by adopting increasingly sceptical stances. These positions often reflect a nuanced scepticism that acknowledges climate change while denying its anthropogenic origins or minimizing its impacts (Küppers, 2022). This study explores whether political parties influence their constituents’ beliefs by reframing narratives around climate science across 10 EU countries. We rely on automated text analysis of parliamentary speeches to assess party framing on climate scepticism. Party stances are quantified using a Party Climate Scepticism Index (PCSI), developed from the ParlaMint corpus of national parliamentary speeches. The PCSI measures the proportion of climate-sceptical segments within each party’s speeches on climate change. To construct the index, a binary text classification NLP model is trained using synthetic data generated through a zero-shot data augmentation strategy with ChatGPT and refined with human oversight. Active learning iteratively improves the model by selecting and annotating informative examples from unlabelled data, capturing the linguistic and rhetorical complexity of parliamentary debates. The PCSI is merged with European Social Survey data (2016, 2020) at the party level to assess whether shifts in party positions influence voter scepticism. Using a first-difference estimator and controlling for second-dimension political competition and welfare state systems, the analysis reveals that party discourse shapes EU constituents' climate scepticism across ideological contexts.","Keywords: Climate Change Scepticism, Environmental Politics, NLP, European Politics, Party Influence","Pietro Michael Lepidi, Francesco Albanese","Pietro Michael Lepidi","University of Bologna, Department of Political and Social Sciences"," Francesco Albanese","University of Bologna, Department of Political and Social Sciences","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Bologna, Department of Political and Social Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0075_1280_0792.html","The Temporal Dimension of Issue Competition: When Are Parties Going Off-Topic and Which Issues Do They Sacrifice?","When do parties engage in issue competition and which subjects do they sacrifice when establishing their preferred issues on the political agenda? Parties consistently aim to shape the focus of political debates strategically, and the issues they prioritize have been the subject of significant attention over the past decades. However, we still lack a systematic understanding of both the timing of these efforts as well as the question of which competing issues, by consequence, receive diminished attention. To fill this gap, we apply state-of-the-art fine-tuned transformer models for topic classification on a full sample of parliamentary speeches and legislative bills from the German Bundestag (2009-2021) and the Austrian Nationalrat (1996-2020). We then triangulate and interlink the classified speeches and bills with party manifesto data, providing precise and fine-grained insights into parties’ issue attention patterns. We find that parties are increasingly likely to engage in issue competition when the current political agenda becomes less advantageous — both due to lower public salience or reduced prominence of issues in their manifestos. In these instances, parties pivot toward more advantageous issue domains, guided by the same principles. Hence, parties use the salience of policy realms in public discourse or within their programmatic orientation not only as a guiding principle for selecting the issues to emphasize but also for determining the timing of these efforts and the subjects to neglect. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the temporal dimension of issue competition dynamics in representative democracies.","Keywords: Issue Competition; Public Opinion; Party Behaviour; Transformer-Models","Elias Koch","Elias Koch","Hertie School; Research Training Group DYNAMICS","Christoph Ivanusch","Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School","Research Training Group DYNAMICS","Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present evidence from a survey experiment administered to members of national parliaments (MPs) in seven NATO countries. In the experiment, we envision a scenario whereby pro-Russian military forces attack a NATO member (Estonia) manipulating whether voters of the MP’s own political party support or oppose a potential military intervention to assist Estonia in restoring security. Our study provides three key contributions. First, by experimentally investigating elite positions on the use of force and alliances, we contribute to a relatively scarce body of literature, highlighting whether public opinion influences political elites’ support for military engagement and other policy responses. Second, we offer novel theoretical insights about the policy preference “disconnects” between voters and politicians, showing how electoral incentives can moderate ideological positions on relevant international issues. Finally, our analysis sheds light on the relationship between military alliances, public opinion and foreign policy decision-making amidst renewed international tensions in Europe and the prospect of potential US disengagement.","Keywords: survey experiments, political elites, war, military alliances, electoral constituencies","Matteo CM Casiraghi","Francesco Olmastroni","Department of Social Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Sergio Martini","Department of Social Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Valerio Vignoli","Department of Social Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Fabrizio Coticchia","Department of Political and International Sciences, University of Genoa","Matteo CM Casiraghi","Department of International Relations and International Organizations, University of Groningen","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Social Political and Cognitive Sciences, University of Siena","Department of Political and International Sciences, University of Genoa","Department of International Relations and International Organizations, University of Groningen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The team’s status, and so the benefits to membership, improves if and only if it attracts talented recruits. If there is noise in a team’s evolving fortunes, then there is a unique equilibrium in which such recruits join the team if and only if its status exceeds a unique threshold. This threshold responds to the benefits of membership, the recruits’ outside options, the recruitment procedure, the heterogeneity of recruit types, and their preferences over playing, winning, and losing with different competing teams. Applications extend beyond firms to include the participation of good politicians in governments, the relative performance of sports teams, and rivalry between academic departments. Most importantly, our leading application is to the endogenous formation of a cabinet’s talent pool.","Keywords: Pol Econ section","Torun Dewan","Torun Dewan","London School of Economics","David P.

"abstract_0078_1550_1338.html","Irregular immigration and support for the reintroduction of national border controls: Evidence from Germany","Several member states of the Schengen free-travel area recently introduced temporary controls at their national borders to control and limit irregular immigration. In the summer of 2024, Germany's decision to reinstate checks at all its borders led other member states to follow suit, thereby threatening the future of free travelling inside the Schengen area. While political elites claim that such measures reflect public demands, it remains unclear how supportive citizens actually are. In this paper, we therefore investigate public opinion on border controls, focusing on the trade-offs citizens are willing to accept for stricter immigration policies. We argue that citizens are more likely to support border controls if they experience minimal personal consequences. By contrast, citizens are less supportive when significant individual-level consequences arise, such as travel delays or disruptions in their daily work commute. We test our argument by conducting an observational and experimental study in Germany. With immigration numbers being continuously high and the topic showing strong political salience due to the federal election taking place in February 2024, Germany offers a particularly interesting case. Our findings have implications not only for discrepancies between elite communication and public opinion but also for immigration policies and the future of European integration.","Keywords: Public Opinion, Border Controls,  European Union, Irregular Immigration","Korinna Lindemann","Korinna Lindemann","MZES, University of Mannheim","Lucas Schramm","Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MZES, University of Mannheim","Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines the circumstances under which automation exposure can lead to support for the political establishment--rather than populist movements--by focusing on voting patterns in the United States during the Post-War period. Utilizing both fixed-effect and instrumental variable estimations, the research investigates whether the observed relationship between automation and anti-establishment, right-wing political support is a contemporary phenomenon or part of a long-standing trend. Contrary to contemporary outcomes, the findings reveal that higher exposure to automation led to increased support for both incumbents and left-wing parties during this period, providing evidence that this relationship is more nuanced that originally thought. To understand these dynamics, the study tests the role of political supply, the availability of new work, and levels of political trust in mediating this relationship. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how societies navigate the challenges posed by technological change and its implications for democratic stability.","Keywords: Technological Change, Automation, Historical Political Economy, Political Behavior, Populism, Political Outcomes, Economic Disruption","Brady Allardice","Brady Allardice",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding how different dimensions of polarization emerge and interact in nascent democracies is crucial for preventing such escalation. In this study, we examine these dynamics in Kyrgyzstan, where rising societal divisions create an important case for analyzing polarization processes. We examine polarization through four key dimensions: dispersion of attitudes, bimodality of positions, ideological polarization, and identity-based polarization. Using the Life in Kyrgyzstan (LiK) Study's panel data spanning from 2010 to 2025, combined with ethnographic fieldwork and a list experiment embedded in the final survey wave to measure sensitive aspects of polarization, we investigate how polarization manifests and evolves over time. The research addresses three fundamental questions: the level and temporal evolution of polarization in Kyrgyzstan, the primary drivers of extreme social, religious, and political attitudes, and community-level responses to polarization and extremism. By combining large-scale panel data with experimental and ethnographic methods, this study provides new theoretical and empirical insights into how different dimensions of polarization interact and potentially reinforce each other in societies undergoing rapid social change.","Keywords: political polarization; extremism; panel data; Central Asia","Francisca Castro","Francisca Castro","International Security and Development Center; Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Damir Esenaliev","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops (IGZ)","Wolfgang Stojetz","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Security and Development Center","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops (IGZ)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0082_2424_0121.html","Mobilizing the Demobilized: Authoritarian Regime Inducements to Participation in Conflict","Many modern authoritarian regimes rely on the political demobilization of the public—often taking the form of complaisant, cynical disengagement from politics—to ensure pliancy and inertness (Alyukov 2022; Shields 2021). At the same time, these regimes often appeal to existential external threats to produce a rally-round-the-flag effect or a sense of legitimacy (Hellmeier 2021). When so much effort is put into politically demobilizing the public, how can such regimes then mobilize the population to voluntarily participate in the regime’s chosen causes? We preregistered and fielded a survey experiment in Russia in late 2024, in the midst of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to investigate the effectiveness of mobilizational strategies on a politically demobilized public. Following from ongoing debates about the material or ideational nature of Russia’s efforts to secure participation in its war efforts, this paper investigates three mobilizational strategies that the regime can use: financial inducements, patriotic appeals, and social conformism. This research contributes to literatures on political mobilization in autocracies, authoritarian legitimation, and individuals’ motivations to fight. We also demonstrate the limits of authoritarian regimes’ abilities to motivate the public to join in their violent endeavors, no matter the supposed benefits to doing so.","Keywords: Authoritarianism, Russia, conflict, experiment, survey","Noah Buckley","Noah Buckley","Trinity College Dublin","Nikita Khokhlov","University College Dublin","Daniil Romanov","Oxford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trinity College Dublin","University College Dublin","Oxford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0083_1098_0225.html","Welfare, supply chains, and globalization preferences","How does the welfare state shape attitudes toward globalization? The prevailing view, encapsulated in the idea of ‘embedded liberalism’, is that welfare states partially offset the losses from globalization, resulting in more positive attitudes toward economic globalization. In particular, the losers from globalization are more supportive of globalization where welfare states are strong. In this paper, we provide a different perspective on the link between welfare states and attitudes toward globalization. We argue that welfare states not just compensate the losers from globalization, but shape more immediately who wins and who loses from globalization in the first place. Expansive welfare states push firms further down in the global supply chain, toward the production of more complex goods downstream. We offer evidence from three studies for several implications from this argument. First, leveraging firm-level data with nearly 5 million observations, we find that downstream firms fare better economically in expansive welfare states. Second, in product-level trade data, we observe that downstream products are exported more in expansive welfare states. Third, drawing on several sets of survey data, we show that employees in downstream firms voice stronger support for globalization in expansive welfare states, and prefer more redistribution in weaker welfare states. We offer a new argument linking welfare states with globalization preferences, identify a new source of cleavages over globalization, and highlight the importance of redistributive politics for the politics over globalization.","Keywords: Globalization; preferences; welfare; global supply chains; downstreamness","Søren Frank Etzerodt","Timm Betz","Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)","Søren Frank Etzerodt","Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)","Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We then analyze a factor that moderates the relationship between climate vulnerability and climate reporting: the presence of fossil fuels in a community.

How does coethnicity shape the reception and integration of these refugees? We examine the case of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities have substantial Pashtun ethnic membership. Using a survey with embedded conjoint and vignette experiments conducted among 3500 host citizens (of whom 2275 are Pashtun), we find that respondents significantly prefer Pashtun to non-Pashtun refugees. Additionally, compared to non-coethnics, coethnic Pashtun Pakistanis are more supportive of Afghan refugees and inclusive immigration policies. However, this preference is not uniform across coethnics – almost all of this coethnic solidarity is driven by Pashtuns living in districts outside of the Pashtun ethnic homeland province. We further find little evidence that appealing to shared ethnic ties affects Pashtun attitudes towards refugees. Qualitative interviews and focus groups support these findings. Ultimately, we cannot assume coethnic solidarity for refugees and migrants; this research contributes to our understanding of how local identity politics and geographic distribution shape refugee reception, highlighting the complex interplay between ethnic solidarity and territorial politics in conflict-affected regions.","Keywords: Coethnicity, conflict, displacement, refugee policy","Mashail Malik","Mashail Malik","Harvard University","Niloufer Siddiqui","University at Albany - SUNY","Yang-Yang Zhou","Dartmouth College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University","University at Albany - SUNY","Dartmouth College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I show that China’s technological statecraft aims to secure an advantage in interstate geoeconomic contestations, particularly in the context of the US-China great power rivalry. Theoretically, this paper argues that states’ technological statecraft is a product of the social interaction between states, and it challenges the predominant view of technologies in the existing IR scholarship as an ‘independent variable’ - exogenous to and determinist in (international) politics. It shows that technologies can be both the product of international politics and the material context where international politics takes place.This paper straddles the fields of STS and IR: it accounts for, through the case of China’s ‘New Infrastructure’, the input of global politics in the making of technologies. With topic modelling and semantic network analysis, this study analyses the co-occurrence of normative discourses and references to specific technologies in policy documents and technical standards, thus reconstructing why and how the Chinese state inscribes its foreign policy objectives into the materiality of technologies.This study contributes to a broader understanding of development of strategic technologies in institutional settings through the lens of foreign policy making. Its concept of technological statecraft offers another conceptualisation of industrial policy, which is so far mostly understood as a form of economic statecraft.","Keywords: STS, industrial policy, technological statecraft","Eric Zhang","Eric Zhang",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0087_1916_0396.html","Why Discriminate? The Logic of Targeting in Gaza's Aerial Occupation","Withdrawing its settlements and ground forces from Gaza in 2005, Israel continued to exercise its control by means of an aerial occupation. Over the past 19 years, this strategy produced alternating cycles of aerial bombardment. Despite their sheer magnitude, there is however remarkably little understanding of their variation and spatiality across multiple episodes. Our analysis combines spatial data on aerial attacks from all major military operations in Gaza, including 2008-2009, 2014, and 2023-2024 with geo-coded data on casualties and socio-economic indicators. We find that aerial violence intensified in scale, duration, lethality, and destruction, while simultaneously becoming more indiscriminate over time, in spite of advancing Israeli military technology.  Across episodes, we also identify a socio-economic targeting bias: selective casualties cluster in areas characterized by higher measures of wealth and education, while indicators of poverty show the opposite effect. Over time, however, this spatial pattern of selective violence also fades out. This leads us to discuss the changing nature of violence in Gaza in relation to common but insufficient theoretical explanations for resorting to selective or indiscriminate violence respectively.  Additionally, bombardment density varies as a function of topography and urban morphology, with sites located at higher altitudes or in more densely built-up areas being targeted more frequently. Despite the repeated wide-spread destruction and tens-of-thousands civilian casualties, we conclude that the aerial occupation of Gaza has failed, leading to a reverse towards a hybrid of aerial and terrestrial occupation as of October 2023.","Keywords: Aerial, Targeting, Selective, Indiscriminate, Gaza","Joshua Hellinger, Ravi Bhavnani","Joshua Hellinger","Geneva Graduate Institute Department of International Relations and Political Science"," Ravi Bhavnani","Geneva Graduate Institute Department of International Relations and Political Science","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Geneva Graduate Institute Department of International Relations and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0088_1757_0442.html","Level up Your Data: A Feasibility Study on Using Video Games for Data Collection in the Experimental Social Sciences","Video games have become a central part of contemporary popular culture. However, little research exists on the utilization of interactive video games for answering questions relevant for social scientists. This paper explores how video games can be designed and used for collecting behavioral data of participants in experimentally manipulated settings. Using RPG Maker, a commercial tool for creating video games, I designed a game in which participants control a character, talk to non-player characters, spend money, and make abstract decisions (e.g., voting). As a substantive test case, this paper answers the question how the trade-off between taxation and the quality of public services affect peoples' political solidarity. The video game was embedded in an online survey. Participants (N = 300, random sample of the German population) played as citizens of a fictional state, conducted everyday activities and thereby consumed various private and public goods. Within their fictional stay, they experienced changing levels of taxation and public service quality, resulting in more/less resources available for consuming private goods in exchange for a worse/better access to public services. Participants could then vote for a trade-off between taxes and public spending. Substantively, the preliminary results suggest a thermostatic mechanism, where people adjust their political solidarity according to their consumption quality of public and private goods. Methodologically, this study shows that using video games for data collections can generate high-quality behavioral data by making participants motivated, attentive, emotionally engaged, and giving them a strong agency.","Keywords: Gamification, Video Games, Survey Methodology, Behavioral Data, Redistribution","Philipp Kemper","Philipp Kemper",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University Duisburg-Essen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0089_2562_0472.html","Voter Surveillance and Political Polarization: Implications for Electoral Campaigns in the Digital Age","In recent years, political parties have developed sophisticated electoral campaigns that use large databases of personal information to identify people's political preferences. This raises questions about how having more information about the public's political affiliations affects parties' allocation of campaign resources during elections. Using a game-theoretic model, we explore how this impacts electoral competition between two parties, assuming they allocate resources strategically between mobilizing partisan supporters and persuading independent voters. We find that when parties have more accurate information about citizens' political affinities, they reduce resources allocated to persuading independent voters compared to mobilizing partisan supporters. This leads to a more polarized voting population during elections, especially with larger campaign budgets and fewer undecided voters. Additionally, increased political competition can reverse these effects, indicating that systems with fewer parties are more susceptible to such polarization results. This framework enhances our understanding of campaign communication and targeting strategies in the digital age, with institutional design implications for how limiting voter surveillance can reduce the polarization of the voting public.","Keywords: electoral competition, polarization, surveillance","Tiberiu Dragu","Tiberiu Dragu","New York University"," Xiaochen Fan","New York University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing literature has primarily focused on external factors such as party interests, international pressure, and advocacy by interest groups. We offer a complementary, yet overlooked, explanation centered on the career ambitions of individual legislators. We argue that in chambers where legislators anticipate shorter parliamentary tenures, a gender quota may not threaten men's mid- or long-term career prospects, making them less opposed to quota adoption. We develop a theoretical model linking legislators' career expectations to their incentives to block or delay gender quotas, predicting that quotas are more likely to be adopted in legislatures with shorter career tenures. We test this theory using Event History Analysis with an original dataset on sixteen Latin American lower chambers from 1988 onward, using reelection rates as a proxy for career patterns. Consistent with our predictions, our results show that gender quotas are adopted more quickly in legislatures with lower reelection rates. These findings underscore the strategic considerations behind gender quota adoption and the potential obstacles posed by male legislators' ambitions to women's political inclusion.","Keywords: Gender Quotas; Electoral Systems; Women's Representation; Political Careers; Legislatures;","Gonzalo Di Landro","Agustín Vallejo","Hobby School of Public Affairs, University of Houston","Gonzalo Di Landro","Rice University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hobby School of Public Affairs, University of Houston","Rice University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this thesis is to describe the instrumentalization of migration by third countries such as Belarus and Russia, which use migrants to exert political pressure on the EU. The case study of Poland and Finland allows for a comparison of two different approaches in terms of border management policies. In Poland, in response to the influx of migrants, strict border protection measures were introduced. Finland otherwise introduced enhanced cooperation mechanisms with NATO and Frontex to better counter the migration crisis. Both countries have recognized that migration can be used to disrupt internal stability, which is related to the hybrid threats. The actions targeting weaker points in the security system of states that are difficult to neutralize by conventional means as a combination of migratory pressures with other elements, such as disinformation, cyberattacks on public institutions, and attempts to create social tensions in destination countries, challenged EU security. The case study of Poland and Finland reveals differences in approaches to border protection and international cooperation. Poland, focusing on physical border protection, while Finland has focused on legislative and operational management of migration in the face of hybrid threats.

To account for noncompliance and inattention, researchers frequently include post-treatment manipulation or attention checks in their survey experiments. Unfortunately, current methods assume that compliance and attention can be measured without error. In reality, inattentive and noncompliant respondents are particularly prone to measurement errors, leading to biased causal effect estimates. In this paper, I develop a numerical method for sharply bounding causal effects with noisy measures of compliance or attention. To account for sampling variability, I also construct confidence intervals that achieve their nominal asymptotic coverage under a mild differentiability condition. I demonstrate the wide applicability of these methods using recent studies aimed at reducing attitudinal support for political violence.","Keywords: survey experiments, causal inference, partial identification, manipulation checks, attention checks","Matthew Tyler","Matthew Tyler",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Rice University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on 148,764 written questions submitted to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan between 1999 and 2019, this paper examines how the electoral reform from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single member district mixed-member majoritarian (SMD-MMM) affected legislators' incentives to pursue particularistic benefits for their constituencies. To evaluate the impact of this electoral reform, I employed regression analysis controlling for district and legislator attributes, alongside state-of-the-art transformer architectures fine-tuned with pork barrel-annotated legislation. The findings reveal that the electoral reform had complex effects on legislators' asking of pork barrel questions during ministerial oversight. While the overall likelihood of pork barrel questions decreased under SMD compared to SNTV, the effects varied substantially across district-level socioeconomic conditions. Specifically, legislators from districts with higher population density, income levels, and unemployment rates show stronger tendencies toward pursuing particularistic benefits, reflecting intensified electoral accountability pressure under the SMD system compared to SNTV.","Keywords: Electoral systems, parliamentary questions,  single non-transferable vote (SNTV), single member district mixed-member majoritarian (SMD-MMM)","Yen-Chieh Liao","Yen-Chieh Liao",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0094_2703_0593.html","Matched or Mismatched? Polarization and Voting at the Local Level","In the US, the larger culture wars can closely mirror the partisan polarization between Democrats and Republicans (or liberals and conservatives). Discussions at the school district level about curricula and textbooks can reflect national partisan divisions, with real-world ramifications for teachers, students, and communities. These polarized debates may resonate most strongly in school districts with different partisan leanings than their surrounding state environments (e.g., Democratic districts in Republican states). In these mismatched partisan environments, partisan polarization may energize civic engagement.In our study, we argue that in these mismatched partisan environments, polarization may energize political participation at the local level. How do voters react when they believe their values are being challenged or ignored? We argue that voter turnout in those districts will increase, as those who can vote will be more likely to do so. Elections for school boards traditionally attract very low turnout, but mismatched school districts may be ground zero for partisan debates over polarized issues.To conduct this investigation, we use information on voter participation in school board elections, available in voter file records to which we have access from Murmuration Research Institute, Inc., as well as census data.","Keywords: vote turnout, polarization, US, partisanship","Christine Lipsmeyer","Andrea Junqueira","Arkansas State University","Christine Lipsmeyer","Texas A&M University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arkansas State University","Texas A&M University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bringing political culture to bear on this puzzle, we ask how normative commitment to democracy among voters and parties alike shapes these dynamics. Our approach explicitly integrates both the demand- and supply-side dimensions. In a vignette experiment conducted among Czech respondents, we explore which kinds of political parties are more likely to retain voter support when proposing democratic transgressions as well as which kinds of voters are more easily swayed by elites to tolerate such transgressions. Our findings indicate that voter commitment to liberal democracy plays a greater role than party positions on democracy: on average, voters with high commitment to liberal democracy judge transgressions more harshly than the supporters of parties highly commited to liberal democracy. Even when the in-party justifies a proposed transgression, it is still unable to flip voters’ assessment of the democratic nature of a proposal. These results shed light on the sources of democratic resilience and the importance of factoring citizens’ level of democratic commitment in when assessing the trade-offs they may be willing to make in the face of co-partisan democratic transgressions.","Keywords: democratic backsliding; democratic commitment; political parties; voters; vignette experiment","Natasha Wunsch","Natasha Wunsch","University of Fribourg","Tsveta Petrova","Columbia University","Joep van Lit","Radboud University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Fribourg","Columbia University","Radboud University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explore how election to political office impacts fertility decisions, using data from over 161,000 candidates who ran in local council elections in Finland between the years 1996 and 2008. By employing a regression discontinuity design that compares candidates who narrowly won to those who narrowly lost, we identify the causal effect of being elected on subsequent fertility outcomes. We find that women elected to office are significantly less likely to have children during their term compared to non-elected women, while we do not observe such effect for men. This fertility reduction is particularly pronounced in larger municipalities, where the demands of political office may be greater. Our findings suggest that political office may impose gendered costs, potentially contributing to the under-representation of women in politics and shaping broader life choices.","Keywords: Fertility, Local elections, Political office, Regression discontinuity design","Janne Tukiainen","Jaakko Meriläinen","Stockholm School of Economics","Tuukka Saarimaa","Aalto University","Dawn Teele","Johns Hopkins University","Janne Tukiainen","University of Turku","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stockholm School of Economics","Aalto University","Johns Hopkins University","University of Turku",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we investigate when and why women’s careers stagnate using comprehensive data on personnel records on all civil servants employed in the Danish ministerial bureaucracy from 1999 through 2019. We show that women’s careers stagnate at the earliest possible stage: a lower proportion of women ever enter into the lowest level of management, and when they do, they do so at a higher age than men. This exacerbates gender imbalance at all higher levels of management. Next, we use a difference-in-differences design to show that women’s probability of entering the lowest level of management drops significantly compared to men, when they get a man as the leader of their unit. The arrival of a woman as the unit leader does not have a similar positive effect. Further heterogeneity analyses show that the negative effect on women’s careers is concentrated among women younger than 45 years of age and in units where there is a high proportion of women managers. Having a woman as the minister only suppresses the effect at higher levels of management.

Experimental Evidence from Switzerland","Mitigating climate change requires significant shifts away from greenhouse gas-intensive consumption patterns and lifestyles. Both voluntary individual behavioral change and government action are needed to reduce household emissions sufficiently. However, the relationship between individual action and support for climate policy remains contested. While some argue that individual pro-environmental actions increase support for related policies, others suggest that these actions decrease support by reducing the perceived need for government intervention and serving as a moral licensing strategy.We contribute to this literature by employing an experimental design among a representative sample of the Swiss resident population (n=3457) that causally assesses how the willingness to engage in specific emission reduction strategies influences climate policy support. Using a novel elicitation tool that allows respondents to make realistic trade-offs between different types of pro-environmental behavior, we assess how the choice of specific emission reduction strategies subsequently influences policy support. This experimental design allows for a more valid assessment of pro-environmental behavioral choices than previous studies. In addition, we assess which individual-level characteristics are associated with an increase in policy support subsequent to the choice task and for whom the treatment may backfire, leading to negative spillovers.Our results will provide insights into the dynamics between individual actions and policy support, offering guidance for designing interventions that complement behavioral preferences while fostering broader acceptance of effective climate policies.","Keywords: climate policy, public opinion, pro-environmental behavior, spillover, survey experiment","Florian Lichtin","Florian Lichtin","ETH Zurich"," E.

By fine-tuning a domain-specific BERT model with a named entity recognition head to map actor involvement in EU legal texts, this approach bridges the gap between manual policy analysis and coarse representations of legislative text, offering a scalable yet nuanced framework for automated policy annotation.Second, applying the trained model to a corpus of more than 3,000 EU legislative texts nested in more than 1,000 legislative procedures, the paper investigates the evolution of policy design throughout the legislative process. Comparing initial European Commission proposals with final texts adopted by the European Parliament and Council reveals significant variations in actor involvement and other policy features, highlighting the dynamic, multi-institutional nature of EU policymaking.Third, the paper investigates possible covariates of changes in policy design over the legislative process, focusing on the institutional and procedural factors frequently associated with shifts in policy outcomes.By leveraging and adapting pre-existing models and an annotated dataset, this study provides novel tools, data, and empirical insights for addressing both existing and emerging questions in the field of EU decision-making and legislative politics, that can help us understand power and legislative outcomes in the EU.

"abstract_0101_1908_0790.html","The Climate is Changing: How Energy Politics Transform Environmental Party Competition","Comparative politics has traditionally viewed environmental issues as valence topics, universally supported to varying degrees. However, recent research challenges this notion, suggesting that parties adopt distinct positions on climate change mitigation. Why has the environmental debate become positional? This study argues that parties take clear stances on environmental issues when energy dominates the political agenda. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain this shift: the broad relevance of energy to multiple stakeholders and its connection to decarbonization. Energy’s centrality engages a significant portion of the population concerned about energy access and affordability. Additionally, decarbonization policies bring severe domestic distributional consequences, prompting parties to address the topic strategically. As energy dominates climate discussions, it creates opportunities for parties to mobilize voters. Parties’ positions depend on whether a pro- or anti-environmental strategy helps attract new supporters while maintaining existing voter alignments. This theoretical argument is tested using party manifestos from 24 European countries (1980–2023). I offer two pieces of evidence. First, I descriptively confirm that parties’ attention to energy issue has increased over time and has dominated the climate debate. Second, I use a novel measure of parties’ environmental positions, based on their manifestos, and show that parties’ positions polarize as energy issues dominate the political debate. These findings have significant implications for understanding party competition, demonstrating that debates over environmental issues are dynamic rather than static. The evolution of climate issues, particularly the centrality of energy, fundamentally shapes how parties position themselves, influencing the trajectory of environmental policy and voter alignment.","Keywords: party competition, party positions, energy politics, environmental issues","Dafni Kalatzi Pantera","Dafni Kalatzi Pantera",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a comprehensive conjoint experiment, the authors assess whether members prioritise democratic decision-making, even if it risks electoral outcomes, or favour maximising electoral chances at the expense of internal democracy. Surveying members from the Conservative and Labour parties in England, participants were presented with hypothetical party profiles featuring attributes such as leadership selection, policy determination, candidate nomination, and digitalisation. By randomly varying these attributes, the conjoint experiment isolates the effect of each decision-making component, providing a nuanced view of members’ attitudes towards party decision-making. The survey concludes with a targeted question on the democracy-versus-efficiency trade-off, analysed alongside conjoint results and sample demographics, including members’ seniority, age, gender, and party engagement levels. This research fills a significant gap in the party politics literature, offering empirical insights into members’ perspectives on their influence within parties. This is especially relevant given the growing demands for democratic renewal in democracies facing a crisis of representation. By examining members’ preferences for democratic versus efficiency-oriented decision-making, this study illuminates the potential tensions within party organisation concerning representativeness and responsiveness, contributing to broader discussions on revitalising political parties.","Keywords: Intra-party decision-making, Democratic trade-off, Conjoint experiment, Party members, Party organisation","Marco Meloni","Marco Meloni","University of Southampton"," Paolo Spada","University of Southampton","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Southampton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in February 2022 has heightened the EU’s need to diversify its strategic resources and partners. As part of its de-risking strategy, the EU has focused on strengthening diplomatic ties far beyond its traditional geopolitical sphere, including the Indo-Pacific region. This study applies selected text-as-data content analysis methods to statements made by the European Commission, the primary actor in negotiating trade agreements with third countries, directed at Indonesia. Utilizing related press releases, statements, and speeches from the first von der Leyen Commission (2019–2024) and the analytical software MAXQDA, this research examines whether and how significantly the Commission’s stance toward Indonesia evolved as a result of Russia’s aggression. The paper argues that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission reassessed its existing disputes with Indonesia. Subsequently, the rhetoric of its senior representatives became less critical of the Southeast Asian nation, reflecting a growing awareness of the importance of diversifying strategic partnerships. Such a conclusion would undoubtedly testify to the diplomatic acumen of the EU’s senior officials. However, it would also represent a significant relativization of the EU’s efforts to assert its interests in trade agreement negotiations, potentially carrying adverse implications for the Union’s future external relations.","Keywords: European Union, Indonesia, Strategic diversification, Russia-Ukraine conflict, Diplomatic relations, Communication","David Broul, Antonín Nenutil","David Broul","Palacký University Olomouc"," Antonín Nenutil","Palacký University Olomouc","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Palacký University Olomouc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we study voter support---or punishment---of candidates involved in different types of political malfeasance. Unlike conventional corruption voting studies, we focus not just on the candidate election stage, but also on voters' normative beliefs about how the party leadership should respond to candidates implicated in acts of corruption. To this end, we marshal evidence from a conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey collected in Denmark---a low-corruption context with a relatively weak regulatory environment for money in politics. Our experiment varies candidate wrong-doing from small and seemingly insignificant acts to more severe forms of corrupt behaviors. We analyze multiple outcomes related to candidate evaluation, voters' willingness to tolerate candidates involved in different kinds of wrong-doing, as well as how voters believe political parties should respond when their candidates are (alleged to be) involved in malfeasance. Our paper expands upon existing work on corruption voting by showing that voter responses matter not just for implicated candidates but also for affiliated parties, since voters also hold distinct normative beliefs and expectations on how the leadership of political parties should respond to corruption within their ranks. In this way, democratic accountability operates not just on election day, but also in-between elections through public pressure on party leadership to handle cases of corruption in a normatively appropriate way.","Keywords: Corruption voting, money in politics, accountability, survey experiment, Denmark","Zoltan Fazekas","Zoltan Fazekas","Copenhagen Business School"," Mogens K Justesen","Copenhagen Business School","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Copenhagen Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0105_1852_1336.html","Pride & Prejudice: Impact of National Days on Patriotism and Attitudes Toward Immigrants","Patriotism, an individual sense of pride to belong to a country, is often considered by states important to secure citizen support. This feeling may go beyond national allegiance and shape perceptions of out-group members. While past research has studied the interconnectedness of state-sponsored patriotism, national identification, and citizens' attitudes toward immigrants, robust empirical evidence on how such factors are related remains scarce. This paper explores the mechanism through which states foster patriotism and how this, in turn, influences attitudes towards immigrants. We focus on the impact of state-sponsored patriotism through national day celebrations. To this end, we assemble a global dataset of publicly available surveys consisting of 1.8 million observations from 1985-2023. Employing an event study design to evaluate the effect of national days on patriotism, we measure exposure to the national day as the temporal difference between survey dates and these celebrations. Our analysis demonstrates that leading up to the national day, citizens feel less patriotic and remain so a few days after. This trend returns to pre-national day levels within two weeks following the event. This negative result is driven by countries with higher ethnic fractionalisation. We argue that people in more diverse societies resist submitting to the state’s national identity narrative accentuated by the national day. Instead, people unite in diversity. To substantiate this argument, we show that people in ethnically more diverse countries report more positive attitudes towards immigrants after the national day.

However, the leading task-based model of automation does not consider unions, and recent studies tend to focus on estimating average effects. We argue that the relationship between robotization and organized labor is heterogeneous. We integrate tasks and automation into a model of collective bargaining and worker mobilization. Our model illustrates that the impact of robots on unions does not reduce to a race of job displacement vs. productivity gains. Empirically, we use quantile instrumental variable regression and find that the impact of robotization on unionization significantly varies across 722 regional labor markets in the US.  To explore mechanisms, we turn to a survey experiment that enables us to estimate whether beliefs about worker mobilization are sensitive to the bargaining environment.","Keywords: automation, unions, organized labor, wage bargaining","Michael Becher, Daniel Stegmueller","Michael Becher","IE University","Daniel Stegmueller","Duke University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IE University","Duke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0108_2444_0125.html","Ethno-political Cleavages and Autocratic Purges: How Autocrats Navigate Political Threats","How do autocrats mitigate the threat of opposition within their governments? While rulers can alienate rivals by expelling them from the governing coalition, this strategy can trigger further instability. Existing research indicates that rulers strategically target their most threatening rivals. The literature identifies non-partisan and non-coethnics as significant threats to the regime. However, the absence of organized opposition parties or ethnic opposition in repressive autocratic regimes does not imply a lack of political threats. I contribute to the existing literature by arguing that political cleavages emerging from previous periods of political mobilization pose an enduring political threat to autocratic rulers. The empirical analysis focuses on former French Sub-Saharan African colonies, where one-party rule followed a brief electoral competition period before independence. I show that ethno-political cleavages, which became politically salient during colonial elections, affected the vulnerability of post-colonial ministers to purges. Due to the high risks involved in purging, I expect rulers to target historically mobilized non-coethnics at points in their rule where the cost of inaction and the ruler's strength are high, such as following an unsuccessful coup. The analysis relies on newly collected data on political mobilization during late-colonial elections and individual-level data on post-colonial ministers between 1966 and 2016. Using a difference-in-difference design, I show that ministers from ethnic groups that mobilized politically at decolonization faced an increased risk of being purged following unsuccessful coup attempts. The results indicate the long-lasting nature of ethno-political cleavages that became salient during late colonial elections.","Keywords: Purges, ethnic politics, colonial legacies, decolonization, authoritarianism","Maria Murias Munoz","Maria Murias Munoz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0109_2295_0223.html","Local participation in the global economy: How regional trade integration affects citizens’ preferences on cultural issues","The emergence of a social cleavage between universalism and particularism has often been attributed to structural change and individuals’ economic grievances stemming from globalisation. Most literature has emphasised the backlash effects of specific trade shocks in areas with historically strong manufacturing sectors. This article builds on this literature by highlighting the role of integration in global value chains as a core antecedent of public opinion on cultural issues. We employ firm-level microdata from the UK ONS Annual Business Survey, which allow us to measure the share of importers and exporters of goods and services among businesses in each UK parliamentary constituency (2014-2023). We match that data with individual-level data from the British Election Study panel survey to test through which mechanisms globalisation affects cultural preferences in regions with different sectoral specialisations and different levels of success in the open economy. We hypothesize that greater participation of local businesses in the global economy is associated with more favorable views toward immigration, but that this effect is stronger for sectors that are a particular source of local pride, such as manufacturing, compared to other sectors that do not generate such widespread identification, such as service industries. Moreover, we expect the share of exporters among local businesses to be more strongly associated with citizens’ cultural preferences than the share of importers. Our empirical tests support our intuitions. Our findings have implications for the study of social cleavages and the role of economic structure in preference formation on cultural issues.","Keywords: trade, culture, public opinion, firm data, UK","Sofia Vasilopoulou","Kira Gartzou-Katsouyanni","University of Oxford","Philip Schnattinger","Bank of England","Sofia Vasilopoulou","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","King's College London","University of Oxford","Bank of England",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explore a novel theoretical framework positing that violence against environmental defenders increases before elections. Unlike typical election-related violence, we suggest that this violence is not directly geared toward influencing election outcomes. During high-profile events such as national elections, media coverage is heavily skewed towards these events, creating a media vacuum on local issues that can be exploited by actors wishing to perpetrate violence with minimal scrutiny.By extending this logic, we hypothesize that other high-distraction events, like the World Cup, create similar opportunities for violence due to the temporary diversion of media and public attention. Using a global dataset on land and environmental activist murders and statistical analysis, we empirically test this hypothesis. Our findings reveal that instances of violence against environmental defenders not only spike during electoral periods but also during other high-distraction events in the media, such as the World Cup. Our framework emphasizes the role of media distraction in facilitating violence against vulnerable groups.","Keywords: environmentalists, violence, global south, fdi, corruption","Melanie Sauter, Anthony Calacino","Melanie Sauter","University of Mannheim","Anthony Calacino","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Mannheim","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A core finding in the contentious politics literature traces this difficulty to the polarization and fragmentation that emerges in revolutionary moments. Less is known, however, about cases where opposition movements overcome these challenges and mount successful electoral challenges to incumbent regimes. This paper explores the sources of this success in Lebanon, where the 2019 October Uprising resulted in the emergence of new, electorally successful opposition movements with roots in the protests themselves. Using a mixed-methods approach, we show how the uprising shaped subsequent patterns of political participation and electoral behavior in the 2022 legislative election. A difference-in-differences design shows that support for opposition-aligned lists doubled and support for incumbent candidates decreased by 50% in municipalities that experienced at least one protest. Further statistical tests and elite interviews suggest that these dynamics were driven by the adoption of explicitly anti-sectarian messaging and abstention from more violent, disruptive tactics. These findings illuminate how identity-based movements can successfully transition from street politics to electoral participation, offering insights into pathways for political change in deeply divided societies.","Keywords: Elections; protests; quantitative; political behavior","Daniel Tavana","Daniel Tavana","Penn State","Christiana Parreira","Geneva Graduate Institute","Lindsay Walsh","Penn State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geneva Graduate Institute","Penn State",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context understanding Russian strategic culture, particularly as articulated through presidential communication, contributes to deep exploration of geopolitical dynamics and challenging nature of European integration. This paper examines the evolution of Russian strategic culture through the analysis of Russian presidential speeches from 1999 to 2023, showing how they underpin Russia's impetus to maintain influence over its perceived historical territories and assert its great power status. Using a mixed-methods approach to the analysis of the selected Russian presidential speeches, this study demonstrates how the respective communications perpetuate the discourse of Russia's claim to spheres of influence and its idiosyncratic role in global affairs, showing the recurrence, evolution, and intertwining of themes such as national pride, security, and anti-Westernism over time, while also identifying shifts in Russia's strategic priorities, particularly towards its immediate neighborhood. By foregrounding the role of presidential communication, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of Russia's strategic culture discourse patterns, including the state’s perception of European integration through the prism of a growing anti-Westernism that not only leads to the destabilization of its neighbors, but also challenges the very boundaries of the European integration project, raising questions about the future of regional polity-formation in Europe.","Keywords: Strategic culture, strategic priorities, presidential communication, discourse patterns","Iryna Lukianova","Iryna Lukianova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UZH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I add to existing explanations -- which primarily characterize uneven state enforcement as benevolent -- by detailing how states may rely on a logic of non-enforcement which is primarily coercive. In particular, I suggest that selective enforcement of its own policies allows states to aid third-party allies in their exploitation of law-breaking populations. I illustrate this logic in the case of Lagos, Nigeria which recently began enforcement on a ban of the state's popular and omnipresent motorcycle taxis. I exploit a unique feature of the governor's enforcement announcement, which delineated where the government intended to actively enforce. I show --  using observational evidence from several months of fieldwork and local newspaper archives; as well as original geo-coded datasets of enforcement locations, exploitation points, traffic incidents, and informal transport density -- how the state's decision to pass, but incompletely enforce, a ban on informal transit in Lagos was made in order to aid the exploitation of transport operators by powerful transport unions, on which the Lagos state government relies for electoral violence. In particular, I show that the political geography of the ban's enforcement serves to displace riders into areas controlled by the union; and exploit the timing of a surprising election result to show how a shock to state reliance on the union is followed by a change in enforcement patterns.","Keywords: West Africa; Repression; Political Violence; Conflict; Informality","Melissa Pavlik","Melissa Pavlik",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Candidate Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines how incumbency strengthens kinship networks within local political institutions, using data from municipal council elections in Turkey. Our regression discontinuity design reveals that incumbency significantly enhances the role of family networks, particularly in regions with lower educational attainment. Drawing on data from an expansive survey of candidates and households, we find that education plays a key role in weakening the grip of kinship politics, as it shapes political self-efficacy and aspirations differently for those within and outside kinship networks. This divergence limits the pool of non-kinship candidates in less educated areas, perpetuating a cycle of poor governance. Our findings highlight the critical role of education in disrupting this cycle, contributing to discussions on political dynasties and modernization.","Keywords: local politics; urban politics; governance; accountability","Tugba Bozcaga","Tugba Bozcaga",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One response by European countries has been to make significant investments in information campaigns designed to discourage irregular departures toward Europe, although the evidence base for these kinds of interventions remains limited. There is in particular virtually no evidence from randomized controlled trials with representative population samples and actual migration as an outcome. We contribute such a study in this paper, analyzing a field experiment we implemented from 2020 to 2023 with 3,200 households in Edo and Delta states in Nigeria, a hotspot of irregular international migration. Treated households received detailed, accurate information about features of the journey along the ""Mediterranean route"". We estimate effects of this information on beliefs about migration-related risks, interest in attempting irregular migration, and actual migration from treated households. We find significant effects on beliefs and migration intent, in line with the logic of the intervention. We also find that small effects on international migration are surpassed by the intervention’s negative effect on domestic migration, and we discuss implications of this finding for policy.","Keywords: irregular migration, information campaign, field experiment, Nigeria","Alexandra Scacco","Alexandra Scacco","WZB Berlin Social Science Center; University of Hamburg","Bernd Beber","RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research","Macartan Humphreys","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Dean Yang","University of Michigan","","","","","","","","","","","","","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","University of Hamburg","RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research","University of Michigan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0117_1331_0989.html","The Diversity Illusion? Explaining Resistance to Inclusive Representation in Brazil","Why do parties continue to nominate overwhelmingly white male candidate lists? Over recent decades, attitudes about gender and racial equality have become more egalitarian across many democracies. Yet, the political representation of historically marginalized groups continues to lag behind, even in countries which have adopted institutions like quotas for women and ethnic minorities. We argue that one reason homogeneous candidate lists persist is that parties – even those on the left – respond to political conservatism in the electorate. That is, even as voters have grown less sexist, racist, and homophobic over time, their political views have tilted right and far-right over the same period. In this context, parties might be unwilling to diversify, given diverse lists are associated with more progressive politics (e.g, Adams et al. ND). To test our argument, we leverage official candidate data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024  municipal elections in Brazil. Brazil offers a compelling case: it has an incredibly ethnically diverse population, the state has legislated quotas and reserved campaign funds for historically marginalized groups, and voters largely support these efforts. Yet, white men still dominate candidate lists. Importantly, the data we employ include rare self-reported information about all candidates’ sex and race/ethnicity. We test theories about the conditions under which lists remain homogeneous by matching this information with party- and municipal-level data. The findings have important implications for the conditions under which inclusive representation can be achieved in democracies.","Keywords: Political representation, gender and politics, intersectionality, conservatism, Brazil","Malu Gatto","Jorge Fernandes","Institute of Public Goods, CSIC","Malu Gatto","University College London","Ana Catalano Weeks","University of Bath","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Public Goods, CSIC","University College London","University of Bath",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While prior research highlights the role of gender stereotypes in shaping perceptions of politicians' competence across policy domains, less is known about how politicians’ gender drives voters' curiosity and engagement with political information. This paper addresses this gap, leveraging observational clickstream data from a Voting Advice Application and experimental evidence to analyze how politicians’ gender influences voters' information-seeking patterns. Our findings reveal notable gender dynamics. While male voters appear motivated by uncertainty, seeking information about less likely female candidates, female voters focus their searches on female candidates. Moreover, we find that the gender of voters affects not only the volume but also the type of information sought about male and female politicians. These results deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between politicians and voters' gender and its consequence on political information voters seek to make voting decisions during electoral campaigns.","Keywords: Gender, Politicians, information-seeking, clickstream-data, experiment","Maxime Walder","Maxime Walder","University of Geneva; University of Basel","Nathalie Giger","University of Geneva","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Geneva","University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three cases of non-compliance exemplify discrepancies in the application of EU law in Norway, despite Norway’s obligation to fully comply. In these cases, the Norwegian legal framework granted a level of discretion to government agencies that exceeds what is permitted under EU law. To explore why non-compliance happened, the article draws on a large-N survey data and interviews with senior bureaucrats from 2023 and a document analysis. The research assesses the role of discretion, identifying which discretionary approach, whether driven by political responsiveness or legal coherence, is more likely to result in non-compliance. Results show that the discretionary approach used to address complexity is justified and framed within a technocratic regime. Norwegian bureaucrats exhibit a technocratic ethos, justifying their discretionary practices through reference to democratic considerations, and reflecting a commitment to national priorities.","Keywords: Administrative discretion, European Union law, mixed-method, political responsiveness, public administration.","Alicia Noëllie Saes-Louarn","Alicia Noëllie Saes-Louarn",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ARENA, Centre for European Studies, University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This framework uses the relative information entropy instead of the traditional Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property (MLRP) and simplifies incentive analysis for scenarios where signal precision varies between actions. The findings reveal that the agent's incentive to undertake costly actions is U-shaped in the variance of one signal distribution. This implies that increasing precision in one area can compensate for lower precision in another, but enhancing the less precise signal may reduce incentives.

Nonetheless, scholarship in this area, especially in the context of south-south migration in Latin America, has yet to test this proposition directly. In general, scholars use education as a proxy for labor market skills, testing whether unqualified workers drive xenophobic attitudes. We claim this approach could be insufficient, as we do not know whether low-skilled workers are directly affected by immigrant workers. We argue that informal native workers in the Global South can feel more strongly the labor market competition from migrants because their jobs are less secure and they might not be eligible for any welfare program if they were to lose their source of income. In this article, instead of using education, we use primary data to measure informality in the labor market in Colombia, using a battery of indicators. Then, using a conjoint experiment, we test whether informal workers hold more adversarial attitudes toward immigrants compared to workers in the formal sector.","Keywords: immigration attitudes, informality, labor market competition, Latin America","Miguel Carreras","Miguel Carreras","University of California, Riverside","Pablo Argote","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Riverside","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By taking advantage of the vastly different expansion of the vote across geographical space, I find that the overall tax burden for the most part is unaffected by expanding the voter population. However, the types of taxes collected are impacted: income tax rates increase, while wealth and property tax rates exhibit less clear patterns.

While existing research identifies appointment to senior government positions as a mechanism of elite co-optation, we know comparatively less about the strategies autocrats use to ensure appointees’ long-run loyalty. I study one strategy that allows autocrats to maintain loyalty, the shuffling of officials across positions and regions. My argument highlights how, in a ‘co-optation shuffle’, elite rotation aims to sustain credible co-optation and to promote elites’ upward mobility, often at the expense of good governance. Officials are moved to prevent network building and policy stagnation. This contrasts with a ‘performance shuffling’ strategy, where appointments prioritise competence and good performance. To explore these dynamics, I study the career trajectories of Kazakhstan’s appointed regional governors (akims). Collecting unusually detailed biographical data that span 25 years (from 1997 to 2022), I present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of governor’s time in each office and career trajectories. My findings reveal a dynamic system of rotation focused on credible co-optation.

Yet once in office, we make the argument that governments also might face motivations for presenting a non-specific agenda. We argue that there are institutional veto player and commitment mechanisms (such as coalition majority status, a coalition agreement, and government ideological division) that might lead governments to insert blurred statements of their priorities. We evaluate the effects of these variables based on a hand-coding of the socio-economic content of government declarations from 13 Western European countries from 1979 to 2017. These declarations lay out the priorities that a new government will seek to address in the coming years. First we discuss descriptively the number of statements that are specific in government intentions (such as rising corporate tax rate by 3%) versus those that provide greater room for the government to later maneuver (such as promising to reform corporate taxation rates). We find that governments with ideological divisions tend to be more specific in their declarations, while minority governments tend towards less specificity in their declarations. Our conclusions expand the idea of position blurring or fuzziness from the party level to the government level.","Keywords: government declarations, veto players, government agendas, position blurring, policy agenda","Matthew Bergman","Hanna Bäck","Lund University","Wolfgang Müller","University of Vienna","Matthew Bergman","Corvinus University of Budapest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lund University","University of Vienna","Corvinus University of Budapest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I study this question using a randomized evaluation in the context of water preservation in Jordan. Water preservation is crucial in the face of rising scarcity, yet it is challenging to change behaviors. In an experiment involving women attending religious classes, those in treated classes receive messaging on the sanctity of water in Islam, while the others attend classes on an unrelated religious topic. The treatment fosters prosocial attitudes and conservation efforts regarding water resources. Relative to the control, treated women were 28% more likely to donate to a water charity. More importantly, after three months, they reduced objectively measured water consumption by 17%. Exploring mechanisms, the messages work by instilling religious beliefs about water, especially those firmly rooted in the religious canon. In contrast, I observe a backlash against new practices that have been recently accepted by religious scholars but are not grounded in the tradition.

"abstract_0126_0364_0551.html","The Link between Integration and Political Trust among German Citizens with Migrant Backgrounds.","While previous studies indicate that immigrants have higher levels of political trust than natives, political trust decreases with time spent in the host country, eventually converging with the trust levels of natives (Adman & Strömblad, 2013). This decrease in trust is often attributed to immigrants integrating into the host society and becoming more similar to natives, suggesting that integration is corrosive to political trust (Michelson, 2003). In this study, I examine immigrant citizens in Germany and investigate the influence of integration on their political trust, arguing that the influence of integration into the host country and its facets, such as economic or social integration, need to be examined more closely. I systematically compare different facets of integration and their influence on political trust. These are economic (e.g., income), cognitive/identificatory (e.g. language proficiency), and social integration (e.g., native partners). To analyze the relationship between integration and political trust among immigrants, I use data on German citizens with Turkish and Soviet backgrounds from the 2017 Immigrant German Election Study, comparing 1st-, 1.5th-, and 2nd-generation immigrants and the influences of integration on their political trust. Overall, my results indicate no corrosive effect of integration on political trust. Instead different facets, particularly cognitive/identificatory integration, are positively associated with political trust for 1st-generation immigrants. Meanwhile, integration appears to have less influence on political trust for other immigrant generations. This implies integration, rather than harming political trust, promotes political trust for 1st-generation immigrants while having less of an association with trust for 1.5th- and 2nd-generation immigrants.","Keywords: Political Trust, Integration, Quantitative Methods","Jessica Kuhlmann","Jessica Kuhlmann",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Siegen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0127_1132_0229.html","Who Wins and Who Loses? How Human Capital Concentration Shapes the Economic and Political Effects of the Green Transition","What is the role of local communities in determining the winners and losers of the green transition? Some communities are more exposed to the effects of the transition compared with others due to the presence of firms / sectors vulnerable to decarbonization policies. While it is often assumed that all ‘transition-exposed’ communities bear economic costs, I contend that some also stand to benefit economically. Benefitting requires firms and workers to leverage new investments and opportunities arising from the transition. Thus, I argue that the local concentration of human capital – the skills and knowledge within a community – is a key determinant of which communities emerge as the economic 'winners' or 'losers' of the transition.  This economic divide shapes local attitudes: residents in 'losing' communities oppose the transition, while this effect dissipates in 'winning' communities. These attitudes extend beyond those directly affected by the transition, indicating a ‘sociotropic’ mechanism. I test this argument in the UK, leveraging local-authority level economic and census data, as well as individual-level panel data.  Using difference-in-differences and event study designs, I demonstrate that since the 2008 Climate Change Act was introduced, communities with lower (higher) levels of human capital have seen a decline (improvement) in the economic performance of transition-exposed sectors. Then, by merging contextual-level indicators with individual-level data, I show that residents in ‘losing’ areas display opposition to the transition, while this effect is mitigated in ‘winning’ areas. These findings highlight the need for carefully targeted transition assistance and investment policies.","Keywords: Green-Transition; Human-Capital; Economy; Community; Sociotropic","Max Bradley","Max Bradley",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Occurring at the peak of concerns regarding climate change, those seemed to combine ethical but also —as it was argued— practical considerations. Discourse about such strategies have not disappeared but certainly seem to have now been drown out by other concerns, specifically those related to the capabilities and requirements of actually waging high intensity wars due to a troubled geopolitical context. An exploration of one specific tenant of those plans, namely the introduction of electric vehicles in large numbers seems particularly relevant. The ever-increasing energy demands of various military system does indeed seem to be sitting at the crossroad when it comes to combine operational requirements and more political motivations. An interview conducted with the highest authority of the Belgian military’s acquisition department done in August 2022 —which already seemed extremely pessimistic— and more recent realities will be used as a basis for this approach. Our findings are that a vast dichotomy between public discourse and the actual reality of the electrification of the fleets in terms of feasibility, potential positive outcomes in terms of warfighting capabilities but also outright desirability are present. These issues are linked not only to the military but also to broader challenges specific to electric vehicles and a tendency for political rather than practical decision-making, even regarding the military.","Keywords: Electric vehicles, Energy transition, Greenification, Military acquisitions, Warfare","Samuel Vinck","Samuel Vinck",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Phd candidate at National Chengchi University, Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Second, as a means of upholding their commitments to international human rights laws. Unlawful repression could trigger backlash from an international audience. Third, as a shield to sustain their democratic credentials while being able to use force with impunity. Laws can serve as a signal of a deliberative democratic process even if the content of the laws are undemocratic. I leverage unique archival data on India’s counterinsurgency law to test these mechanisms. Specifically, the ministerial files on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and the parliamentary debates around them. I show how the Indian state selectively picks colonial-era laws to enact repression. Through process tracing, I find strong evidence for centralizing and increasing the repressive power of the state while not wanting to appear overtly authoritarian.","Keywords: Repression, Democracy, Rule of Law, Colonialism, India","Shubha Prasad","Shubha Prasad",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0130_0939_0931.html","Democracy at Stake: Mapping the Ebb and Flow of Democratic Influence in the United Nations General Assembly","The stagnation, or even decline, in the global spread of democracy over the past decade has motivated invigorated interest in, and production of, scholarly literature on the perils of democracy. The questions adressed cover how democracies die, how sanctions and interventions influence regime type and how regime type affects a country’s propensity for going to war. On the docket of most foreign ministers, the question of dealing with a changed international security situation looms large. If there is any international arena that might play a role in explaining or illustrating how states interact across the democracy-autocracy divide, it must be the UN. In this paper, we combine insights from literature on democracy and autocracy, deliberation in legislatures and the politics of the UN to investigate how democraticness shapes the network of the UN General Assembly. Applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) of member states in speeches of the United Nations general Debates (UNGD) and network centrality measures derived from these, we analyze the ebb and flow of democratic influence in the UNGA. Our findings indicate that there was a strong tendency to promote democratic states in the earlier periods of the UNGA. However, we find a marked shift in the 1980s, where democratic member states talk a lot more about autocratic states. We attribute this to a shift from optimism about the fruits of democracy to democratic imposition from the 1990s and onwards.","Keywords: united nations, network analysis, named entity recognition, democracy, autocracy","Vilde Djuve, Martin Søyland","Vilde Djuve","University of Oslo"," Martin Søyland","University of Oslo","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0131_0360_0467.html","Motivated Political Apathy","What accounts for the observed political apathy and associated authoritarian persistence in some countries despite their economic achievements? We develop a theoretical model of endogenous political preference formation and analyze its implications for the prospect of democracy. Agents, with present-biased preferences, invest in their political preference in the trade-off between curbing impulsive participation in protests and reaping democratic benefits from successful protests. The model features two distinct types of equilibria: political apathy and political engagement. Countries with an indulgent culture (high present-bias) are more likely to foster active political participation and democratic development, while countries with a culture of self-restraint (low present-bias) are more prone to political apathy, leading to opposite outcomes. Empirically, we use the Indulgence versus Restraint index from Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as a measure of self-restraint culture and find evidence that individuals in countries with strong self-restraint culture are less inclined to participate in political actions. We also uncover a negative association between self-restraint culture and the levels of democracy, as well as civil society development. Our instrumental variable (IV) estimations support causal interpretations of these relationships. These findings shed light on the formation of motivated preferences and their impact on social movements and political change.","Keywords: Culture, Motivated Preference, Political Activism, Present Bias, Protest, Self-Restraint","Fuhai Hong, Dong Zhang","Fuhai Hong","Lingnan University","Dong Zhang","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lingnan University","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0132_1749_0500.html","Electoral fate of party switchers","Party switching by members of parliament (MPs) is common in most younger democracies and is on the rise in established democracies. This study examines the re-election prospects of switchers. Switching is widely seen as a betrayal of voters’ trust that should be punished at the ballot box, but the existing evidence is mixed. While many studies find that switching reduces the re-election chances of MPs, others suggest that some forms of switching are less electorally damaging or even potentially beneficial. We examine how the electoral consequences vary depending on the destination of switching: (a) another existing parliamentary party group (defection), (b) a return to the fold (re-entry), (c) a new party group (split), or (d) parliamentary independence (exit). We expect the defectors and re-entrants to suffer the least because recipient parties, knowing that in-switchers can bring them additional votes, provide in-switchers with electable candidacies. MPs involved in splits become the splinter parties’ leading candidates whose re-election hinges on their party’s electoral performance. Exits usually lead to the severing of ties with all parties and may be the most damaging to re-election chances, unless an electoral system allows for the success of individual candidates (Ireland) or where exit is the only form of legislative switching allowed (Estonia). We test these expectations with a new dataset covering more than 1,000 switchers in eight European democracies: Estonia, Lithuania, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Romania.","Keywords: Legislative party switching, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, re-election","Raimondas Ibenskas","Raimondas Ibenskas","University of Bergen","Sona Golder","Pennsylvania State University","Paulina Salek-Lipcean","University of Bergen","Allan Sikk","University College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bergen","Pennsylvania State University","University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such an approach overlooks the growing importance of housing as a source of both socio-structural and electoral division. Using national election studies and household panel data from eleven countries, I conduct the first systematic, cross-national, and longitudinal analysis of the electoral behaviour of housing market groups, finding that housing represents a strong and growing electoral divide in advanced democracies. Electoral support for centre-right and ‘new left’ (that is, radical left and Green) parties is most strongly associated with housing market position, with homeowners significantly and increasingly more likely to support the former and renters significantly and increasingly more likely to support the latter. When other factors, such as house value and rental contract type are considered, housing-based electoral divides appear even greater in scope, to the extent that housing market position now appears a stronger predictor of voting for some party families – the centre-right and new left in particular – than labour market position. These findings challenge the claim that class or economic circumstances have become increasingly unimportant in structuring voting behaviour, and suggest an updated conceptualisation and operationalisation of social stratification – which moves beyond occupation and labour market position – is required to understand contemporary patterns of electoral alignment.","Keywords: Elections, class voting, political sociology, housing, social stratification","Josh Goddard","Josh Goddard",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Commitments to democracy, although widely spread among the citizens, are frequently combined with anti-liberal notions of democracy and can sometimes become a bargaining chip in the trade-off for implementation of preferred policy on a salient issue. Against this background, in a conjoint design fielded in seven European countries, we explore the impact on vote choice of populist, illiberal and authoritarian alternatives to liberal democracy on three basic dimensions: civil liberties, rule of law, and free and fair elections. Our findings show that voters opposed to immigration are willing to support parties that share their anti-immigration stances regardless of party positions on democracy, particularly regarding the rule of law. However, when it comes to civil liberties and free and fair election, voters tend to support populist alternatives to liberal democracy to a greater degree than the illiberal and authoritarian ones.","Keywords: populism, illiberalism, authoritarianism, support for democracy, immigration","Piotr Zagórski","Ben Stanley","SWPS University","Jan Rovny","Science Po Paris","Piotr Zagórski","SWPS University","Marta Vukovic","University of Vienna","","","","","","","","","","","","","SWPS University","Science Po Paris","University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, we lack a consistent measure to see inside the ""black box"" of parties, hindering our ability to study factions comparatively or understand the drivers of temporal trends. We construct an original dataset of party factionalism in candidate and leadership contests, national legislatures, and party organizations between 1990 and 2024 for all major parties across seven countries; the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Canada, and Mexico. We use this combination of sources to propose a composite measure of party factionalism that can be used comparatively across time and space. Under this measure, we find that factional conflict in many of these parties steadily declined during the 1990s and early 2000s, then increased from 2007 onwards with a stark increase in intra-party factionalism in parties. Increased factionalism was primarily driven by conflict in the traditional parties of the center-right (conservatives and Christian democrats) and center-left (social democrats). Trends of growing intra-party factionalism are commonly attributed to parties ""opening up"" their processes with more intra-party democracy that include more diverse actors. Instead, we show that our descriptive trends are more closely connected to the entrance of new issues into the political sphere (policy) and the new affordances of digital technology that enable faction-oriented actors to foster horizontal and vertical connections (connectivity).","Keywords: intra-party, factions, comparative politics, political communication, party organizations","Mike Cowburn","Mike Cowburn","European University Viadrina","Amelia Malpas","Harvard University","Rachel Blum","University of Oklahoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Viadrina","Harvard University","University of Oklahoma",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

New Evidence on Environmentalist Voters and Party Competition","There are systematic differences in the electoral success of green parties between East and West European party systems. While research demonstrates that environmental issues resonate with voters in both regions and that parties compete on these issues, significant disparities in green party support persist. Existing literature attributes these differences to factors such as levels of post-materialism, the salience of tangible environmental problems, and variations in electoral systems. However, why the environmental vote is not directed at green parties in Central and Eastern Europe remains an underexplored question. Using data from the 2019 European Election Study, this article shows that environmentalist voters in Central and Eastern Europe are more likely to vote for non-green parties, driven by perceptions of these parties’ lack of competence on environmental issues and their competitiveness against other parties. Further, the findings challenge the post-materialist theory by demonstrating that environmental issues matter to voters and parties across Europe, irrespective of regional context. These results show the increasingly pro-environmental role non-green parties play in East Europe and replicates results showing that the competitive advantage of green parties in West Europe is contingent on party system dynamics and rules that facilitate niche party success. By shedding light on how environmental issues are contested in Europe, this study deepens our understanding of the evolving role of environmental politics in diverse political systems.","Keywords: Environmental politics, environmental voters, green party, issue competence","Ville Haapanen","Ville Haapanen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Tartu",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although traditional explanatory factors such as political interest, internal political efficacy, and political knowledge exhibit gender differences, our findings suggest these variables do not substantially explain gender differences in the propensity to vote in Spain. Contrary to expectations, we find no overall gender gap in Spanish voter turnout. However, significant disparities emerge within specific demographics: younger voters, those with intermediate political interest, and ideological centrists display notable gender-based differences in electoral participation.Our findings further reveal that Spain's political fragmentation—marked by emerging parties and the breakdown of the two-party system—has predominantly mobilized men rather than women voters. We attribute this pattern to the absence of strong gendered political affiliations, persisting even in parties featuring women in prominent electoral positions.","Keywords: Gender gaps, Modern sexism, Period effects, Political backlash, Panel analysis","Paula Zuluaga","Eva Anduiza","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona - UAB"," Guillem Rico","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona - UAB"," Paula Zuluaga","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona - UAB","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona - UAB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our analysis shows that the establishment of LKPR chapters was associated with increased support for unmarried women and orphans but had no significant effect on the number of widows who were supported, likely because widows were already covered by provisions for their deceased husbands.

In order to understand the source of these disparities and whether they are discriminatory, it is indispensable to understand bureaucrats' beliefs about claimants' eligibility-relevant outcomes. In this article, I review theories about preference-based, accurate, and inaccurate belief-based discrimination for bureaucratic decision that depend on expectations about outcomes. Thereafter, I use micro-level data from the Swiss UI system to provide empirical evidence on the role of beliefs in the provision of unemployment services. Ideally, unemployment service provision should discriminate based solely on factors related to employability, not on irrelevant characteristics that do not affect job prospects. I develop an identification strategy based on causal machine learning to disentangle unwarranted disparities in beliefs, preference partiality, and outcome disparities. I find that beliefs are systematically biased against immigrants which partly explains their overrepresentation in programs for claimants with lower employability, such as workfare programs. Additionally, I examine how belief bias varies across bureaucrats with different genders, job roles, and levels of experience. Disentangling whether disparities are due to beliefs, preference, or  differences in outcome distributions is relevant for the design of policy. Beliefs can be corrected with information, while constraining preferences requires different solutions, such as institutional oversight.","Keywords: bureaucracy, inequality, biased beliefs, UI claimants, caseworkers","John Körtner","John Körtner",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Lausanne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0142_0351_1271.html","The nomination of LGBT candidates in proportional electoral systems","The nomination of openly LGBT candidates is often seen in the US literature as a supply-side phenomenon. Namely, LGBT candidates will arise in those single-member districts whose population holds more favorable views toward the LGBT community. This approach overlooks the role of political parties actively recruiting minority candidates under some circumstances or hindering them in others. Moreover, it needs to consider how parties acting within proportional systems aim to produce balanced tickets to appeal to a broad group of voters. This paper introduces a new way to understand the nomination of LGBT candidates in such systems by combining the supply and demand sides. We propose that LGBT candidates will be more likely to appear in places with organized LGBT activism and be recruited by left-wing parties. Furthermore, we analyze the biographies of the nominated LGBT candidates to test the two mechanisms driving the previous relationships: increased tolerance and selective recruitment. We empirically assess these relations using a novel dataset on Spanish LGBT candidates and activist organizations.","Keywords: Candidate Selection, LGBT, Descriptive Representation, Proportional Electoral System, Activism","Javier Martinez Canto","Javier Martinez Canto","Universidad de Salamanca, Spain; IBEI, Spain","Joel Cantó-Roche","University of Toronto, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Toronto, Canada","Universidad de Salamanca, Spain","IBEI, Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, studying toxic users presents significant challenges. On social media platforms, such users are rare (as a proportion of all users), limiting sample sizes in experiments. Moreover, research is restricted to observing behavioral outcomes, leaving underlying motivations unclear. In controlled settings, such as experimental chatrooms, ethical concerns arise from exposing participants to toxicity, and it is uncertain whether toxic behavior can be reliably elicited.This paper introduces a novel methodology that combines a custom chatroom environment with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents to address these challenges. This approach enables the recruitment and engagement of toxic users while ensuring that no human participants are exposed to harmful content. Within the chatroom, LLM agents simulate distinct conversational dynamics and norms and deliver interventions, such as counterspeech. This setup allows researchers to evaluate both behavioral changes (e.g., shifts in toxic behavior) and self-reported survey responses collected post-interaction. We evaluate the feasibility of recruiting toxic users, the effectiveness of strategies to induce toxic behavior in a controlled environment, and the impact of interventions designed to reduce toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this approach to advance the study of toxic online behavior and inform the development of evidence-based strategies for improving online discourse.","Keywords: hate speech, toxic speech, experiments, LLMs","Fabrizio Gilardi, Colin Henry, Karsten Donnay","Fabrizio Gilardi","University of Zurich"," Colin Henry","University of Zurich"," Karsten Donnay","University of Zurich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To this end, we conduct a survey experiment embedded in an in-person survey with 2,000 respondents in Zimbabwe in November 2024, examining how different framing strategies may correct beliefs shaped by government narratives. The study also investigates potential implications for citizen involvement in anti-regime mobilization, contributing to the literature on the ``repression-punishment puzzle''.

Whether voters idealise democratic principles at any cost however, remains unknown. We contend that the impact of party reforms also influence perceptions. In particular, voters favour reforms that foster increased participation and reduce disagreement between d ifferent party actors. Citizens appreciate reforms that exhibit democratic principles, but become more sceptical when reforms are found to have negative outcomes. We evaluate this perspective through two pre-registered survey experiments of UK residents that describe reforms to the mode of intra-party deliberation during the pandemic and the size of the selectorate for deciding the party leader. Respondents remain more supportive of reforms and satisfied with democracy when reforms purport to increase inclusivity, but also decrease disagreements within parties.

This paper examines the effects of reports about local soldiers killed in action (KIA) during the ongoing war in Ukraine on online political behavior reflecting patriotic sentiment or regime support in soldiers' hometowns. Using more than 20 million posts from 36,000 geo-referenced social media groups, we employ topic-specific engagement metrics as proxies for authorities' approval and patriotism. Leveraging variation in the timing of KIA reports across Russian municipalities and a staggered treatment rollout design, we show that war fatalities lead to a sustained decline in social media engagement with content referencing authorities, with the magnitude of this effect increasing over the course of the war. At the same time, interaction with patriotic and military topics temporarily increases, primarily driven by engagement with posts referencing the war in Ukraine and fallen soldiers. In addition, these effects are amplified in municipalities where local online group administrators publish soldiers' obituaries, highlighting the importance of direct access to information for the effect to develop fully. Sentiment analysis further reveals that engagement with propagandistic content – emotionally appealing and politically relevant – drops after KIA reports for both patriotic and regime-related topics, suggesting that exposure to war fatalities erodes trust in state-promoted narratives. These findings highlight the critical role of personal exposure to war casualties and access to such information in shaping public discourse, with implications for understanding political attitudes in conflict settings.","Keywords: War, propaganda, social media, autocracy","Vladimir Zabolotskiy","Vladimir Zabolotskiy","Free University of Bozen-Bolzano","Ivan Fomichev","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Free University of Bozen-Bolzano","European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing research highlights strategies such as falsifying information or deflecting blame for poor economic performance. Examining China’s political communication on its shift in development models, we offer an additional answer to the question. Over the past decade, China has faced significant economic challenges and responded by introducing the High-Quality Development (HQD) model, which acknowledges economic difficulties but seeks to redefine how citizens evaluate the economy. Analyzing data from Chinese state media, we find robust patterns across models that the promotion of HQD is more likely following the release of GDP statistics and during periods of high food prices. To test the causal effect of this strategy, we conducted a survey experiment in which we randomize the exposure of a real official HQD message. Consistent with our theory, exposure to the HQD narrative shifts individuals’ evaluation of the economy from a focus on growth to a vague notion of ""quality"" and boosts their confidence in the economy despite recognizing its slowdown.

"abstract_0149_1396_0100.html","Group-Based Congruence and Political Trust","One important driver of citizens’ political trust is opinion congruence, i.e., the extent to which citizens’ political preferences are in line with those of their representatives. Previous research on this relation has focused on either egocentric congruence (congruence with a citizen’s own position) or sociotropic congruence (congruence with the electorate overall). Departing from research on group-based representation deficits, we propose another possibility that has been overlooked so far: When evaluating trustworthiness, citizens rely on the extent to which their social group is substantively represented. In this contribution, we study the effect of such group-based congruence with regard to social classes in the European context. We hypothesize that the more distant the government is to the preferences of one’s social class, the lower an individual’s political trust. To study this relation, we combine individual-level data from the European Social Survey (ESS) with elite-level data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), measuring congruence on the left-right scale and on specific policy issues. Beyond adding a new perspective to research on congruence and political trust, we contribute to research on unequal congruence and responsiveness. This research has revealed how the preferences of socioeconomically disadvantaged classes are typically less well represented and influential than those of advantaged classes. Here, we ask whether this has implications for affected citizens’ political support in that members of classes whose preferences are not well represented have lower levels of political trust—and whether such class-based congruence matters above and beyond egocentric congruence.","Keywords: congruence,  representation, political trust, public opinion, social classes","Nils Steiner","Lucca Hoffeller","Goethe University Frankfurt","Nils Steiner","Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Goethe University Frankfurt","Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0151_2289_0552.html","Saturation in migration policy - Explaining patterns of policy stability and change","Migration regulations have increasingly become a politicized area of policy, requiring policymakers to respond to evolving societal and economic dynamics. Despite this focus, the policy portfolios of Western destination countries exhibit remarkable stability over time, suggesting migration policy is a saturated field with few new policy target groups and limited innovative measures. This research investigates mechanisms of change within this saturated environment.This study analyzes the immigration and integration policies of ten OECD countries from 1975 to 2020, leveraging a novel dataset for detailed cross-country comparisons. By examining patterns in policy instruments for specific immigrant admission categories, it identifies similarities, divergences, and distinctive national approaches. Simultaneous analysis of immigration and integration policies reveals a comprehensive picture of each country's migration policy framework.A key finding is the differential saturation between immigration and integration portfolios. The majority of countries have integration portfolios that are less saturated, with notable variation between them. Notably, countries with less sophisticated integration policy frameworks also tend to make fewer adjustments to existing measures. Despite the stability of the overarching policy framework, an increase in fine-grained changes is observed at both policy levels across countries. This results in a rise in regulatory complexity. These findings underscore significant variations and enhance our understanding of migration policy dynamics.This work addresses a critical gap in the literature by unifying immigration and integration frameworks in a holistic analytical model. Moving beyond restrictiveness or temporal trends, it identifies overlooked patterns and shifts, enhancing insights into how countries navigate migration governance.","Keywords: migration policy, immigration, integration, policy portfolios","Vanessa Millich","Vanessa Millich",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Chair for Empirical Theories of Politics, Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science (GSI), Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0152_1170_0230.html","Energy Costs and the Political Economy of the Green Energy Transition: Evidence from the EU","Do changes in energy prices impact individuals' attitudes towards the energy transition? Global energy markets are highly interconnected, making them a source of globalization that can impact public policy preferences. Shifts in energy prices due to global supply shocks or other crises impact household energy expenditures, cost of living, income, and inequality. A key question is how individuals will react to shifts in energy prices: will this affect environmental concern, public support of climate and energy policies, or other political attitudes? Which regions and social groups are more likely to be affected and respond more? I study changes in attitudes in the time frame of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to a drastic increase in energy prices. I combine energy price data with geographical variation in energy use in an instrumental variables framework to study individual-level changes in public attitudes to answer this question. The focus is on the EU, which in 2020 imported 57\% of the energy it consumed, 24.4% coming from Russia. Initial results suggest that higher energy prices increase energy concerns but have a very small relative impact on environmental concerns, suggesting that worry about climate change is not crowded out by higher energy prices in this context.","Keywords: Environmental politics, energy transition,  globalization","Ireri Hernandez Carballo","Ireri Hernandez Carballo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi UniversityRFF-CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0153_0335_0333.html","When Natural Disasters hit Resource Extraction Sites: the Role of Third-Party Extractive Actors in Mitigating Post-Disaster Violence During Civil War","How natural disasters affect conflict in war-torn countries is an important question, given the  increasing prevalence of natural disasters due to climate change. Existing literature presents a disparate and seemingly contradictory findings on the disaster-conflict nexus, suggesting a need to examine potential moderators. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the presence of resource extraction sites as a key moderator for the relationship between natural disasters and violent incidents. I argue that third-party extractive actors mitigate post-disaster violence by influencing armed groups’ strategies, with the effect differing by resource type. In capital-intensive resource-rich territories (e.g., large-scale mining and oil and gas extraction), third-party actors stabilise post-disaster environment by buying off armed groups whose disruptive capacity is weakened by disasters. Conversely, in labour-intensive resource-rich territories (e.g., small-scale and artisanal mining), third-party extractive actors’ influence is limited and post-disaster disruption of the balance of power between armed groups leads to fights over the control of the resource. Using sub-national and geo-referenced data on violent incidents between the government and the rebels and resource licenses in Myanmar between 2010 and 2018, results show that while resource extraction sites generally mitigate the conflict-intensifying effect of natural disasters, this effect varies by resource type. The presence of capital-intensive resource extraction sites such large mining and oil and gas extraction are associated with lower risk of violent incidents compared to labour-intensive resource sites. Moreover, the operational timeframe of these extraction sites plays a crucial role: sites nearing license expiration display weaker mitigating effects on violent incidents.","Keywords: Natural Disasters, Resources, Civil wars","Wangyin Zhao","Wangyin Zhao",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"School of Government and International Affairs, Durham University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thisdecision ran against the grain of British political thought and political development, which counseled extreme caution in any extension of the franchise beyond the propertied and theliterate. It also ran counter to the preferences of Ceylon’s indigenous leaders, who expressedlittle interest in suffrage expansion in their testimonies before the DonoughmoreCommission, which came to Ceylon from November 1927 - January 1928 to devise a newconstitution. Through what collective reasoning process did the Donoughmore Commissiondecide to make Ceylon what would henceforth be considered the first non-white democracyin the world? We argue that British officials began during their visit to Ceylon to think about“safeguards” in a fundamentally new way. Reversing the conventional, quintessentiallyBritish logic that anti-majoritarian safeguards (e.g. courts, veto powers, and most of all astrictly restricted suffrage) are essential to constrain the irrational impulses of the generalvoting public, the Donoughmore Commission gradually concluded that Ceylon’s populationurgently needed mass enfranchisement to safeguard the colony against the empowerment of anarrow, non-responsive indigenous political elite. What one commissioner called “themischief of the franchise” lay not in a franchise that was too wide, as one might expect givenBritish political traditions, but too narrow.

"abstract_0155_1356_0930.html","Authoritarian linkages and the diffusion of repression between authoritarian regimes","What can enhance the diffusion of repression between autocracies? Existing research does not provide a clear answer to this question, suggesting that it could be geographical proximity or similarity of political institutions. These are classical approaches to study of any diffusion. In this paper, I argue that one of the important determinants of the repression diffusion is the existence of linkages between autocracies. Authoritarian linkages may reduce the costs of finding effective repressive strategies, by providing fast and broad communication channels between states. In that case, dictators do not need to develop native toolkits. For instance, membership in international organizations or military alliances can facilitate diffusion by providing more opportunities for interagency cooperation and information sharing. This cooperation enables autocrats to collaborate with different autocracies, not just with neighboring countries or regimes with similar institutional structures as suggested in existing research. Another example is trade, if much of the state revenue depends on trade with other autocracies, elites will be interested in maintaining the status quo in trading partner countries, which can enhance the learning process and direct support of repression apparatus in partner country. I test these propositions based on data on bilateral trade, military and trade alliances, joint military exercises, and other indicators of authoritarian linkages. Quantitative analysis with different specifications of the dependent variable (which is based on Political Terror Scale and Mass Mobilization in Autocracy databases) shows strong support for the theory and takes another step towards understanding the mechanisms of the spread of repressive practices.","Keywords: State repression, authoritarian regimes, authoritarian diffusion, human rights violation","Liza Popkova","Liza Popkova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University, Department of Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The media can provide warnings about the incumbent’s behavior.  However voters don’t know whether the media is a neutral provider of information or a biased type making false accusations against the incumbent.  We analyze how voters react when the incumbent alleges that the media is biased and untrustworthy.  This, in turn, allows us to analyze whether there is a complementarity between electoral subversion and anti-media rhetoric, i.e., under what conditions does the possibility of undermining the media make it easier for an incumbent to subvert elections and move towards autocracy.[Background information: we have been toying with a model of this sort for a couple of years and we have some results, but we haven’t fully solved it out or written it up].","Keywords: electoral accountability, democratic backsliding, autocracy, media","Ken Shotts","Anqi Li","University of Waterloo","Ken Shotts","Stanford Graduate School of Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stanford Graduate School of Business","University of Waterloo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While it is well-established that voters do not consistently sanction corrupt politicians at the ballot box, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a survey experiment conducted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Germany (n=6000), we employ an innovative digital visualization tool that allows participants to create their ideal politician by selecting descriptive characteristics (age, gender, ethnic background, and social class) and preferred political behaviors. Respondents are then randomly assigned to scenarios where either their ideal politician or a standard, predefined politician is involved in a corruption scandal. This design enables us to examine whether politicians’ similarity to their constituents (homophily/descriptive representation) or their history of advocating for specific group interests (substantive representation) affects citizens’ reactions to political misconduct.  We show that politicians who share demographic characteristics with their constituents or have a history of advocating their specific interests are perceived as more trustworthy, are more likely to be forgiven, and hence have a higher likelihood of continued electoral support despite corruption. By integrating insights from representation and accountability research, this study deepens our understanding of voter behavior in the face of political corruption and highlights the trade-offs between personalized representation and democratic accountability.","Keywords: legislators, corruption, survey experiment, homophily, substantive representation","Stefanie Bailer","Stefanie Bailer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of BaselUniversity of BaselUniversity of FrankfurtUniversity of FrankfurtUniversity of Frankfurt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0158_0821_0599.html","Correcting Misperceptions about Subjective Social Status Reduces Populist Voting","Much research argues a low subjective social status to be a strong predictor of support for populist-authoritarian parties. Perceptions of a low social status are subjective and consequently based on voters' beliefs about what other members of society think though. We argue that voters misperceive feelings of being left behind to be widespread, providing justification for supporting populist-authoritarian actors. When being informed about the real distribution of subjective social status, voters not only update their perceptions but also become less likely to vote for populist parties. We use an innovative and pre-registered pre-post survey experiment conducted in the context of the 2024 elections in Eastern Germany to test this theory. We find that correcting citizens' misperception about the prevalence of a low subjective status strongly and lastingly changes their attitudes. The treatment also appears to affect voting intentions and actual voting behavior. Additional analyses suggest that this is because voters update their perceptions of the status of their social group rather than their perceptions of government performance or political trust. This has immediate implications for scholarly work concerned with populist voting and political initiatives aimed at countering populist parties.","Keywords: Social Status, Populism, Survey Experiment, Voting Behavior","Markus Kollberg","Heike Klüver","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Anselm Hager","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Markus Kollberg","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0159_0835_0601.html","Of fields and ballots. European farmers’ voting in comparative perspective (CVSD panel)","Recent years have witnessed large-scale mobilizations of farmers across Europe, driven by dissatisfaction with excessive EU bureaucratization, trade agreements, and insufficient subsidies. Farmer’s mobilizations have been often supported by radical-right parties and politicians, who see common ground with their electoral platforms and aspire to increase their share of votes. However, is there a widespread connection between agricultural employment and voting that goes beyond the specific support expressed by radical-right forces in moments of intense public mobilization? Situated within the broader framework of occupational influences on voting, this study examines how working in agriculture affects support for parties along the GAL/TAN and economic dimensions of competition. Our methodological strategy combines five waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) (including 26 countries from 2012 to 2020) to obtain data on occupation and voting preferences, and data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) to extract the positioning of parties along the main ideological dimensions of competition. Our findings reveal a robust and significant association between agricultural employment and support for parties with more traditionalist, authoritarian, and nationalist tendencies. This association varies considerably across countries and regions, reflecting contextual nuances in the activation and expression of farmer’s demands in the electoral arena. These results contribute to understand when and how working in agriculture associates with voting, which is also connected with broader debates on the link between occupation and electoral choices in contemporary societies.","Keywords: radical-right, voting behaviour, cleavage, occupations","Álvaro Sánchez-García","Álvaro Sánchez-García","Universidad de Salamanca"," Hugo Marcos-Marne","Universidad de Salamanca","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad de Salamanca",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, political scientists have gone again and again to the same weathered tools in the spatial toolkit. This paper identifies spatial eigenfunction analysis (SEA)---particularly Moran eigenvector maps---as an underutilized tool that expands the spatial toolkit available to practitioners. SEA describes the relationship in spatial data based on (a combination of) eigenvectors which represent all possible map patterns at different spatial resolutions. Simulation exercises demonstrate that SEA offers multiple advantages for exploratory and inferential spatial analysis. First, it outperforms common approaches (such as Moran’s I) for identifying, visualizing, and simulating complex spatial patterns. Second, it facilitates the construction of a synthetic proxy variable that mimics the observed spatial structure to remove spatial dependence from model residuals. Finally, it partitions the proportion of explained variance in an outcome to the effects of covariates, space, and shared spatial structure. Thereby, it allows researchers to derive additional valuable insights from spatial data.","Keywords: Spatial modeling, spatial econometrics, eigenfunction analysis","Laron Williams","Sebastian Juhl","SAP SE; University of Missouri","Laron Williams","University of Missouri","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SAP SE","University of Missouri",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0161_0333_0796.html","IPCON01: Party Congress Motions as a Window into the Black Box","Throughout modern democracies, political parties’ decisions on programs, policies, and personnel are the result of intraparty actors’ preferences and discussions. However, these internal dynamics behind such decisions remain largely unknown because of strong data limitations, known as the “black box of intra-party politics”. We argue that motions, i.e., proposed courses of action that are brought before a party assembly for consideration, debate, and/or decision by an individual or a group that are members/affiliates of the party, offer a unique window to reveal the processes and dynamics behind parties’ official decisions. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of motions with the help of a novel dataset, the Party Congress Motion Dataset (PCMD). It contains motions proposed to annual party congresses (N = 149) from all major parties in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands (N = 20) over the period 2017-2022, a total of more than 17,413 individual motions. We use the data to create measures of intraparty preferences, engagement, divisions, and actors’ relative power that are more precise, valid, and dynamic than existing ones. The results show how varied intraparty preferences and dynamics are across European parties and time, and that they are not always following the expected patterns. Methodologically, we contribute to the literature by showing how to extract meaningful and comparable information from large, diverse, and unstructured number of archival documents via a mix of manual and computational methods.","Keywords: Political parties, intraparty politics, party motions, archival data","Jacob Gunderson","Jacob Gunderson","University of Gothenburg"," Ann-Kristin Kölln","University of Gothenburg"," Elin Alfredsson Malmros","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0162_1574_0731.html","Different crises, same impact? EU issue voting in times of crises","This study investigates whether attitudes towards European integration influence voting behavior in European Parliament elections in times of different crises. While traditionally regarded as second-order national elections, recent research suggests that the crisis and the European Union's (EU) expanded role in economic policy may have heightened the politicization of European integration. The paper also analyzes if the major crises the Union has been going through—the economic and financial crisis, the migration crisis, and the climate crisis—might have a similar or rather different impact. By examining cross-national post-electoral data from the European Election Studies (from 2004 to 2024), this paper explores the relationship between voter attitudes towards the EU in times of different crises. Are there any differences between the economic crisis (between 2004, 2009, and 2014), the migration crisis (between 2014 and 2019), and the climate crisis (between 2019 and 2024)?  The empirical analysis examines the existence and extent of EU issue voting in European Parliament elections, employing a conditional logit (CL) regression model. The conditional logit model allows us to use not only case-specific independent variables but also alternative-specific ones. The results highlight the complexity of multi-level governance and the evolving dynamics of EU issue voting, suggesting the need for further investigation into country-specific variations.","Keywords: Crises, elections, European Parliament, Euroscepticism","Aleksandra Sojka","Ilke Toygür","IE University","Aleksandra Sojka","University Carlos III of Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University Carlos III of Madrid","IE University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0163_0898_0863.html","A practical guide on what not to write on the internet (if you are a dissident of an authoritarian regime)","As opposed to traditional forms of repression that were exercised almost exclusively within the jurisdiction of authoritarian states, the availability of social media has globalised both the expression of dissent by diaspora communities and the (transnational) reach of repressive actors. What makes a dissident’s online commentary dangerous enough to provoke prosecution or disappearance in an authoritarian regime? To answer this question, we investigate the online behaviour of critics and activists in repressive regimes from 2011 to 2024, examining what distinguishes those who are targeted by the state from those who remain unharmed. By focusing on what individuals post online and how they frame their comments, this study sheds light on the mechanisms by which authoritarian governments identify and suppress dissent. Our approach combines data from diverse digital sources, including social media posts, blogs, and public statements, to create a dataset of individuals who have faced state repression and those who have not. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we systematically analyse the linguistic and contextual features of these online messages. The analysis highlights how certain expressions of dissent or criticism intersect with the strategies and priorities of authoritarian regimes, making some individuals more vulnerable to targeting. This study focuses on the methodological challenges of identifying repressive triggers in digital expression, providing a framework for future research on state surveillance and control. By examining the interaction between language and power, we offer insights into the risks associated with online dissent in authoritarian contexts.","Keywords: Digital repression, Transnational authoritarianism, Online dissent, State surveillance, Social media activism","Christos Christodoulou, Nikandros Ioannidis","Christos Christodoulou","University of Cyprus","Iosif Kovras","University of Cyprus","Nikandros Ioannidis","Cyprus University of Technology","Constantinos Djouvas","Cyprus University of Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Cyprus","Cyprus University of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I test this theory using the case of the post-Civil War U.S. South and novel data on the formation of local chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), which mobilized extensively around honoring and rehabilitating the reputation of Confederate veterans through memorial and historical education activities that spread the “Lost Cause” ideology to Southern whites. Using county-level data on Civil War battles, I find evidence that UDC chapters were more likely to exist in counties where there were intensive negative shocks to Confederate soldiers’ lives and reputations, as measured by Confederate army battle losses. I support this argument with qualitative evidence on gendered humiliation of Confederate soldiers and discourse in UDC meeting minutes.

"abstract_0165_0428_1097.html","The Bureaucratic Politics of Environmental Decentralization","Environmental decentralization has been promoted over the past 40 years to improve policy efficiency and fairness. However, the outcomes have been mixed. While some countries have found positive results, decentralization has led to overexploitation and increased pollution spillovers due to administrative and political fragmentation, particularly in the Global South. Scholars usually attribute the drawbacks of environmental decentralization to corruption and rent-seeking, the blame-avoidance opportunities created by blurred administrative borders, and political misalignment across government levels. One overlooked dimension is the role of bureaucratic politics in explaining the outcomes of decentralization. This paper explores how the structure and politics of the bureaucracy determine the effectiveness of environmental decentralization. I analyze public organizations’ professionalization and politicization as drivers of the state’s capacity to implement and coordinate environmental decentralization. Furthermore, I argue that bureaucratic professionalization reduces risks of local political capture, enabling decentralization’s benefits. However, excessive professionalization may hinder flexibility and innovation. Using dynamic panel methods on a sample of ~90 countries from 2002 to 2020, I show that, conditional on the politicization and professionalization of the bureaucracy, environmental decentralization has heterogeneous and non-linear effects on environmental outcomes. This research sheds light on the public sector reforms required to capture the potential advantages of environmental decentralization.","Keywords: Environmental decentralization, Environmental outcomes, Bureaucratic politics, Public sector reform","Santiago Quintero","Santiago Quintero",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For political parties, selecting a balance of demographic backgrounds can be a key recruitment and selection strategy to ensure a competitive candidacy. For politicians, the strategic use of visible identity markers can signal trustworthiness, personal relatability, or perceived policy positions to voters. And for voters, snap judgments about politicians’ individual backgrounds, along with party affiliation, can serve as persuasive heuristics. But how do these factors compare across different systems? Do political parties try to recruit an ‘optimal’ mix of candidate backgrounds that aligns with voter preferences? We exploit the natural institutional variation found in European Parliament elections to explore the link between the candidate nominations, demographic backgrounds, and electoral outcomes. Drawing upon novel observational data on all candidacies to the European Parliament, 2014-2024, we pair candidate background data from electoral lists with voter preferences declared as part of the European Election Studies. We assess the extent to which parties select candidates that provide a descriptive 'fit' with the voters that they represent.

Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Spain.","The literature on electoral systems has focused mainly on the elites' preferences devoting little attention to studying what people think about electoral rules. The present paper seeks to contribute to this understudied branch of the literature by analysing to what extent political and territorial preferences determine citizens' attitudes towards the electoral system. I argue that people do not have clear preferences about the electoral rules and that their ideological and territorial biases will condition their satisfaction towards the electoral system. To test this argument, I conduct a vignette-survey-experiment in Spain (n=3010) where I manipulate the information given to respondents through different treatments. The experiment treatments show different information indicating that the electoral system disadvantages certain parties or territories. The results show that having a right-wing ideology has a negative effect on satisfaction with the electoral system. However, this effect turns positive when people are informed that left-wing parties such as Sumar or territories such as Barcelona are disadvantaged. On the other hand, effects remain negative but do not increase when is reported that Madrid is disadvantaged compared to pro-independence territories such as Lleida or that the far-right party Vox is disadvantaged. These findings confirm our expectations. People’s preferences towards the electoral system are inconsistent and strongly conditioned by ideology and territorial preferences, especially among right-wing voters.","Keywords: Electoral system.

"abstract_0169_0755_1341.html","Identitarian Framing and Attitudes Towards Human Rights Debates","Authoritarian regimes commonly deflect criticism of their human rights records by employing a type of rhetorical argument colloquially referred to as “whataboutery,” which accuses critical countries of being hypocritical by highlighting their own abuses. In recent years, a new type of whataboutery has emerged. Using language commonly associated with progressive identity politics, this “identitarian whataboutery” frames criticism from Western countries as racist or colonialist, while also drawing attention to Western abuses against historically disadvantaged groups. This study empirically examines the effectiveness of identitarian whataboutery through a framing experiment in the United States. Using the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as a case, we develop two frames: one discussing Qatari human rights abuses against migrant workers, and the other discussing abuses against sexual minorities. For each frame, participants are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a neutral control condition, a treatment condition where they are exposed to an identitarian whataboutery argument, or a treatment condition where they are exposed to a traditional, materialist whataboutery argument. We examine the effects of our treatments on attitudes towards humanitarian intervention, support for the universality of human rights, and evaluations of the US’ human rights record.

We argue this that seeming paradox can partly be explained by the social nature of democratic support: Citizens’ support for democracy and democratic principles is shaped by social norms about democracy, sensitive to social pressure and therefore malleable to different environments. This study draws on lab experiments to directly explore how social norms and environments influence citizens’ democratic preferences and behavior in a controlled environment where citizens interact in-person. In the lab, we elicit norms related to democracy and anti-democratic behavior, then manipulate social settings to examine how preferences shift in public versus private contexts and under varying perceptions of social norms. We also use interactive behavioral games to assess participants’ willingness to punish anti-democratic actions by others and conduct group discussions to explore the dynamics of social pressure and norm enforcement. Complementing the lab, we also use online surveys to measure social norms surrounding democracy and evaluate citizens’ willingness to conform to perceived changes in these norms in a broader sample of citizens. Our study yields insight into whether the perceived collective adherence to democracy in many societies depends on perceived social norms, and thereby vulnerable to perceived shifts in social environments and norms.","Keywords: Democracy, democratic support, social norms, lab experiments,","Sirianne Dahlum","Sirianne Dahlum","University of Oslo","Daniel Goldstein","University of Oslo","Andreas Kotsadam","Frisch Centre","Alexander Wuttke","Munich University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","Frisch Centre","Munich University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a series of recent contributions, David Stasavage has broadened the view of early democracy beyond the handful of well-known ancient and early modern European experiments. Relying on the anthropological database known as the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), Stasavage (Stasavage 2020; Ahmed and Stasavage 2020) has shed new light on the origins of historical democracies, arguing that early democracies developed where information asymmetries made it harder for rulers to extract revenue, when the size of the community was small, and when subjects had an exit option. The measure of early democracy employed in these studies, however, provides only a limited picture of the types of governance subsumed under the label “democracy” – indeed, democracy simply means the presence of a council. Drawing on a new, unique dataset of historical communities engaged in collective governance across the world and throughout history (from the 4th millennium BCE to the 20th century CE), this paper tests Stasavage’s account. In so doing, it provides a more accurate picture of the conditions that enabled different types of democratic governance to emerge in different regions, times, and across different community sizes.","Keywords: early democracy, institutions, history and political economy","Federica Carugati","Federica Carugati",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0173_2171_0126.html","Monopolizing Religious Markets: Religious Opposition and Autocratic Investments in Religious Education","Why do governments invest in religious education? Focusing on the recent expansion of governmental Qur'anic schools in Egypt, we argue that state-sponsored Qur'anic schools are more likely to be placed in districts with an established Muslim Brotherhood presence and high levels of competition between government and private providers of religious services. This is because governmental control of religious schooling at the local level allows the government to sway younger generations away from supporting the Islamist opposition. We test our argument using a novel dataset of Qur'anic religious schooling and the structure of local religious markets in Egypt, as well as, contemporary survey data. The paper sheds light on the critical role of educational management in the consolidation of autocratic regimes and their stability.","Keywords: religion, education, authoritarianism, political economy of religion, MENA politics","Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed","Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed","Toulouse School of Economics","Allison Hartnett","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Toulouse School of Economics","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0174_2342_0099.html","Speak of the Devil: Post-Authoritarian Stigmatization in Parliamentary Speeches Across Europe","Extant research highlights voter backlash against previous regimes, yet little is known about how political elites in new democracies frame their discourse to distance themselves from the regime's ideological legacy. How do they employ ideological references, and what sentiment do they attach to them? How often do they refer to the former regime and to what extent do they frame such references in ideological terms?  To address these questions, we analyze parliamentary speeches, which offer a continuous flow of political discourse and capture the dynamics of ideological bias during democratic transitions. Using the ParlSpeech corpus, we apply Deep Transfer Learning to speeches from Czechia (1993–2016), emerging from a Left-Wing regime, and Spain (1996–2018), transitioning from the Right-Wing Francoist regime in the late 1970s. We fine-tune state-of-the-art RoBERTa and DeBERTa transformer-based models to integrate domain-specific insights from human coders (Laurer et al., 2024). Namely, we employ quasi-sentences categorized into the 56 policy areas of the Comparative Manifesto Project coding scheme. This enables us to detect key dimensions such as attitudes toward democracy, the constitution, minorities, communism, and economic policy. Each sentence’s “sentiment” is then analyzed to uncover ideological framing. To ensure robustness, we complement our analysis with additional methods, including Random Forest classification (e.g., Djourelova, 2023) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (e.g., Di Cocco & Monechi, 2022). This approach allows us to systematically examine how political elites adapt discourse in response to ideological stigmatization and ideological legacy in new democracies.","Keywords: European parties, democratic transitions, political elites, text-as-data","Chen Zeng","Chen Zeng","European University Institute; King's College London","Riccardo Di Leo","European University Institute","Elias Dinas","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0175_1488_0187.html","Drivers of Local COVID-19 Restrictions: Evidence from Malawi","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread mandates—including lockdowns, social distancing, and curfews—aimed at controlling the spread of the virus and protecting public health. While critical, these measures often restricted democratic freedoms and had immense social and material costs for the individuals, sparking scholarly interest. Most existing research, however, focuses on the national level, overlooking the crucial role of local communities and leaders. In the Global South, local state authorities and customary leaders often played an important role in implementing and enforcing restrictions. Focusing on Malawi, a context characterized by substantial variation in the community-level implementation of anti-democratic restrictions, this study examines where and by whom mandates were implemented and enforced and why and when citizens complied with these measures. Specifically, we draw on locally representative panel survey data collected before and during the pandemic to investigate the influence of local governance structures and horizontal and vertical ties (e.g., relationships among citizens and between citizens and leaders) that shape implementation and compliance at both the individual and household levels. By investigating these dynamics, our research contributes to understanding the intersection of local governance and citizen compliance with restrictive measures during a public health crisis. It also provides broader implications for managing public health crises in contexts with limited state capacity and varying strengths of local leadership.","Keywords: Local Governance, Covid-19 Mandates, Social Ties, State vs. Customary Leaders, Malawi","Prisca Jöst","Prisca Jöst","Cornell University; Governance and Local Development Institute","Ellen Lust","Cornell University; Governance and Local Development Institute; University of Gothenburg","Erica Metheney","Governance and Local Development Institute; University of Gothenburg","Dave Namusanya","Governance and Local Development Institute; University of Gothenburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University","Governance and Local Development Institute","University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In policy circles and in academia, a popular solution is to provide opportunities for frequent interaction between newcomers and natives places like schools and neighbourhoods. As it stands, causal evidence of the effect of frequent interaction on various measures of integration (interethnic friendships, political participation, institutional trust) is scant, especially when it comes to longer-term effects. In addition, integration may be helped by positive contextual conditions in schools (i.e. teachers' ethnic background, civics courses) and neighbourhoods (i.e. the presence of public services, the presence of meeting places). In this paper, I study integration dynamics in schools and neighbourhoods. For neighbourhoods, I use panel registry data of the whole Dutch population linked to panel survey data over a period of fifteen years and to an original survey. I study whether changes in neighbourhood composition affect integration, looking both at neighbourhood changes and at individuals who move. Moreover, I leverage quasi-random assignment of neighbours to study the causal effect of neighbour composition on measures of integration. Finally, I look at changes in the quality of public services, and the presence of meeting places. Then, I use social network data from schools in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands to study whether quasi-random assignment to ethnically diverse classrooms fosters friendship formation across ethnic divides. I also look at its long-term effects, and at the effect of teacher ethnicity and changes in civics curricula.","Keywords: Immigrant integration, social networks, trust, political participation","Jona de Jong","Jona de Jong",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, at some point, these subsidies should be phased out. The key question is: how can this be done without significantly dampening demand for these technologies? I examine the case of Germany, where, without prior notice, the federal government announced on December 16, 2023, that the Umweltbonus—a federal EV subsidy—would no longer apply to vehicles purchased starting December 17, 2023. To assess the impact of this abrupt subsidy withdrawal on EV sales, I constructed a panel dataset with monthly EV sales across all German Landkreise (counties). Using a regression discontinuity design, the results indicate that the removal of the Umweltbonus led to an immediate decline in EV sales of 65.5 cars per Landkreis, amounting to approximately 26,200 EVs nationwide. This represents a 36% drop in monthly EV sales compared to the pre-removal period. Exploratory analysis reveals that the decline in EV sales was notably smaller in counties with a high Green Party vote share, highlighting the role of environmental preferences in sustaining demand during the transition. Additional analysis is underway to explore the role of local county-level institutions in mitigating the negative effects of subsidy withdrawal.","Keywords: electric vehicles, Germany, green party, subsidy withdrawal, green transition","Stefano Jud","Stefano Jud",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Wyss Academy for Nature (University of Bern)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0178_1141_0330.html","Don't be Fueled: How decarbonization threatens political stability in today's petrostates","Because oil and gas are often associated with conflict, many observers expect the transition away from fossil fuels to yield peaceful benefits. However, there are also dangers lurking on the horizon, especially relating to the political stability of major oil and gas producing countries who rely on fossil fuel rents to maintain social order and legitimate their rule. Without the continued inflow of fossil fuel revenues, government spending has to be cut which could lead to protests, increased repression and even state collapse. To test whether these fears are legitimate, this paper tests the level of political violence of petrostates during previous periods of decline. Although some troubling signs exist at the national level, I argue that we need to focus on the sub-national level in order to grasp the true dangers. Using new data on oil and gas wealth and the geo-location of oil fields and pipelines, the analysis is able to delve deeper into the different mechanisms and explanations linking lower fossil fuel rents to political instability. The results show that petrostates overall face an increased level of civil conflict during times of decline. This increased risk of conflict takes places outside of the main oil-producing areas which have so far been at the focal point of the oil-conflict nexus.","Keywords: Conflict, Energy Transition, Petrostates, Decline.","Yaron Weissberg","Yaron Weissberg",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0179_0678_0403.html","The Electoral Effects of the Disruption of Local Democratic Institutions in Vichy France: an RDD approach","How does the disruption of democratic institutions affect voters’ behaviour once democracy is restored? I answer this question by looking at the uneven repression of elected town councils in Vichy. Due to limited capacity, the Pétain government could not consolidate its territorial control by sending loyal administrators to each municipality. Only towns with a population above 2,000 inhabitants had their mayors replaced. I thus exploit an RDD to highlight the effects of this heterogeneity in democratic disruption onto voters’ behaviour after the restoration of democracy. By looking at the results of the 1945 legislative elections, I find that, in treated municipalities, the MRP – the main non-leftist resistance party – obtained an average 4 p.p. increase in its vote share vis-à-vis municipalities below the cut-off. I find a corresponding contraction in the support for the Radical Party and the Alliance Démocratique, parties not directly linked to the resistance. Interestingly, I find no effect for the Communist and Socialist Parties. This is – I argue – because left-wing parties’ officials (mayors included) were purged regardless of the population cut-off, which explains the absence of significant local effects. Insofar as the mechanisms, I show how a greater degree of democratic repression likely triggered more fierce resistance. In turn, such more intense resistance experience translated into more support for resistance parties, and preferences for resistance parties materialised into electoral support for the ideologically closest resistance party, that is, in relatively less left-wing municipalities, the MRP.","Keywords: Repression, democracy, resistance, autocracy, control","Tommaso Giulla","Tommaso Giulla",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0180_1541_0932.html","International Organisations as Brokers in Global Public Policy","Since the Second World War, global politics has been centred around Western liberal principles. International Organisations (IOs) are guardians of this liberal international order (LIO), ranging from the United Nations to World Trade Organisation, aiming to promote liberal democracy, human rights, rule of law and open markets. Although there has been significant attention to the recent decline of the LIO, this body of work overlooks the key position of IOs in it. In this paper, we study the brokering role of IOs in the field of migration and ask: To what extent do IOs need to broker between competing actors and their competing agendas? With the support of Discourse Network Analysis (DNA), an application of social network analysis (SNA) to policy debates, we map actor coalitions and their proposed policies in the debate on migration to Europe between 2000 and 2020 in a novel dataset of 12,700 coded statements from international press agency reports. Based on Relational Event Models, and a battery of controls based on actor activity and concept popularity, we find that IOs mediate between governments and NGOs as well as their competing agendas such as security interests and human rights in the global migration debate. However, we also show that moments of perceived crisis bring the IOs closer to governments, jeopardising key moral principles of the LIO such as human rights. These findings have important implications for the global governance of migration.","Keywords: Liberal International Order, global governance, International Organisations, migration politics, discourse network analysis","Tim Hen","Ozlem Atikcan","University of Warwick"," Tim Hen","University of Warwick"," Sofie Roehrig","University of Warwick","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Warwick",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While previous research has analyzed the influence of informal rules on politics, the question of how such norms emerge remains largely unexamined. This paper presents a tractable accountability model that explains the emergence and impact of political bright lines. The theory shows how crossing bright lines provides citizens and politicians with informational signals about a leader's quality and potential autocratic preferences. However, the stability and efficiency of these norms vary: highly restrictive lines are often uninformative and short-lived, while overly loose lines are long-lived but inefficient. Bright lines of intermediate restrictiveness are most likely to persist. The paper also examines the strategic establishment of bright lines in constitutional design. The findings hold implications for understanding the interplay between formal and informal institutions, the dynamics of institutional development and stability, and the risks of democratic backsliding.","Keywords: Political Norms, Bright Lines, Institutions, Formal Model, Backsliding","Daniel Goldstein","Daniel Goldstein",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While prior research highlights the ideological and positional effects of radical-right parties’ institutional success (Bischof and Wagner 2019), their potential influence on affective dynamics among voters remains theoretically underdeveloped and empirically underexplored. We hypothesize that the entry of a radical right party produces distinct short- and long-term effects on partisans throughout the system: supporters of the new radical party experience legitimization effects, while opposing voters display a temporary unity effect, fostering greater sympathy among themselves.Using interrupted time-series analysis and synthetic control methods, we analyze time-series cross-sectional data from Germany. Our study focuses on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) entry into the Bundestag in 2017 and earlier entries into regional parliaments. We also investigate the Green Party’s entry into the Bundestag in 1983 for further robustness.The findings indicate that entry into parliament led AfD voters to increase their sympathy towards other parties, perhaps reflecting magnanimous reactions to institutional recognition. Non-AfD voters at most maintained their low sympathy towards the party, but often experience a short-term unity effect, with increased affect towards each other. While the results are largely consistent between the regional and national cases, some differences are present, while the entry of the Greens in 1983 had no clear impact.This study advances the understanding of how radical-right electoral success can shape affective polarization and impact social harmony in societies.","Keywords: Radical right parties, affective polarization, synthetic control method","Alexander Dalheimer","Alexander Dalheimer","University of Vienna"," Markus Wagner","University of Vienna","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0183_1436_0598.html","Who deserves recognition? How the discrepancy between perceived and desirable changes to the social hierarchy relates to vote choice","Normative evaluations of how societies are changing have been found to be at the heart of explaining recent electoral transformations. Notably, supporters of radical right and left parties are characterized by a deep sense of pessimism about the future of society, beyond egotropic worries about their own position. However, we lack evidence on which specific developments are perceived as pointing in the wrong direction. In this paper, we argue that changes to the social status hierarchy are at the core of the pessimism underlying radical voting. If voters' perceptions of actual changes to the social order contrast with their normative beliefs on who deserves social status or recognition, this can explain their political disaffection. We use open-ended survey questions, fielded in an original survey in Germany, to assess people's normative evaluations of changes to the social hierarchy. Using word embeddings, we estimate the discrepancy between voters' ideal and their actually perceived notions of changing social orders. Descriptively, we find that some groups are quite universally deemed to deserve more (workers, women) or less recognition (politicians, the rich). However, we also detect clear differences between socially progressive and conservative voters on the deservingness of natives, migrants, sexual minorities or academics. Furthermore, regression analyses of our word embedding scores show that clear ideas of 'undeserving winners' tend to predict both radical right and left voting. In contrast, worries about 'more deserving losers' or underprivileged groups are aligned with radical left - but not right - voting.","Keywords: Social status, radical voting, societal pessimism, open-ended survey questions, word embeddings","Magdalena Breyer","Magdalena Breyer","University of Basel; University of Zurich","Tabea Palmtag","University of Zurich","Delia Zollinger","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Basel","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, studies rarely engage with the democratic preferences and minorities and fail to consider democracy as a multifaceted concept, combining majoritarian decision-making with counter-majoritarian rights protection. This article argues that ethnic minorities view democracy in light of their position within the polity. Their democratic preferences are not unidimensional, but rather depend on the specific aspect of democracy. The article investigates four core tenets of democracy: electoral democracy, liberal democracy, social rights, and people rule; as well as three oppositions to democracy: populism, illiberalism, and authoritarianism. The article demonstrates that minorities differ in their focus on distinct aspects of democracy. Minorities with a more precarious association to the majority-dominated state – eastern European historical minorities and western European Muslims – are particularly concerned about liberal democracy and social rights, while being more hesitant about electoral and popular democracy. Minorities more rooted within the existing state – western European historical minorities – show lower concern for democracy in general.","Keywords: ethnic minorities, democracy, historical minorities, muslim minorities, populism, illiberalism, authoritarianism","Jan Rovny","Jan Rovny","Sciences Po"," Elena Cossu","Sciences Po"," Luis Sattelmayer","Sciences Po","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Efforts at cross-context knowledge accumulation range from meta-analyses of studies that differ widely in design to harmonized initiatives that implement nearly identical experiments. Recent formal analyses have emphasized the value of harmonization, although this runs against intuitions that lead researchers to introduce heterogeneity intentionally for robustness. We use a decision-theoretic framework to resolve this apparent contradiction and understand the conditions under which cross-study harmonization versus diversification of research designs improves learning. We consider learning about a mean effect from a global distribution and learning about how effects differ across locations. Under a minimax regret objective, we show that diversification is useful because it maximizes precision for learning about a mean effect and manages ambiguity about potential biases. The benefit of harmonization comes from the ability to make more precise comparisons of effects in situations where bias concerns are secondary. The analysis has implications for other design questions, such as the choice of outcome measures. Our minimax regret analysis follows recent work in econometrics and offers an introduction for political scientists.","Keywords: Research design, causal inference, decision theory, minimax regret, experiments","Cyrus Samii","Cyrus Samii","New York University"," Anna Wilke","New York University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research shows that voters tend to prefer parties that use intraparty democracy and evaluate candidates emerging out of democratic procedures better, however, this research assumes that intraparty democracy holds its promise of a democratic procedure. In this paper, we explicitly test how voters evaluate parties and their trust in them depending on whether intraparty democratic follow democratic procedures. We argue that voters should express lower trust in parties and a lower likelihood to vote for them if parties violate principles of competitiveness, participation, and if the decision was reached through a process with a low participation rate.

While existing research highlights how EU-related conflict correlates with public attitudes toward European integration, the effects on voting preferences specifically within EP elections remain underexplored. To address this, we adopt a longitudinal perspective, combining manifesto and survey data to calculate EU issue polarization at the political system level, and how this conflict moderates the influence of individual-level variables on voter preferences in EP elections. Building on previous findings that parties often drive EU issue polarization to broaden their appeal beyond the traditional left–right spectrum (De Vries, 2007), we investigate whether EU issue salience affects EP electoral dynamics in different countries. While highly polarised cases such as the UK are well known, we study these effects across a number of countries and elections to identify the nature of these party-voter relationships in a range of contexts. This research contributes to the literature on the politicisation of European integration by clarifying how EU issue polarisation interacts with individual variables, thus enhancing our understanding of its role in shaping voting behaviour in EP elections.","Keywords: European Union, Party Manifestos, Electoral Behaviour, Euroscepticism, Survey Research, European Parliament","Rosa M.

Governments have responded to such rising challenges by more closely scrutinizing and even cracking down on foreign-owned social media apps. We investigate the attitudes of American citizens toward government intervention to regulate foreign social media apps amidst heightened geopolitical and economic competition. We posit that concerns that the presence of foreign social media in the U.S. may enhance the app home country’s economic and political influence may be an important factor influencing individual attitudes toward foreign social media use. Accordingly, we expect national security and regime concerns, as well as considerations about the social media app’s disinformation potential and economic effects to influence individual support for government decisions to ban foreign social media. The results from a conjoint analysis conducted in November 2024 with 1,500 respondents corroborate our expectations: apps that pose low risks to U.S. military/intelligence or corporate interests, fully independent ones, and those from democratic regimes, with content moderation policies, or have job creation potentials are less likely to be targeted for bans. Privacy protection and reciprocity also matter. Sub-groups analysis (e.g., by partisan orientation or age) shows that the results are robust, pointing to a surprisingly strong “hidden consensus” about what to ban.

Integrating both perspectives, I argue that women are less supportive of anti-democratic policies than men but their expressed objection hinges on partisan cross-pressures. Analyzing surveys from backsliding episodes in Poland, Israel, and the US, I show that women who voted for the government are less approving of its anti-democratic policies than male co-partisans, yet avoid the issue rather than voice discontent against party lines. Conversely, opposition-voting women, whose gender and partisan interests align, voice clear objection like co-partisan men.

We exploit a novel database from archival records detailing all women who were local councilors and mayors in the final years of the Francoist period. The results show that the presence of women local politicians under an autocratic regime paved the path for an early entry of women into democratic politics after the regime transition.

Can the visible engagement of clearly identifiable moderators in comment sections - what we call ‘active moderation’ - improve online discourse? Together with the Swiss online newspaper 20Minuten, we run a randomized field experiment testing the efficacy of such visible moderation. We use an experimental design in which 20Minuten moderators identify articles they deem at risk for harmful comments and randomize them into two categories – one control group, which experiences the usual invisible moderation (deleting harmful comments before publication), and one treatment group, in which moderators additionally engage visibly in the comments section, responding to both constructive and potentially harmful comments. We find that active moderation reduces both the number and the share of toxic comments submitted; moreover, it does so without reducing engagement. We show that this reduction in toxicity is entirely due to behavioral change among users, rather than selection of less toxic users into actively moderated articles.","Keywords: Content moderation, harmful speech, media","Laura Bronner","Laura Bronner","ETH Zürich"," Nicolai Berk","ETH Zürich"," Francisco Tomás-Valiente","ETH Zürich"," Dominik Hangartner","ETH Zürich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0194_2354_1276.html","Participation after Turnout: the Effects of Electoral Rules on Blank and Null Voting in Italy (1960-1970) and Poland (2010-2024)","Empirical literature has primarily studied the effects of electoral systems on ‘ballot box’ turnout: the number of votes cast divided by the number of eligible voters. However, changes in the share of blank and null votes associated with variation in electoral rules are often as large as electoral system effects on ‘ballot box’ turnout. I present evidence in this sense by re-analysing existing regression discontinuity (RD) studies that leverage population-based threshold in local electoral rules, showing that substantive inferences on the relationship between electoral rules and participation may be substantively overturned, depending on whether we consider ‘ballot box’ or ‘valid’ turnout. I theorise that blank voting can be conceptualised as ‘voluntary’ non-voting, due to voters not finding suitable options on the ballot paper, whereas null voting expresses ‘involuntary’ non-voting, due to voters filling out their ballot incorrectly. Leveraging local election returns from Italy (1960-1970) and Poland (2010-2024), I leverage population-based discontinuities in electoral rules, as well as exogenous electoral system reforms (in 1964 and 2011 respectively) to test the implications of this framework. I find that the occurrence of blank voting is significantly lower when electoral rules increase the number of parties that enter electoral competition, while ballot complexity increases the occurrence of null voting. In both case studies, it emerges that the effects of electoral rules on ‘voluntary’ non-voting are more pronounced in high-education locales, while the effects of electoral rules ‘involuntary’ non-voting are stronger in low-education locales. I conclude by discussing normative implications for designing inclusive electoral rules.","Keywords: Electoral Systems, Regression Discontinuity, Turnout, Participation, Proportional Representation","Leonardo Carella","Leonardo Carella",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Nuffield College, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0195_0815_1340.html","Inter-ethnic variation in public opinion in autocracies: Evidence from Russia","Members of ethnic minority groups are among those most likely to be dissatisfied with authoritarian political regimes. They are often excluded from political power and may face discrimination or unwelcome pressures to assimilate; legacies of discrimination and unequal development may have resulted in their geographic concentration in economically disadvantaged areas. However, assessing the political preferences of members of these groups is difficult. Substantial inter- and intra-ethnic variation in political preferences makes it hard to gather – or even conceptualize – a representative sample. Moreover, preference falsification is particularly likely among members of minority groups, since concerns about repression may make them particularly unwilling to reveal negative sentiment about the government. In this paper, I use original survey data from Russia to assess public opinion and preference falsification among minority populations, finding evidence of substantial inter-ethnic variation in different metrics of regime support.","Keywords: Russian politics, Ethnic politics, Preference falsification, Survey experiments, Authoritarianism","Kyle Marquardt","Kyle Marquardt",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Bergen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0196_2655_0029.html","Gendered School Experiences and Populism among Adolescents","Men – in particular: young men – are more likely than women to hold populist attitudes and to vote for radical right parties, which has fueled the rise of those parties across established democracies. Research on gender gaps in populist attitudes mostly explains these with reference to mens’ economic grievances and cultural value change. We contribute to these studies with a focus on experiences in adolescence, which is known to be a formative period for the development of political attitudes and opinions. More concretely, we argue that males’ propensity to develop populist attitudes – or: anti-liberal attitudes more generally – is crucially influenced by their experiences in schools. In schools, they interact with street-level bureaucrats – teachers – on a daily basis, most of whom nowadays are women. In addition, the stereotypical behaviors of boys are less conducive to academic performance than those of girls, resulting in boys being admonished more often and getting worse grades. Feeling treated more unfairly in school and lacking male role models, we argue that boys are more likely than girls to develop anti-liberal attitudes. We empirically test these claims with data from a large-N survey of 7th graders in three German Bundesländer that includes several measures of unfairness perceptions and a number of second-dimension attitudes. First analyses suggest that boys indeed are more likely to feel treated unfairly in school than girls, and that perceptions of unfairness are more negatively related to attitudes towards democracy and gender equality among boys than among girls.","Keywords: populism, education, political socialization, gender","Staffan Kumlin","Susanne Garritzmann","University of Konstanz; Goethe University Frankfurt","Marius Busemeyer","Goethe University Frankfurt","Staffan Kumlin","University of Oslo","Nadja Wehl","Goethe University Frankfurt","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","Goethe University Frankfurt","University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0197_0636_1221.html","Manufacturing Obedience: How Authoritarian Leaders Establish Stability","The literature on authoritarian regimes has largely focused on how authoritarian regimes manage to remain in power. But this begs the question of how these regimes can establish stability to begin with. It is not self-evident how a ruling minority is able to convince larger parts of the population to commit to the new regime. I study this question in the hard case of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The newly created communist regime was imposed onto a population that stood under large influence of national socialism where communism has been one of the main ideological targets. Using GDR census data, I analyze how three major regime strategies – indoctrination (teachers), economic benefits (housing) and repression (military bases) - were deployed to create obedience towards the new regime. To identify the effects more precisely, I leverage differences across local party elites and their links to the government, proxying the access to resources. Given the issues surrounding measuring obedience in authoritarian regimes, I use fine-grained data on criminal records in the GDR to scrutinize the relationship between authoritarian control strategies and different types of crimes. While control strategies are supposed to reduce the number of crimes, they might also create opposition towards the regime. First evidence suggests that economic benefits decrease the number of crimes, while there is no relationship with higher doses of indoctrination or repression. This paper offers new insights on the origins of authoritarian regimes and displays how they address early challenges.","Keywords: HPE, GDR, Communism, Authoritarian Stability, Authoritarian Elites","Ludwig Schulze","Ludwig Schulze",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The roots of this perspective can be located in Max Weber's pioneering work that emphasizes the principles of bureaucratic rationality and meritocracy. But do even bureaucracies that are most closely aligned with Weber's perspective really follow such a clear merit-based logic? Highlighting the critical roles of cognitive limitations and social affection in promotion and hiring decisions, we develop a theory that suggests that even in highly formalized modern bureaucracies that are subject to performance-inducing external pressures, prestige and personal connections remain central to bureaucratic careers. We subsequently test this theory with the extreme case of top-level promotions in a highly formalized military bureaucracy subject to intense war-related pressures in the form of the German Wehrmacht during World War II.","Keywords: Historical political economy, modern bureaucracies, state apparatus, World War 2, military","Jan P.

"abstract_0199_2143_0127.html","Monopolizing Clientelism During Regime Transition: Implications on Regime Stability","How do autocratic regimes regulate clientelism during their consolidation? What are the impacts of their regulations on regime stability? This paper investigates the -overlooked- role of clientelistic institutions and their regulation during regime transitions towards autocratic rule.  During autocratization, the opposition could utilize its clientelistic networks to mobilize against the new regime. To inhibit the opposition, the emerging regime might pursue a monopoly over the provision of clientelistic services by restricting non-state providers of clientelism. I argue that these discriminatory restrictions would boost the opposition's mobilization in the early phase of the transition, but this effect would dissipate and shift in favor of the regime as it consolidates power. I relate these changes to the regulations' informational functions. Empirically, I test this argument using an original district-level dataset of Islamist charities (i.e., clientelistic institutions) in Egypt (2012-2015) during its regime transition. The findings show that the new regime's crackdown on Islamist charities boosted pro-Islamist (anti-transition) mobilization during the transition's early phase. However, these effects disappeared with the regime's consolidation. Even more, dismantling the opposition's clientelistic machine enabled the regime to coopt their clients and shift their loyalties toward the new regime. Thus, the pursuit of clientelistic monopolies might backfire in the short term, but stabilize the new regime in the medium/long term.","Keywords: clientelism, authoritarianism, regime transition, MENA politics, protest","Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed","Ahmed Ezzeldin Mohamed",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, Toulouse School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0200_2653_0098.html","The life cycle of non-partisan PMs","Over the period from 1945 until 2024, 988 cabinets were built in 30 European democracies. Out of these, 80 were headed by non-partisan prime ministers (PMs). The article deals with four major research questions. The first is why non-partisan PMs are appointed in some democracies but not in others. We demonstrate that constitutional factors strongly affect the appointment of non-partisan PMs. Specifically, in systems where PMs or presidents have powers to directly influence cabinet formation and termination, there are either no or very few non-partisan PMs.The second research question is under which circumstances in which non-partisan PMs are appointed. Our findings demonstrate to show that non-partisan PMs’ appointments are more likely likelier during long-term economic growth than during economic recession, after public opinion shocks, but also in fractionalized party systems, and towards the end of the legislative term. Our third research question examines the duration of non-partisan PMs’ careers in comparison to partisan ones. We show that non-partisan PMs have shorter cabinet careers than those of partisan PMs. However, we also examined post-cabinet career trajectories of all 53 non-partisan PMs in our sample to better understand the possible reasons for these short career durations. Against a widespread assumption that non-partisan PMs are parachuted in and then leave politics, we find that the opposite is actually true.  Most of them remain in political roles as national- and regional-level politicians or become party leaders.","Keywords: nonpartisan; presidential power; prime ministers; cabinet formation; ministerial appointments","Elena Semenova","Elena Semenova","Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne"," Keith Dowding","Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne"," Andre Kaiser","Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite this, few studies have systematically examined the effects of increases in information availability on voting behavior. Using data on exposure to radio coverage in Ghana, I investigate the relationship between radio coverage and volatility of voting choices between 2004 and 2020. Employing a Two-way-fixed-effects model and Gardner's Difference-in-Differences approach, I find that greater radio coverage reduces vote volatility, suggesting that voters show greater stability in their voting preferences. Further analysis reveals that this effect is primarily driven by commercial radio stations. I explain that through their need to attract the audience while having capacities to present nationally relevant information. This study contributes to the literature on information provision and voting behavior by empirically demonstrating how increased information availability influences voters' preferences and subsequently reduces electoral volatility. Additionally, it advances research on media effects by highlighting the role of commercial media in shaping electoral outcomes.","Keywords: Political Economy, Media, Voting behavior, Ghana, Information, Causal Inference","Anna Sawallisch","Anna Sawallisch",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt-University Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0202_1558_0550.html","The Unseen Divide: Analyzing Disparities in Perceived Ethnic Majority-Minority Conflicts Among Immigrants and Non-Immigrants in Germany","Previous research on integration of immigrants highlights a significant yet often overlooked gap in the perception of discrimination, whereby immigrants and ethnic minorities report considerably higher levels of discrimination, while the majority population severely underestimates the extent of discrimination experienced by these groups. This, in turn, may lead to additional conflicts as these minority groups feel marginalized and majority groups refrain from supporting measures that reduce inequality. This paper makes a novel contribution to the literature on perceptions of discrimination by highlighting this often-overlooked gap and systematically examining its underlying determinants. Empirically, we utilize a unique and fine-grained geo-coded panel survey situated in Germany that oversamples immigrants from predominantly Islamic countries – groups that are particularly prone to experience discrimination. The results show that immigrants perceive higher levels of harassment and violence toward ethnic minorities than non-immigrants, while this gap is largely explained by different levels of discrimination experiences. Results from longitudinal two-way fixed effects panel models demonstrate that sustained and meaningful contact between immigrants and non-immigrants significantly reduces perceptions that intergroup relations are conflictual for both immigrants and non-immigrants. In addition, an increase in physical and social disorder increases conflict perceptions. These findings have important implications for place-based approaches to immigrant integration and policy measures that are aimed at enhancing social cohesion.","Keywords: Perception of Discrimination, Integration of Immigrants, Social Cohesion, Intergroup Relations, Minority-Majority Relations, Immigrants Integration Policy","Naman Rawat, Conrad Ziller","Naman Rawat","Stockholm University","Conrad Ziller","University of Duisburg-Essen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stockholm University","University of Duisburg-Essen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research shows that environmentally friendly parties face electoral backlash when citizens bear the direct costs of climate transition. We take a step back and analyse how risk affects individuals’ evaluations of future climate policies, such as banning polluting heating systems. We define risk not as the ability to bear costs but as individuals' control over future expenses. We argue that, holding costs constant, opposition to climate policies depends on risk when individuals cannot control the timing of future costs. As individuals transition from fossil-fueled to renewable heating systems, higher risk perceptions decrease support for intrusive energy policies. We test this argument by examining owners of polluting heating systems in Germany using novel cross-sectional data on building stock and attitudes toward the heating transition. Using an instrumental variable, we find that owners perceiving higher risk are less likely to support asset bans. Preliminary evidence suggests homeowners and wealthier individuals drive this effect. Our findings emphasize the role of risk in the energy transition, indicating that support for climate policies can increase if individuals have greater control over future policy-related costs.","Keywords: climate policy; prospective voting; political behaviour; wealth","Martin Alberdi","Martin Alberdi","European University Institute"," Ludwig Schulze","European University Institute","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies on globalized food supply chains have led to significant theoretical causal links between food supply shocks in food exporting economies and the preconditions of internal conflict such as poverty, inflation, and unequal state support in importing markets.The goal of this study is to test whether climate-induced food supply chain shocks in major food exporting markets exacerbate socio-economic preconditions for conflict (poverty, food inflation, growth) in food-importing markets, as well as whether the effects materializes into direct conflict variables such as protests or intrastate conflict intensity.The study uses quarterly panel data from 2005 to 2018 on natural disasters, food trade, national food inflation, GDP growth, protests count and conflict-related deaths by country. Countries are then classified as food exporters, importers or autonomous depending on their net food imports relative to their total imports. A two-way fixed effects analysis and then a staggered difference in difference analysis are applied to determine the difference in effect of climate shocks in major food exporters between food importers, exporters and autonomous markets.","Keywords: climate change, food supply chains, conflict, diff-in-diff, protests, trade, climate-conflict nexus, globalization","Jesus Antonio Renzullo Narvaez","Jesus Antonio Renzullo Narvaez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"German Institute of Global Area StudiesUniversität Hamburg (UHH)Cluster of Excellence on Climate, Climate Change and Society (CLICCS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0205_2693_0933.html","State Influence on UN Multilateral Aid through Bureaucratic Ties","Do states benefit from having their nationals on the staff of international organizations (IOs) and, if so, how? We know that states seek to get their nationals hired into senior positions at IOs, but the reasons behind this are less well-understood. In addition, we know much less about attempts by member states to place their nationals in staff-level positions in IOs. I show that the policy preferences of IOs are more similar to those countries that have many of their nationals employed at the IO. In addition, I find that not all countries have an equal ability to get their nationals hired by IOs. Examining an original dataset on UN staff nationalities, I show that major donors to voluntarily-funded UN development agencies have a larger number of their nationals on staff than do similar non-major donors. I further demonstrate that those agencies' aid portfolios look more similar to countries that have a large number of their nationals on the agency's staff. Interestingly, this effect is not solely driven by those countries that existing theories of informal influence would lead us to believe should be most influential---namely the G5---but also by other, less powerful, bilateral donors. This suggests that a much larger number of countries can informally influence IOs than is generally thought.","Keywords: united nations, financing, staffing","Svanhildur Thorvaldsdottir","Svanhildur Thorvaldsdottir",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Iceland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Political entrepreneurs advertently engineer these shifts. How and when do political entrepreneurs manage to reshape entire cleavage structures and to make salient new identities? We develop a formal model of endogenous identity politics in which voters form beliefs about their ingroup and outgroup stereotypes before making an electoral choice between a normal and an authoritarian candidate. We show that political entrepreneurs push outgroup stereotypes among ingroup members rather than reshaping ingroup stereotypes. Shifts occur if political entrepreneurs from opposing camps seek to amplify extreme beliefs about their respective outgroups. If elected, the authoritarian candidate exploits this polarized environment to undermine democracy.

"abstract_0207_0258_0499.html","Cross-partisan co-sponsoring in parliamentary systems","Co-sponsoring of policy proposals has received limited scholarly attention in the context of parliamentary systems, where the legislative process is heavily dominated by the government and the vast majority of enacted policies are initially proposed by the cabinet. In this study, we analyze why cross-partisan co-sponsoring of private member bills occurs in parliamentary systems. We argue that such interparty policy work is significantly more prevalent under minority governments than majority governments, as parliamentary cooperation becomes more necessary and the likelihood of success increases. Furthermore, we contend that cross-partisan co-sponsoring is influenced by both MP's ideological proximity on the issue and the salience of the policy. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset on private member bills in the Norwegian parliament combined with individual MP characteristics, we test these arguments empirically. First, we show, through network analyses, that MPs are far more likely to co-sponsor bills across parties during periods of minority governments than majority governments. Second, we scale PMBs to pre-defined text embedding centroids based on party programs to show that cross-party co-sponsorship is favored over single party sponsorship on salient issues where MPs are ideologically proximate. Finally, we utilize within-period cabinet restructuring to show how MPs utilize PMBs to build coalitions in parliament before entering cabinet.

"abstract_0208_1572_0597.html","Production Workers and Left Electoral Support: The Selective Decline of Class Voting in Contemporary Western Europe (2000-2023)","Over the decades, numerous scholarly contributions have attested to a historical decline in the association between working-class voters and electoral support for left parties in Western Europe. Did this enduring process extend into the new millennium? This paper seeks answers by leveraging representative survey data from multiple waves of the European Social Survey (ESS), covering 19 Western European countries in 2000-2023. Its aim is twofold: describing contemporary patterns of working-class voting in contemporary Western Europe, and assessing their determinants. First, by operationalising the working class through Oesch’s scheme of labour market location, data shows that whilst the electoral support of the working class did not significantly decline in the aggregate, ‘traditional’ production workers (e.g., in factories) kept progressively abandoning the left over the past two-and-a-half decades. Second, moving from this finding, the paper tests relevant hypotheses concerning individuals’ sociodemographics and attitudes, party supply, descriptive representation, and deunionisation in multilevel analyses. Overall, the association between production workers and electoral support for the left is reinforced in those contexts where this social group is especially lower-educated, straight, and urban, and with stronger trade unions. When replicating the analyses by specifically including only those countries in which production workers’ vote for class-bloc parties has declined, the fundamental role of party supply emerges. In particular, production workers are significantly less likely to vote for left parties if, compared to themselves, these formations are more economically right-wing, as well as when cultural issues (e.g., immigration, crime, etc.) are more polarised within national party systems.","Keywords: Working class, class voting, left parties, survey data, contemporary Western Europe","Federico Trastulli","Federico Trastulli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Verona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines how terror attacks reshaped political discourse on multiculturalism in France between 2014 and 2021. By analysing 143,870 tweets from major political parties, the research investigates how far-right narratives relate to mainstream political communication. The paper is based on a novel dataset of tweets collected in the framework of the ANONYMIZED project. We track the salience and sentiment of multiculturalism-related discussions across political parties by using a XLM-RoBERTa model using Natural Language Inference to classify texts. The findings reveal significant shifts in political discourse on multiculturalism during terror attacks. We find no clear evidence of salience contagion, where critical events increase the prominence of multiculturalism in political discourse. However, we do observe heightened negative attention to the issue across parties. Following critical events, mainstream parties, particularly right-wing ones, adopted a more negative tone, aligning more closely with far-right positions. A critical mechanism identified is the “civic framing” strategy, where opposition to multiculturalism is framed as a defence of secularism and liberal democratic values by both the far right and the mainstream-right. The findings point to a trend in French politics toward accommodating illiberal discourses, extending beyond the far right. These results also deepen the understanding of how illiberal discourses gain traction in contemporary democracies, particularly during periods of heightened public tension.","Keywords: Discourse, Natural Language Processing, Party Communication","Elena Cossu","Elena Cossu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I end with the construction of panel datasets measuring two types of illicit industries across Nigeria, Africa's largest country: illicit mining and informal road transport; as well as an R package intended to extend the dataset to other cases. I conclude with some analysis of these datasets, which suggests that the timing of informal industry enforcement at the subnational level depends on the nature of local political networks.","Keywords: Informality; West Africa; Quantitative Methods; Geospatial data; Comparative Politics of Low Income Countries","Melissa Pavlik","Melissa Pavlik",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Melissa Pavlik",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Autocratic Interference and Democratic Backsliding","The paper examines whether external interference by autocratic regimes in democracies contributes to democratic backsliding. External autocratic interference can function as backsliding promotion and increase domestic anti-democratic actors’ capacities. Where anti-democratic actors are in government, backsliding promotion takes the form of supportive interference, strengthening the backslider government; where they are in opposition, disruptive interference weakens the government and strengthens anti-democratic opposition actors. Differentiating supportive and disruptive strategies also allows me to draw inference on the sender’s objectives: if support systematically coincides with backslider governments, and disruption with backslider oppositions, I argue that senders indeed intend to promote backsliding. I use Bayesian modelling to test both claims. I use V-Dem data to measure democratic regression and the role of anti-democratic parties in government and opposition, and operationalize autocratic support and disruption via autocratic foreign direct investment (FDI) in and sanctions of democracies, respectively. In a two-step analysis, I estimate the (1) effect of anti-democratic government and opposition parties on the level of autocratic FDI and sanctions; and (2) the effect of autocratic FDI and sanctions, conditional on anti-democratic government and opposition parties, on democratic backsliding. Preliminary findings provide support for the argument that autocracies interfere in democracies to promote backsliding, and that they increase backsliding if they do.","Keywords: Democratic regression, autocratic regimes, external interference, Bayesian models","Alexander Schmotz","Alexander Schmotz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"WZB Berlin Social Science Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditional explanations for the gender gap are built on three pillars: unequal resource distribution, the underrepresentation of women in politics, and psychological factors that alienate women from the political realm. This research contributes to the literature by integrating insights from these grand theories and examining the moment the gap begins to emerge: when girls and boys develop their political attitudes. Unequal resource benefits theory suggests that after gaining access to education and work, men and women benefit differently from these resources. Psychological perspectives, particularly gendered political socialization, argue that women are socialized to view politics as male-dominated. This study investigates whether, given the same family structure, measured by parents' educational level and occupational status, the development of political efficacy differs for boys and girls over the lifecycle. Using 10 years of panel data with household structure from the British Household Panel, the preliminary analysis reveals that while both boys and girls benefit from higher parental resources, girls experience significantly smaller gains. By framing these findings within lifecycle and socialization dynamics, this paper sheds light on how structural and psychological factors intersect to sustain gendered patterns of political behaviour","Keywords: gender gap, political behaviour, socialization, youth, family","Lidia Núñez","Lidia Núñez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0215_1148_1063.html","Bridging the Turnout and Conservative Gender Gaps: Analysing Women’s Electoral Participation in Early Spanish Democracy","This paper examines the socio-demographic characteristics of newly enfranchised groups, focusing on women. Previous research has addressed this topic using aggregated data, risking ecological fallacies when inferring individual behaviour. I overcome this limitation by analysing newly available, fine-grained historical electoral data on individual socio-demographic characteristics. The dataset covers voters during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939), the first time women were granted the right to vote in Spain and includes electoral results at the district level. My research expands on the literature on the turnout gender gap by identifying which groups of women, if any, tended to vote at lower rates than men. It also investigates the role of family dynamics, such as sibling relationships, in shaping voting behaviour. Specifically, it examines whether the presence of female family members influenced individuals’ likelihood of voting in subsequent elections. The findings reveal a positive influence of older sisters on younger sisters’ likelihood of voting in elections where they became eligible to vote by age— a pattern not observed among brothers. Finally, the level of disaggregation of the electoral results enables an analysis of women’s ideological preferences by examining population composition by sex and accounting for other socio-demographic characteristics. By addressing limitations in prior research and leveraging detailed historical data, this study sheds light on how women’s participation and preferences were expressed in early elections following enfranchisement. It offers valuable insights into the interplay between gender, family structures, and political behaviour during a transformative period in electoral history.","Keywords: gender norms;  political behaviour; women’s suffrage; democratisation; women's enfranchisement","Magalí Serra Duran","Magalí Serra Duran",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0216_1357_1096.html","Exploring the Dynamics of Human Rights Attitudes: Outgroup Perception and Long-term Consequences","People are often willing to restrict human rights, particularly if violations are seen as necessary to maintain security or to restrain an outgroup. But what happens when the public is prompted to consider that restrictions on an outgroup today might be applied to an ingroup down the line? To answer this, we address three related questions: (1) What arguments can strengthen support for basic human rights of others? (2) How much does the answer to this question depend on people’s attitudes towards the right holders? (3) And can support for human rights be strengthened by pointing to potential long-term risks of limiting human rights? We address these questions with novel survey experiments in Germany. We differentiate between different reasons why people might be willing to sacrifice human rights when they see their way of life under threat. We investigate attitudes towards police violence against peaceful protesters, exploring tensions between government restrictions and protections of basic rights. Our study provides an important extension to research on the trade-off between security and human rights at a time of worrying backlash against human rights in an under-studied European context.","Keywords: human rights, public attitudes, survey experiment, protest","Katrin Paula","Sabine Carey","University of Mannheim","Robert Johns","University of Southampton","Nadine O'Shea","Technical University of Munich","Katrin Paula","Technical University of Munich","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical University of Munich","University of Mannheim","University of Southampton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, existing research has not examined the degree to which marginalized identities matter to members of these groups. Drawing on insights from social identity theory, I argue that marginalized individuals' perception that their life's trajectory is connected to those of other group members enhances perceptions that in-group representatives are responsive to their needs. Using original survey data and a factorial survey experiment from the United Kingdom, I show considerable variation in women’s gender consciousness (n = 3,548) and working class individuals’ class consciousness (n = 2,565). I find that individuals with high levels of consciousness perceive stronger improvements in responsiveness as descriptive representation of their in-group increases. These results contribute to the long-standing question whether descriptive representation matters and reveal how marginalized groups' perceptions of democratic institutions hinge on descriptive representation in contexts of a rising emphasise on structural inequalities.","Keywords: descriptive representation, political institutions, legislative politics, social identity","Verena Reidinger","Verena Reidinger",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0218_2154_1142.html","Does preventive content moderation improve online discourse?","Many online platforms use forms of pre-moderation, whereby online contributions are screened - by algorithms, humans or both - with the aim of identifying harmful comments before they are posted. This system has disadvantages: it can be costly, depending on the cost of the human (and/or algorithmic) moderators used, and it can inhibit on-platform interaction by delaying or even preventing the posting of comments, including harmless ones. But does it actually work to reduce harmful comments and improve the quality of online discourse? And what is the trade-off between harmful comments and the costs (financial and otherwise) to the platform? In this study, we partner with the Austrian online newspaper Der Standard to run a randomized field experiment testing the efficacy of algorithmically-supported pre-moderation. In our experimental design, the Community Team at Der Standard randomizes articles into two categories: one treatment group, in which comments are passed through their in-house moderation algorithm, which automatically publishes or deletes most comments and sends the remainder to human moderators, and a control group, in which comments are not systematically pre-screened. We track how submitted and published comments differ between treated and control articles to measure the impact of pre-moderation. We hypothesize that there is a trade-off between preventing harmful speech and encouraging engagement; we expect that pre-moderation reduces harmful speech, but also takes longer, leading to fewer comments and interactions, and requires more resources from the platform.","Keywords: Content moderation, online discourse, media","Laura Bronner","Laura Bronner","ETH Zürich"," Francisco Tomás-Valiente","ETH Zürich"," Nicolai Berk","ETH Zürich"," Dominik Hangartner","ETH Zürich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0219_2387_1275.html","Cherries on Top? Women and Ballot Order","Women’s road to parliament has been long and winding. To this day, women are underrepresented in parliaments worldwide, with detrimental consequences for democratic legitimacy and substantive representation. Understanding women’s underrepresentation requires moving beyond voter-based explanations, such as bias against women candidates. We focus on party elites and candidate selection as key factors in explaining the representational gap. Prominent theories propose that party elites assign women to ‘ornamental positions’ in highly competitive districts or low-probability ballot ranks. We provide a uniquely comprehensive test of the ‘ornamental position’ thesis, collecting novel data covering the universe of Danish national election candidacies from the entire postwar era (1945–2022). This extensive dataset allows us to control for party and election-level characteristics. We focus particularly on the 1950s and 1960s, when many parties used de facto closed lists to nominate candidates, giving local party organizations substantial power over seat allocation. Our results show that women candidates run on less favorable positions overall. However, this gap disappears when considering only within-party variation. Instead, women’s disadvantage stems from women running for parties with long lists and low electoral success. We also find that, conditional on candidate performance, parties do not seem to penalize women with less winnable seats in the subsequent election. These results challenge prevailing theories about the role of party elites in hindering women’s political representation.","Keywords: political representation, electoral systems, party behavior, candidate selection, gender","Olivia V.

Who will they privilege when apportioning economic development? Preliminary results from municipal-level historical data on fascist Italy's flagship agricultural development policy suggest ex-ante politically opposed locations received more resources when they credibly threatened collective action. Decomposing policy outcomes based on geo-morphological characteristics allows the study to focus on the socio-economic component of yield improvements. I then exploit exogenous variation in agricultural strikes due to anomalous rainfall to causally connect unrest to larger productivity gains. Suggestive evidence based on electrification and the location of radio infrastructure similarly indicates that other benefits were allocated to more threatening areas. The case suggests that local revolts against autocrats pay off in the short term but also deliver important information on the misalignment of communities, which the ruling elite can redress through targeted policies.","Keywords: historical, autocracy, unrest, strike, policy","Lorenzo Vicari","Lorenzo Vicari",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0222_1780_0303.html","After the Commons: Economic Opportunity and Colonial Legacies of Land Privatization (HPE_Panel)","European colonial administrations often implemented land settlement programs that privileged property rights over indigenous communal tenure systems. Given the large body of literature that supports private property rights as welfare-enhancing, I examine how British property rights reforms affected inter-generational economic opportunity in the case of Jordan, a British colony from 1921 to 1946. I argue that the conversion of communal tenure into private holdings introduced short-term economic benefits that did not result in inter-generational gains in economic well-being. To test this argument, I leverage variation in the pre-reform proportion of villages' communal tenure to examine individual-level economic well-being after the colonial-era reform.  Using a contemporaneous case study and survey data from the 2016 wave of the Jordan Labor Market Panel Survey (JLMPS), I examine how exposure to the land settlement reform affected individuals' wealth, asset ownership, and educational attainment. In the short term, children from peasant families were increasingly able to attend school due to the capital infusion from land titling. In the decades that followed, however, I find that individuals born in villages with higher levels of historic communal tenure have lower levels of wealth and educational attainment. This paper contributes to our understanding of how colonial legacies may perpetuate inequalities in post-colonial autocracies, and challenges the characterization of private property rights as a prerequisite for development and democratization.","Keywords: State-building, redistribution, historical legacies, colonialism, Middle East","Allison Hartnett","Allison Hartnett",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Southern CaliforniaLondon School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0223_2404_1575.html","Welcome to the Party, Pal: Donors at Political Fundraising Events","Public and scholarly attention on fundraising events often focuses on concerns around selective responsiveness to donors, particularly when those donors may have preferences that are unrepresentative of the broader constituency. These accounts have primarily relied on anecdotal evidence, due largely to a lack of systematic data on event fundraising attendance. We use data from U.S. state-level campaign finance disclosures -- which reveal whether or not a donation was made for attending a fundraising event -- alongside voter files merged to consumer data (L2 Data), as well as national-level surveys to explore consequences of event fundraising for responsiveness. We first examine the representativeness of event donors along lines of income and demographics, compared both to non-event donors and registered voters. Moreover, we analyze the degree of issue alignment between politicians and each comparison group. Furthermore, we examine how exposure to event donors moderates legislators' responsiveness to district preferences. We also analyze the relationship between event-donor exposure and misperceptions of constituents' views. Our preliminary results indicate that event donors are richer, and more likely to be male and white than non-event donors, and that both groups of donors are richer, older, and more likely to be male and white than both the underlying constituency and the state as a whole. Moreover, on economically salient issues, event donors are more likely to be aligned with their member of Congress than non-donors.","Keywords: Campaign finance, fundraising events, representation, responsiveness, politicians' perceptions of constituents' policy views","Sebastian Thieme","Sebastian Thieme","Sciences Po","Sean Kates","University of Pennsylvania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po","University of Pennsylvania",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0224_1855_0227.html","Local climate risk and attitudes towards public climate action: evidence from 259 European regions","Under what conditions do citizens support public action on climate change? We build on comparative political economy arguments that link support for climate policies to individuals' perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with both the effects of climate change itself, and the specific policy aimed at mitigation and adaptation. Our argument builds on the idea of cross-pressured regions and individuals. Regional and individual capacity to a) adapt to climate risks but also b) bear the costs of climate action varies. In the light of increased visibility of the effects of climate change on our daily lives, a systematic comparison of climate risks and climate policy vulnerability beyond regions traditionally scrutinized, such as coastal lines or coal mining heartlands, is warranted. To this end, we integrate the IPCC’s climate risk components (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) into our theoretical framework, facilitating much needed conceptual consistency across disciplines. Empirically, we merge micro-level data from the European Social Survey (2016) with regional-level data on local climate risk from the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (2022) and data on regional economic and social characteristics to employ multilevel models that examine support for public climate action in 259 European regions comparatively. At a time in which governments globally are ramping up their efforts to address a looming climate crisis, the results from our analysis leverage new insights into how the cost of climate change effects and the cost of policy shape acceptance of indispensable public action on climate change.","Keywords: climate change, climate change policies, public opinion, Europe, comparative political economy","Pernilla Söderberg","Pernilla Söderberg","Humboldt Universität zu Berlin"," Hanna Schwander","Humboldt Universität zu Berlin","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The attribution of environmental degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa","Even though African countries are only responsible for less than 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the continent suffers disproportionately from the consequences of climate change. Examples of environmental degradation include deadly heatwaves and heavy rains which can ultimately result in food shortages, the loss of inhabitable grounds, or the enforcement of ongoing conflicts in the region. Meanwhile, the Global Norths accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (92%), resulting in an “emission debt” to other countries. While the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) calls for “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”, it remains a question whether citizens of the most affected regions also blame the Global North for the consequences of environmental degradation. In this paper, I investigate under which circumstances citizensin Sub-Saharan Africa perceive actors of industrialized nations as accountable for grievances related to climate change. I argue that climate change literacy, education, and urbanization but also context-based factors such as state capacity to mitigate climate change, the magnitude of environmental degradation, and the presence of environmental protest shape the perception of individuals. Using fine-grained geo-coded data from the Afrobarometer and novel data on environmental protest, I explore in how far individuals attribute responsibility for environmental degradation to actors of the Global North.","Keywords: climate change, perception, Africa","Rebecca Strauch","Rebecca Strauch",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0226_2569_0469.html","Repression via collective punishment","Collective punishment—punishing individuals for actions committed by others—is often used by repressive regimes. This is puzzling from a rational-choice perspective, because the expectation of being punished ""no matter what"" can make disobedience relatively more appealing. Thus, collective punishment is frequently viewed as a second-best solution for rulers constrained by informational asymmetries. This paper argues that while this conventional wisdom captures the “vertical” dimension of repression—how rulers directly punish citizens—it overlooks the “horizontal” dimension—how rulers can create incentives for citizens to punish each other for disobeying.I formalize this argument with a game-theoretic model in which a ruler maximizes obedience in a heterogenous population. Citizens are embedded in a network, where the intensity of connections reflects how they influence each other's utility after observing obedience decisions. In designing the optimal punishment rule, the ruler faces a trade-off between horizontal and vertical deterrence: collective punishment can incentivize some citizens to punish others for disobeying, thus increasing overall obedience; however, excessive punishment may be counterproductive if citizens believe they will be punished regardless of their action. I provide a general characterization of the optimal punishment rule and the conditions under which it includes collective punishment. Optimal punishment has intuitive properties: more connected citizens are more likely to be punished for each other's disobedience, and rulers employ collective punishment only when disobedience exceeds a certain threshold.","Keywords: collective punishment, repression","Giorgio Farace","Giorgio Farace",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Chicago (doctoral candidate)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0227_2083_0595.html","The Substantive Cues of Candidates’ Class: Insights from Brazil","While the descriptive representation of gender and ethnic identities has been extensively analyzed in recent research, the role of candidates’ class has received much less attention. Candidates often use their class identities, including social origins and occupational and educational backgrounds, as electoral cues on the campaign trail. Existing research highlights that voters value candidates' class markers because of valence considerations such as group affinity and representational qualities. However, we argue that a candidate's class identity also appeals to substantive policy and ideological content. Specifically, we suggest that voters use candidates’ class identity to infer the candidate's substantive goals, distributive commitments, and policy preferences on multiple issues. We test our hypotheses using an original survey with embedded experiments in Brazil, a highly unequal society with relatively weak partisanship, where the social and electoral value of class identities is most likely to be meaningful. We show that voters use candidates' class identities in addition to partisan and ideological platforms to make electoral choices and we examine which groups of voters are most likely to do so. Our study highlights the electoral value of class identities and its strategic value for candidates and parties. We expect class identities to be particularly relevant for ideologically centrist voters, ambivalent and cross-pressured voters, and for candidates in counter-stereotypical ideological positions (e.g., a working-class candidate running for a right-wing party). Our conclusions contribute to current debates about symbolic and substantive representation and the role of class vis-a-vis other identities.","Keywords: Representation, Class, Brazil, Voter Preferences, Survey Experiment","Alon Yakter","Alon Yakter","Tel Aviv University","Mafalda Pratas","European University Institute","Jorge Fernandes","Institute of Public Goods and Politics, CSIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tel Aviv University","European University Institute","Institute of Public Goods and Politics, CSIC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contrary to the widespread perception that these groups merely function as passive extensions of their mother parties, youth wings have increasingly demonstrated their capacity to develop distinct political agendas and organize independent events aimed at advancing their own priorities. This paper seeks to fill the gap in the literature by examining the protest behavior of youth wings across Europe. It investigates the key factors that drive these youth factions to mobilize and engage in street protests, often independently of their parent parties.By analyzing the complex relationship between mainstream political parties and their affiliated youth wings, I argue that when ideological differences between these two branches of the same political family become pronounced, youth factions are more likely to resort to protest actions to pursue their objectives. These protests not only signal dissatisfaction but also highlight the youth wings’ desire for political autonomy.To test these hypotheses, I compile new data on protest movements organised by youth wings, incorporating visual techniques to analyze ideological shifts based on party logos and symbols. The findings reveal that youth wings are more likely to organize protests when they feel underrepresented within their party’s governing structure or when there are clear ideological distinctions between themselves and the parent party. This research sheds light on the increasingly assertive role of youth wings in shaping party politics and contributing to protest culture in contemporary Europe.","Keywords: Party Politics; Youth Wing; Political Ideology","Winnie Xia","Winnie Xia",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A textual similarity analysis of African right to information laws","Autocratic learning is not reserved for autocracies alone. Recent writings on both autocratic diffusion and democratic regression show how lawmakers are inserting restrictive provisions, manipulating formulations, and subverting intended democratic laws. Emulation and learning are highlighted as key diffusion mechanisms where autocratic-minded actors are learning how to undermine democratic laws and institutions from previous examples. However, few studies of diffusion theorize on learning and emulation across regime types; Theories of democratic diffusion does not incorporate, and subsequently cannot explain, the increasing trend of subverting democratic forms for non-democratic purposes, while theories of authoritarian diffusion do not (yet) capture how autocratic ideas and practices can spread to democratic regimes.This paper examines autocratic diffusion as one possible explanation for subverting democratic laws across regime type. The study combines quantitative and qualitative text analysis methods to first measure textual similarities (i.e. copying) across laws and second trace instances of autocratic subversion to later laws (i.e. learning). It focuses on all Right to Information (RTI) laws in Africa. African RTI laws are known to be paradoxical, adopted by liberal democracies and autocracies alike. Some of these laws are limiting information rights instead of enhancing them, and the continent is countering a global trend of adopting increasingly stronger laws to guarantee the right to information. This paper shows that instances of autocratic learning happens in all regime types, autocracies and democracies alike. Additionally, this paper highlight how autocratic learning can happen within processes of democratic diffusion, like the spreading adoption of RTI laws globally.","Keywords: diffusion, democratic diffusion, authoritarian diffusion, autocratic learning, textual analysis","Lisa-Marie Selvik","Lisa-Marie Selvik",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"WZB Berlin Social Science Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article presents a preregistered meta-analysis of five coordinated field experiments aimed at evaluating whether collective efficacy, perceived injustice, and group identity can motivate women to engage more actively and effectively in non-electoral forms of political participation. We show that the intervention increased participation in a community grants program by an average of 13.7 points, with statistically significant and positive effects in four of five studies. We estimate that the treatment had demonstrable positive effects on the level of participation, the quality of participation, and responsiveness to women’s policy goals in two of our five sites. Our analysis of mechanisms shows that the effects on our main outcomes could have been mediated by collective efficacy as well as complementary processes that resulted from the training programs, such as self-efficacy, political knowledge, social networks, and shared policy priorities. We interpret this as evidence that this type of group empowerment intervention can increase political participation by marginalized groups beyond common informational treatments, and encourage further research to better understand when it is more likely to be effective.","Keywords: gender; political participation; field experiment; responsiveness; women; social psychology; collective efficacy","Lauren Young","Alexander Coppock","Yale University","Susan Hyde","UC Berkeley","Eddy Malesky","Duke University","Mathias Poertner","London School of Economics","Lauren Young","UC Davis","","","","","","","","","","","UC Davis","Duke University","London School of Economics","UC Berkeley","Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0231_2053_1061.html","Ethnic Conflict and the Degradation of Women: Evidence from the Manchu Conquest of China","This paper explores how foreign conquest and ethnonationalist pressures shape gender norms and women’s status. When an ethnic group faces defeat by an external force, it often responds by emphasizing its cultural distinctiveness as a form of resistance. In the case of the 17th-century Manchu conquest of China, the conquered Han populace, unable to resist militarily, reaffirmed traditional practices to distinguish themselves culturally from their Manchu rulers. This cultural response led to a reinforcement of gender norms and the intensification of women’s subordination.To investigate this process, we use a granular dataset detailing county-level Manchu military campaigns—including massacres, coerced submission, and other violent acts—and link these data to various indicators of women’s status. We examine over 43,000 records of chaste martyrs, analyze poetry referencing women, and employ computational methods on both historical and contemporary texts to gauge changes in gender norms. To measure long-term demographic consequences, we also utilize modern census data on sex ratio imbalances at birth and large-scale social media text analyses of gender attitudes.Through identification strategies such as difference-in-differences and geographic regression discontinuity designs, the study finds that exposure to Manchu conquest activities led to a substantial rise in chaste martyrdom records, signaling more stringent expectations of Confucian female virtue. These shifts in gender norms persisted through time, reflecting an enduring legacy in present-day demographics and attitudes. Ultimately, this research reveals how a conquered population’s cultural reaffirmation, intended to uphold ethnic identity, had profound and lasting detrimental effects on women’s status.","Keywords: Ethnicity, women, historical political economy, historical legacy, nationalism","Erik Wang","Erik Wang","New York University","Yinxuan Wang","New York University","Yuchen Xu","The University of New South Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York University","New York University","The University of New South Wales",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, the size of a protest is often interpreted to indicate the level of public support for its demands. This inference assumes that protests face participation costs that deter many supporters from taking part, leading observers to extrapolate broader support from the number of participants. However, this reasoning overlooks that protesters are a self-selected group of politically active citizens and makes the strong assumption that the costs of protesting are known. Using survey experiments with Swedish local politicians and citizens, we assess how citizens and politicians infer public opinion from protests. We vary a protest's size and participation costs in vignettes and introduce novel survey measures of public opinion perceptions. Preliminary evidence shows that flawed inferences are common, even when respondents are informed about selection biases or the varying costs of protests.","Keywords: Public opinion perception; protest; elite experiments; responsiveness","Elena Leuschner","Elena Leuschner","University of Gothenburg"," Jesper Lindqvist","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0233_1962_1270.html","Egocentric or Sociotropic? How Majority Groups Perceive Political Representation","This paper addresses a gap in representation research by examining how societal majority groups perceive their political representation. While existing studies have focused on the representation of marginalized groups and the positive effects of descriptive and substantive representation on their feeling of inclusion, the perceptions of majority groups have often been overlooked or assumed as a given. This study investigates whether majority group members - such as men, middle class members or white citizens - also feel represented through descriptive and substantive representation of their own group (egocentric representation) or whether they rather value diversity and the inclusion of marginalized groups and their interests in politics (sociotropic representation). The paper also analyzes which subgroups within the majority population are more likely to favor sociotropic representation, identifying key demographic and ideological predictors.To explore these questions, a conjoint experiment was conducted in which respondents evaluated hypothetical politicians based on their descriptive characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity) and substantive advocacy (e.g., support for gender equality). This experimental design allows for a systematic analysis of the relative importance of these attributes in shaping majority group members’ perceptions of representation. Additionally, observational survey data from Switzerland, the UK, and Germany provide complementary evidence on national-level dynamics. Results show that perceptions of representation vary significantly across majority group members, with some emphasizing egocentric alignment while others favor sociotropic benefits through the representation of underrepresented groups. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of political representation and its implications for fostering inclusive and legitimate democratic systems.","Keywords: Feeling represented, Majority groups, Sociotropic representation, Conjoint experiment","Daniel Höhmann","Daniel Höhmann","University of Basel","Stefanie Bailer","University of Basel","Jana Boukemia","University of Basel","Manuel Diaz Garcia","Goethe-University Frankfurt","Thomas Zittel","Goethe-University Frankfurt","","","","","","","","","","","University of Basel","Goethe-University Frankfurt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Com-pared to a passive control group, the three perspective-centered strategies—traditionalperspective-taking, analogical perspective-taking, and perspective getting—increasedthe likelihood that the sender would delete their xenophobic message, reduced theshare of new xenophobic messages sent over the following four weeks, and decreasedother users’ amplification of the xenophobic message. Although differences betweenthe three strategies were not statistically significant, the results suggest that analogi-cal perspective-taking—encouraging senders to compare their own experiences of beingattacked online with their discriminatory behavior toward outgroups—may have thestrongest effects. In contrast, disapproval messages had weaker effects. These findingsoffer theoretical and actionable insights for reducing intergroup hostility and its onlineamplification.","Keywords: Hate Speech, Social Media, Counterspeech, Field Experiment","Laurenz Derksen","Gloria Gennaro","University College London","Laurenz Derksen","ETH Zurich","Karsten Donnay","University of Zurich","Fabrizio Gilardi","University of Zurich","Dominik Hangartner","ETH Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","University College London","ETH Zurich","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While public commitment to democracy is crucial to counter recent trends of democratic backsliding, scholars stress that citizens’ support for democratic institutions is fragmented and fragile, particularly when it comes to protest rights. Drawing on evidence from the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, we study how citizens’ attitudes toward assemble rights change in response to violent and nonviolent protest events. First, we combine geocoded protest data and public opinion surveys, and run differencein-difference models to study how protests influence public support for assemble rights across 18 LAC countries in the period 2004-2018. Second, we conduct a survey experiment in Chile to test whether these effects vary at the individual level, depending on citizens’ pre-dispositions toward the protesters’ demands.

"abstract_0236_2551_0995.html","Gender-generation gaps and progressivism: the relationship between values and vote choice","How do gender and generational gaps in social and economic positions shape voting behaviour? With the shift from the traditional to the modern gender gap—where younger generations of women are increasingly likely to support left-leaning parties—the assumption has been that women are becoming progressively more liberal. However, emerging research highlights the complexity of the interplay between social and economic positions in shaping these gender-generation dynamics. This study explores whether the growing progressivism observed among young women leads to larger gender gaps in voting behaviour, or if economic grievances play a more significant role. Furthermore, it examines how intersectional identities interact with gender and generational shifts to influence voting patterns.Building on prior research, this study analyses how social and economic attitudes distinctly affect voting patterns across demographic groups over time. Using European Values Survey (EVS) data from OECD countries, we employ multilevel models to investigate variations in the electoral significance of economic versus social issues by gender, generation, education, and social class. Additionally, we assess how macro-level factors—such as welfare regime types, female labour force participation, and societal religiosity—moderate these relationships. By offering a comparative and intersectional perspective, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolving role of gender and generational gaps in shaping political behaviour in contemporary democracies.","Keywords: Gender gap, Voting behavior, Generational gaps, Social values, Political attitudes, Age-Period-Cohort","Liran Harsgor","Liran Harsgor","University of Haifa","Maria Grasso","Queen Mary University of London","Rosalind Shorrocks","University of Manchester","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Haifa","Queen Mary University of London","University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0237_1244_1527.html","Do Citizens really prefer women political candidates? Testing preferences for candidate gender using the reverse correlation technique.","Recent meta-analytical and multi-country studies employing vignettes, conjoint experiments, and explicit preference measures conclude that citizens, on average, prefer women political candidates (e.g., Schwarz & Coppock, 2022; Gothreau & Laustsen, 2024). And yet, women remain underrepresented in politics across the Globe. To better understand this obvious discrepancy, this project employs a well-validated experimental paradigm from the psychological sciences—the reverse correlation (RC) technique (Dotsch & Todorov, 2012; Schmitz et al. 2024)—to further scrutinize if citizens really prefer women candidates. The RC technique is a two-stage method that evokes participants’ visual representations of social categories, here political candidates. In Stage 1 (N=1,000), American participants are exposed to an array of visually distorted versions of the same androgynous face and asked to choose which face they prefer as politician. After repeating this choice many times, participants’ chosen faces are averaged to create a composite face that serves as a visual representation of their preferred politician. In stage 2, another sample of American participants (N=500), naive to Stage 1’s face-selection procedure, rate how well the composite faces resemble “a woman” or “a man” illuminating if participants from Stage 1 hold gendered mental representations of “political candidates”. Results provide an original and unobtrusive estimate of citizens’ preferences for candidate gender that is arguably less influenced by response and social desirability biases than existing work. Further, the RC technique allows for descriptively comparing whether explicitly stated preferences for women candidates are (mis)aligned with the way preferred politicians are represented “in the mind’s eye”.","Keywords: Political candidates, women, gender, reverse correlation technique, political representation.","Lasse Laustsen","Lasse Laustsen","Aarhus University"," Lei Fan","Aarhus University"," Wilson Merrell","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0238_1846_0102.html","Activating Local Memories of Armed Resistance against Nazi-Fascism Boosts Contemporary Anti-Fascist Sentiment","Can past wartime experiences exert a lasting influence on political behavior beyond those who lived through them?  We argue that memorialization—the public creation and preservation of historical memories—plays a crucial role in transmitting wartime legacies across generations. We demonstrate that these legacies are more enduring and politically consequential when memories are localized, meaning they are explicitly linked to historical local people, places, or events through a mechanism that we term localization. We test this argument through a mixed-methods study of the political legacies of armed partisan resistance during the Italian Civil War (1943–45). First, we employ a novel instrumental variable strategy to estimate the causal effects of organized armed resistance on contemporary measures of anti-fascist mobilization, including grassroots activism against neo-fascist propaganda and electoral support for anti-fascist parties. Leveraging spatial features of the Italian Civil War, we conduct multiple robustness checks to validate the exclusion restriction assumption that underlies our estimates. Second, we conduct a survey experiment targeting Italian municipalities that hosted partisan bands and similar municipalities that did not. This allows us to test whether localized memorialization has stronger attitudinal and behavioral effects on anti-fascism compared to generic, non-localized memorialization. Third, we provide novel qualitative evidence from a carefully selected case study, offering process-level insights into how localization shapes the transmission and mobilization of wartime memories over time. Our findings underscore the significance of localized memory in sustaining political legacies and mobilization, offering broader implications for understanding the enduring political effects of wartime experiences.","Keywords: Collective Memory; Antifascism; Grassroot Mobilization; Political Legacies; Resistance","Simone Cremaschi","Simone Cremaschi","Bocconi University","Juan Masullo","Leiden University; Università Statale di Milano","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi University","Leiden University","Università Statale di Milano",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0239_0366_0130.html","Choice Architecture for Messaging Corruption: Evidence from an Adaptive Experiment","The presentation and framing of information are the foundations of many behavioural experiments. In the case of corruption, policymakers such as NGOs face the challenge of informing citizens about the levels of malfeasance found in their local constituency. This challenge implies identifying an optimal messaging strategy that is sufficiently compelling to attract the interest of citizens. We addressed this challenge by evaluating six strategies for information messages often used in corruption information experiments. Using historical data from local government audit reports in Chile and in partnership with the NGO Chile Transparente, we implemented an online adaptive experiment using a modified Thompson Sampling algorithm (Exploration sampling) in which the assignment probabilities of the information treatments were updated in 11 batches of 100 subjects each. The results showed no unique optimal information strategy for malfeasance messages. However, a loss-frame information strategy tends to be slightly more persuasive than other ways of conveying information about corruption. We also found evidence that more rudimentary information metrics of corruption can be equally persuasive compared to more sophisticated ones. Finally, we do not found significant differences between using spatial comparison (i.e. comparing corruption in a local government across local constituencies within the same region) versus a temporal comparison (i.e. comparing the same local government across time).","Keywords: Corruption; Experiments","Felipe Torres Raposo","Felipe Torres Raposo","London School of Economics and Political Science","Raymond Duch","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","Nuffield College, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from India","How do electoral quotas focused on a single dimension of identity affect the representation of other disadvantaged identities? In this paper, I examine the impact of quotas for marginalized ethnic groups on women’s representation and argue that, when gender norms are correlated with social status, quotas for marginalized ethnic groups may influence women’s representation. To empirically test this, I use a novel design that leverages quasi-random variation in the assignment of caste quotas for council member seats in rural Maharashtra. I find that, for seats with quotas for marginalized caste groups, the likelihood of women running for and winning political office is higher than for seats without quotas. Consistent with the theory, I find evidence suggesting that these findings are driven by differential gender norms across groups. This paper highlights how norms matter for understanding the effects of electoral quotas on representation.","Keywords: Electoral quotas, local government, gram panchayat, caste, gender, India","Priyadarshi Amar","Priyadarshi Amar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Wisconsin-Madison",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These conflicting findings may be a consequence of focusing on a single shock type, a single preference measure, or a single regional or temporal context experiencing shocks. We address these limitations by creating and analyzing a new global dataset of collective shocks and social preferences at the subnational level. We then explore the potential differences in how various shocks (armed conflicts, natural disasters) relate to various social preferences (altruism, reciprocity, trust). Our preliminary analysis shows that, while exposure to wartime violence does not systematically alter prosociality, exposure to natural disasters reduces some social preferences in the short term, reverting to baseline levels in the long term. By comparing local experiences globally, our project helps develop a nuanced view of how shocks influence preferences, with implications for cooperation and governance.","Keywords: Violent Conflict, Natural Disasters, Altruism, Trust, Natural Experiment","Alexander Kustov","Alexander Kustov","UNC Charlotte"," James Walsh","UNC Charlotte"," Ivan Flores Martinez","UNC Charlotte","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UNC Charlotte",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0242_0317_0313.html","Machines of State: Electoral Manipulation under Occupation","How do occupying governments ensure their enduring control over territory? One common—though understudied—option has been the plebiscite, an institution that allows individuals residing in conquered territories to decide through a vote whether they want to continue living under the occupier or revert to the pre-occupation status quo. This use of the plebiscite has been common over the past 150 years, having been used (or promised) by German occupiers of Danish Northern Schleswig and Polish/Czech Upper Silesia; Chilean occupiers of Peruvian Tacna; and Russian occupiers in Crimea and Donbas. The use of a referendum presents a clear potential benefit for occupiers: it can provide a popular legitimation for annexation. This matters not only for domestic perceptions of the legitimacy of occupier rule but also for international audiences. Yet, plebiscites also carry a risk: if the occupier loses, it may be deprived of a claim to legitimate control over the occupied territory. Drawing on a novel quantitative analysis of individual-level plebiscite records from Chilean-occupied Tacna in the 1920s, we explore how governments minimize the risk of a failed plebiscite. We highlight the central role of the firm, developing and testing a theoretical framework that reveals a key prediction: occupiers often conduct electoral fraud through private companies.","Keywords: electoral fraud, foreign occupation, historical political economy, Latin American politics, democracy","Christopher Carter, Daniel Gingerich","Christopher Carter","University of Virginia"," Daniel Gingerich","University of Virginia","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Virginia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But how much do these effort correspond to a real ideological change on the part of these actors? We advance a theory of backstage and frontstage— two ideal types of contexts for political communication. In the former case, communication is private; in the latter case, it is public. We argue that in general, far-right politicians should make more counternormative claims in a backstage setting than in a frontstage one. Moreover, this gap should widen after events of ingroup violence and shrink after events of outgroup violence. We also formulate the hypothesis that the size of the frontstage-backstage gap depends on the actor’s characteristics (experience, rank within the party, gender) and, consequently, their incentives and capability to strategically conceal part of their ideology. We test these arguments using newly collected data on how politicians of the German far-right party AfD communicate in more private (Telegram) and more public (parliament) settings. Using state-of-the-art computational text analyses methods, we measure a number of characteristics of their communication in both settings, including overall negativity, use of sensitive language, and proximity to Nazi rhetoric. Our findings highlight the incentives that stigmatized political actors have to communicate with different levels of radicalism, and the types of factors that can alter said incentives.","Keywords: radical right, political discourse, text-as-data, social media","Tobias Widmann","Giovanni Capoccia","University of Oxford","Vicente Valentim","IE University","Tobias Widmann","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","IE University","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing theories propose competing predictions: some argue that heightened national identity reduces support for redistribution by prioritizing national interests over class-based ones, while others suggest that national identity fosters social solidarity and trust in reciprocity, enhancing support for redistributive policies. We use survey data from the European Social Survey (2002–2023) and the quasi-exogenous timing of international football matches as shocks to national identification to bring causal evidence to this debate. Using instrumental variable (IV) and regression discontinuity (RDD) designs, we show that heightened national identification increases support for redistribution. This effect holds across income groups but is particularly pronounced among high-income individuals, suggesting that national identification fosters a sense of shared obligation that transcends class boundaries.

Anticipating future reduced support from her successor, the incumbent leader of the patron state is incentivized to increase support to encourage the protégé to escalate. A successful escalation improves the issue’s division for both the patron and the protégé, while a failure worsens the status quo, pressuring the successor to provide support they might otherwise withhold. We illustrate this theory with the Biden administration’s landmark decision to allow Ukraine to attack Russian territory with U.S. weapons following Donald Trump’s election as president.

Reversing the previously explored causal relationship, this paper studies how anti-democratic measures contribute to polarisation, suggesting a cyclical dynamic between the two. Employing unexpected events during survey approach, this study capitalizes on the unexpected suspension of the 2016 recall referendum against Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela during the 2016 AmericasBarometer survey fieldwork to create a natural experiment. This innovative approach allows us to robustly estimate the causal effects of democratic backsliding on affective polarisation. The initial findings reveal an asymmetrical impact on polarisation: while electoral manipulation did not broadly heighten perceptions of societal polarization, it significantly intensified out-group animosity among opposition voters. This extension of blame to the actions of the incumbent suggests individuals hold equally accountable the supporters of the incumbent party for the erosion of democracy.Furthermore, incumbent supporters displayed no significant change in their attitudes following the suppression of the opposition. Their apparent indifference toward opposition grievances suggests that reactions to democratic backsliding are heavily influenced by group identification, highlighting a concerning prioritization of political gains over democratic principles.

However, the causal link between nostalgic political appeals and voter responses remains untested. In this paper, we propose a new theory of how nostalgic rhetoric influences public opinion and voting behavior. We propose that nostalgic rhetoric serves as a shortcut, or symbolic tool, implicitly signaling a candidate’s commitment to particular issues and social groups, thereby shaping voting behavior. In two survey experiments across three European countries, we manipulate the use of nostalgic rhetoric in political statements, and measure its effects on voters’ perceptions of candidates’ social group representation and their policy commitment on the cultural and economic dimensions. We also estimate the causal effect of nostalgia on their voting behavior. Our findings demonstrate how nostalgic rhetoric influences voters’ perceptions by signaling a commitment to specific groups and policies, which, in turn, impacts voting behavior. Rather than merely appealing to voters who wish to “turn back the clock”, this study suggests that nostalgia is an effective means to garner support from groups with specific commitments and preferences, contributing to a conservative bias in electoral politics.","Keywords: political nostalgia, far-right, political representation, comparative political behavior","Francesco Colombo","Francesco Colombo","Collegio Carlo Alberto","Fred Paxton","University of Glasgow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collegio Carlo Alberto","University of Glasgow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

National parliamentary discourse and its effect on public opinion on the European Union","The European Union (EU) is nowadays a hot issue in national politics. As a result of years of intense crises, such as the Eurocrisis, the refugee crisis or the war in Ukraine, the EU has become an object of contestation in national parliaments. Existing studies have unveiled that mainstream political parties adopt pro-EU views, whereas extremist political parties defend anti-EU stances. How national parliamentary discourse on the EU affects public opinion, however, remains unknown. Often, individuals have very little knowledge about the EU. Evidence demonstrates that EU politics are perceived as more complex and technical than national politics. Parliaments, the biggest arenas for deliberation and communication, can contribute to disseminating information and arguments that foster individuals to formulate their political preferences. Thus, the national parliamentary discourse can, arguably, influence public opinion on the EU. We analyse how the national parliamentary discourse shapes EU public opinion by looking at parliamentary speech data and individual-level data from eight EU countries between 2000 and 2021. The findings suggest that the tone of radical right parties on EU topics influences how citizens perceive the EU. This effect is moderated by the salience of EU speeches by radical right parties and individuals' ideological self-placement. The results also suggest that the tone of radical left parties on EU topics does not influence EU public opinion formation.","Keywords: European Union, Public Opinion, Radical Parties, Text-as-Data, Parliamentary Discourse","Mariana Carmo Duarte","Mariana Carmo Duarte","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","Rebecca Kittel","Free University of Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","Free University of Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that candidates who fail to secure a seat over their political allies, be them coalition members or copartisans, are more likely to leave their party either by switching affiliation or abandoning candidacy in their municipalities. I also determine that party switching is rooted in opportunistic behavior, where losing candidates leave their party when their personal vote shares are higher. This effect persists even for stronger and more disciplined parties, namely the Workers' Party. Finally, given the strategic fluidity of party affiliation and the electoral opportunism behind party switching, I provide evidence that this nullifies the personal incumbency advantage for city councilors.","Keywords: Elections, Electoral institutions, Intragroup competition, Party switching, Political parties","Andrew Saab","Andrew Saab",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Northwestern University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Social democrats traditionally appealed to the working class, liberals and conservatives to managerial and professional classes, and Christian democrats to religious communities. Over time, secularization and dealignment have disrupted these connections, contributing to the decline of mainstream parties. This raises questions about whether and how these parties have adapted their appeals to address evolving societal dynamics.This paper investigates social group appeals in mainstream party manifestos across eight Western European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Portugal) from 1960 to 2023. It examines the frequency, diversity, and concentration of social group mentions and distinguishes between positive and negative appeals. Positive appeals align with representational logic, explicitly targeting groups, while negative appeals use a reference-based approach, mobilizing support through criticism of certain groups.The research employs a novel methodological framework combining supervised token classification, semi-supervised clustering, and sentiment analysis to systematically identify and evaluate social group mentions. By applying this approach to a large dataset, the study offers new insights into party strategies and their adaptation to changing societal contexts.By tracking changes over time, across parties, and countries, the findings reveal shifts in mainstream party communication and their alignment with social groups. This contributes to broader debates on electoral dynamics and the evolving role of social groups in political representation.","Keywords: Mainstream parties, social group appeals, representation, large language model","Jasmien Luypaert","Jasmien Luypaert",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Ghent University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, several recent studies have failed to find a causal link with a weakening of democratic norms and attitudes. We contend that affective polarization is not a direct cause of undemocratic sentiments, but a symptom of other factors which also influence democratic support. Moreover, such drivers of affective polarization may have counteracting effects on democratic support, causing previous work on the consequences of affective polarization to yield mixed results.In this study, we focus on two important confounders of this relationship. Firstly, we argue that affective polarization often is a manifestation of political involvement, which simultaneously bolsters democratic support. When affective polarization merely reflects strong involvement, a polarized citizenry should not be a concern; quite the contrary. Secondly, affective polarization may be the result of anti-elitism, an attitude that is likely to cause lower democratic support. Previous research that found affective polarization harmful to democracy might have largely been driven by citizens who, in fact, hold anti-elitist attitudes. To test our theory, we triangulate three novel cross-sectional studies conducted in 18 Western democracies (N = 32,000) with a series of cross-national vignette experiments (N = 8,000). By disentangling how political involvement and anti-elitism relate to affective polarization and democratic support, we aim to shed light on existing mixed findings and provide a more nuanced account of the normative (un)desirability of affective polarization.","Keywords: affective polarization; political involvement; anti-elitism; democratic support; comparative research","Jochem Vanagt","Jochem Vanagt","KU Leuven; University of Antwerp","Emma Turkenburg","Wageningen University & Research","Markus Wagner","University of Vienna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KU Leuven","University of Antwerp","Wageningen University & Research","University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While Type I audience costs, linked to unfulfilled threats, have been previously explored in China, this research uniquely addresses the dynamics of Type II costs within an authoritarian context. We employ a survey experiment involving eight conditions, presenting Chinese respondents with scenarios of territorial disputes that vary in the government’s initial commitments, subsequent actions, and justificatory rhetoric. We hypothesize that inconsistencies, whether from failed threats or unexpected escalation, will provoke public disapproval, with special attention to the underexplored Type II costs. Additionally, we investigate whether specific rhetorical strategies can mitigate these audience costs. For Type I scenarios, we test justifications centered on “prioritizing broader interests” and “avoiding strategic traps.” In Type II scenarios, we assess the effectiveness of rhetoric emphasizing “foreign entanglement” and “betrayal of trust,” derived from prevalent Chinese diplomatic discourse. Our findings contribute to the literature by extending the concept of audience costs to non-democratic settings and illuminating how autocratic leaders may leverage rhetoric to manage public opinion in foreign policy. This research provides a nuanced perspective on the interaction between public sentiment and decision-making in Chinese foreign policy.","Keywords: Audience cost, international relations, China, Territorial Disputes","Enze Han, Ronan Tse-min Fu","Enze Han","The University of Hong Kong"," Ronan Tse-min Fu","The University of Hong Kong","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The University of Hong Kong",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To prevent climate change, push measures like carbon taxes need to be part of the policy mix. Nevertheless, public support for push measures seems to be lacking, a phenomenon that cannot completely be explained by climate scepticism or individual and contextual influences beyond direct policy control, such as trust in government and local vulnerabilities. However, the role of specific policy design choices on public support has only recently been picked up by empirical studies, let alone the heterogeneous effects these policy design choices can have on different social groups. By use of a large-scale survey experiment among voters in the Netherland, this study examines the impact of policy design features on public support for push measures aimed at mitigating climate change. We show there is substantial variation in support for push measures depending on the specific issue a policy focusses on, and the impact it has on individual costs. Furthermore, we find that policy designs can have substantial effects on public support, especially structuring taxation in a consumption based progressive way (PolluterPayPrinciple) and earmarking revenue towards attractive pull measures, but that these effects differ between different policies. In addition, we find heterogeneous effects based on ideology. Overall, we demonstrate that policy design matters for public acceptance of carbon taxes, and that design choices should be policy specific to convince specific groups of citizens.","Keywords: Policy support, Just transition, Survey experiment, Climate politics","Jaap van Slageren","Remko Voogd","Radboud University","Jaap van Slageren","Utrecht University","Damion Bunders","Utrecht University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Utrecht University","Radboud University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0255_0114_0944.html","Marginal Component Effects as Measures of Preferences in Conjoint Experiments: Assessing Predictive Validity at the Individual Level","Marginal component effects (MCEs) are the most popular causal estimands in conjoint experiments, but they have been recently criticized on both conceptual and methodological grounds. This debate exclusively considers average MCEs (i.e. AMCEs), but many of the questions raised can only be addressed with individual-level data. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by estimating individual MCEs and exploring their predictive validity. Our evidence comes from two studies, one in Germany and one in the United States, in which respondents both rate hypothetical candidates in conjoint experiments and report their support for real-world parties.

"abstract_0256_0382_1001.html","FEMNAT: Who speaks matters? The role of descriptive representation in femonationalist communication","Does descriptive representation of women and ethnic minorities legitimize anti-immigrant claims in the name of women’s rights? Recent evidence suggests that femonationalist communication is not only on the rise in Western democracies, but also that the invocation of gender equality for nativist claims leads citizens to selectively adapt their preferences. At the same time, there is growing evidence that parties who employ femonationalism have so-called ‘token’ politicians amongst their ranks that descriptively represent women and ethnic minority groups. What remains underexplored is to what extend such social categories play into the effect of femonationalist speech. Does learning about politicians’ social categories affect citizens’ proclivity to adapt their preferences? This paper explores this question by conducting an original visual vignette experiment with 3 000 U.K. citizens, varying both the gender (male, female) and the ethnicity (British-white/ Middle eastern) of communicating politician. The message, claiming that immigration imposes a threat to gender equality and women’s safety in the U.K., is constant across all treatments. It is expected that femonationalist speech by women politicians and by Muslim (Middle eastern) politicians, yield stronger effects on support for a) progressive gender policies and b) assimilationist integration policies than by a male, white politician. These effects are conditional on citizens’ general immigration attitudes.","Keywords: femonationalism, visual experiment, representation, integration attitudes, immigration attitudes","Sophie Mainz","Sophie Mainz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Uppsala University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0257_1130_1065.html","The Impact of Gender Quotas on Education Provision in Indian Local Government","How does a politician’s identity impact public good provision? Existing literature in developing countries emphasises the potential of female politicians to change existing gender norms and serve as role models to encourage education of girls. Women politicians may focus on education policies, but their choices might be shaped or constrained by existing gender norms and opportunities. I focus on India, a context where women have been excluded from politics and education, although political gender quotas offer a potential pathway to mitigate these inequalities. I examine the causal impact of randomized gender quotas for local government leadership on education provision and access. I study rural and urban municipalities in Rajasthan and Delhi, leveraging electoral, administrative, survey, and geolocated school-level data to create novel education measures between 2005 and 2018. I find that while political gender quotas do not affect school infrastructure, they have a positive effect on enrolment overall. Specifically, government school enrolment increases for boys and girls in urban municipalities whereas rural areas see an increase in private school enrolment. I explore potential reasons for this urban-rural difference including length of exposure to gender quotas, electoral incentives and state capacity. Additionally, I find limited evidence of a differential impact of quotas for women from disadvantaged castes on children from those castes. Planned fieldwork next April will help further assess the mechanisms behind why female politicians engage with education in this context. This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of gender quotas and education provision across levels of government.","Keywords: gender, quotas, identity, education provision, state capacity","Tarsha Vasu","Tarsha Vasu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0258_1414_1101.html","Does School Ownership Matter? Assessing Outcomes at the Individual and Market Levels","How should the provision of education be organized, and does the type of school ownership—public, private for-profit, or private not-for-profit—matter? This paper addresses this question using 30 years of comprehensive register data from Sweden, matched with ownership information on private schools operating within the country’s publicly funded universal voucher system, to make two key contributions. First, it evaluates the individual effects of attending schools with different ownership types using a sibling comparison design. Second, it examines the market-level consequences of increased private provision by exploiting variation in private school growth across municipalities. The findings show that attending private schools—both for-profit and not-for-profit—leads to improvements in grades and test scores during compulsory education, with particularly strong effects for for-profit schools. However, these benefits do not extend to longer-term outcomes, such as SAT scores, university attendance, or labor market incomes. At the market level, competition from private schools raises overall grades in both public and private schools but also increases segregation, particularly between students with immigrant and non-immigrant backgrounds, while leaving education costs largely unchanged. These results are particularly relevant as countries worldwide increasingly consider school choice and privatization policies. Sweden offers a unique context for this analysis, as its system enables comparisons of ownership types while holding funding conditions constant. For policymakers, this highlights the trade-offs involved in balancing efficiency, equity, and educational outcomes when introducing competition within educational systems.","Keywords: Education Policy, Privatization, Register Data","Simon Gren","Simon Gren",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Role of Empowered Knowledge Workers","Large companies in the United States are increasingly vocal about progressive causes, such as gender and racial equality and climate change, but they are often politically cross-pressured. This article proposes a novel theory to explain when and why firms engage in corporate political speech on these issues, focusing on an economically influential segment of the workforce: knowledge economy winners. I argue that firms with homogeneously progressive workforces are more likely to take public stances on progressive causes, particularly during periods of labor market tightness. I test this hypothesis using a difference-in-differences design and linking Twitter data from S&P 500 companies with employee donation records from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and firm-level data on employees and consumers from SafeGraph and People Data Labs. This pattern, however, is moderated by consumer ideology and their geographical distribution.

We study a microcorporatist approach to improve access to local services and resources for marginalized smallholder farmers. We leverage a randomized controlled trial in which a civil society organization ran a campaign with smallholder cooperatives and municipal authorities in municipalities in rural northern Paraguay. The study took place just after a 2016 law mandating participatory municipal planning. The campaign worked with cooperatives to improve the articulation of their corporate interests and with municipal authorities to host spaces for inclusive development deliberation. We find that smallholders, and particularly the leaders of the smallholders' collectives, substantially improve their standing vis-a-vis municipal authorities. Mayors' priorities for service provision are brought into alignment with smallholder priorities, as evidenced by the municipal development plans submitted to national authorities. Given the relatively short duration of the follow-up period, we do not find a measurable impact on smallholder income or agricultural output. Nonetheless, our findings show that the intervention can disrupt clientelistic dynamics, making rural development planning more inclusive and representative of the interests of the poor.","Keywords: Development, participatory planning, clientelism, randomized experiment","Cyrus Samii","Cyrus Samii","New York University","Antonella Bandiera","ITAM","Gustavo Setrini","FLACSO Paraguay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York University","ITAM","FLACSO Paraguay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contrary to conventional wisdom that extractive industries typically hinder development, we argue that mining can stimulate local-level development through bargaining between state, firms, and local communities. We collect information on all mining investments in India between 1995-2020 to test this theory. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that mining investments can increase large-scale infrastructure investment but have limited effects on local public goods or individual-level welfare. We attribute this discrepancy to the uneven distribution of benefits, with promised investments often failing to benefit mining-affected communities. We provide evidence of our bargaining mechanism by demonstrating that mining investments spur conflict between state and society and that communities with better bargaining power achieve more positive development outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding state-society interactions to development outcomes in extractive contexts.","Keywords: India, state capacity, state-society, mining, development, infrastructure","Aliz Toth","Aliz Toth","London School of Economics and Political Science","Emily Russell","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As extreme weather events intensify, they create social and economic challenges that likely impact political candidacy. We build on existing research on mass political participation and the political economy of candidate entry and test how extreme weather events affect decisions to pursue a political career. Using a novel dataset of flooding events and mayoral candidates in Brazil (2000-2020), we employ a difference-in-differences design to assess the impact of floods on the demographic composition of the mayoral candidate pool. We find that floods reduce the education level and age of candidates. Using data on federal transfers, corruption audits, surveys, and eliteinterviews, we show the effects on education can be driven by rent-seeking and outside options, whilst mobilization and recruitment patterns drive the age effects. By shedding light on the effects of climate change on candidate selection, this study highlights how climate change can paradoxically increase the representation of underrepresented groups in politics.","Keywords: climate change, political entry, Brazil, political elites, difference-in-differences","António Valentim","Guilherme Fasolin","Vanderbilt University","António Valentim","London School of Economics and Political Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","Vanderbilt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We leverage a unique opportunity to answer this question. In 2022, we conducted a two-wave panel survey in Peru, measuring explicit support for democracy through survey questions and implicit support through votes for undemocratic hypothetical candidates in a conjoint experiment. Later that year, former president Pedro Castillo unexpectedly (and unsuccessfully) attempted to shut down Congress, and we conducted a third wave among the same panelists. Our analysis of responses to Castillo's move reveals that Peruvians do not unanimously condemn Castillo’s self-coup, and, unsurprisingly, Castillo voters were more indulgent of it. Castillo voters further adjusted their democratic standards to accommodate Castillo’s move. Using differences-in-differences, we also show that Castillo voters defected from democracy after the self-coup. Then, using machine learning techniques and regressions, we find that explicit survey responses about democratic values are the strongest predictors of condemning Castillo's undemocratic attempt, similarly predictive than having voted for Castillo. The implicit measure from our conjoint also predicts such condemnation, but very weakly. Harnessing this rare setup, we contribute to explaining and anticipating citizens’ commitment to democracy when the time comes.","Keywords: democracy, Peru, surveys, experiments, backsliding","Hernán Carvajal, Natalia Garbiras-Díaz","Hernán Carvajal","World Bank","Loreto Cox","Universidad Católica de Chile","Natalia Garbiras-Díaz","Harvard Business School","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","World Bank","Universidad Católica de Chile","Harvard Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Focusing on the speech actors, this article suggests that party leaders, not parties, are the primary drivers of populist rhetoric in legislative speech. Building on the party leader and party competition literature, it develops two specific expectations: fluctuations in populism are 1) leader-driven and 2) influenced by the emphasis on immigration in speech. Using parliamentary speech data from the Netherlands (2002-2019) and Austria (1999-2019), this study employs a large language model to measure populist speech and BERTopic models to assess immigration content. The results support that party leaders' debate contributions show higher levels of populism. Additionally, both party leaders and MPs dial back their populist rhetoric while in a coalition but intensify it when discussing their 'owned issue', immigration. The latter tendency is especially pronounced for party leaders.","Keywords: Party Leadership, Populism, Legislative Speeches","Clint Claessen","Clint Claessen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While existing scholarship has identified a number of factors that shape welfare state attitudes, individual evaluations of institutional quality have received relatively little attention. I seek to address this gap by studying the way in which exposure to information about institutional inefficiency affects views on the role of the state in alleviating socio-economic inequality. To do this, I rely on two empirical strategies. I begin by leveraging a natural experiment in Denmark where a public servant was arrested for corruption and embezzlement of especially large proportions. I proceed to run an original priming experiment in the United Kingdom. Drawing on an audit report by the Department of Work and Pensions, I inform participants of the amount of fund misallocation within the Universal Credit system and ask them about their support for different welfare, social investment, and market intervention policies. This multi-stage empirical approach allows me to explore whether perceptions about corruption and institutional quality are correlated with welfare state attitudes and how respondents' support for state-sponsored redistribution changes in response to their being primed to think about the quality of the institutional apparatus and the cleanliness of the bureaucratic service in their country.","Keywords: support for redistribution, welfare states, quality of government, political economy","Bilyana Petrova","Bilyana Petrova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Texas Tech University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since regulation affects profit, business activities are politically informative and enable firms to strategically manipulate voters' political preferences. In response, incumbents regulate to induce business activities that maximize their reelection prospects. When firms and voters are aligned in regulatory preferences, incumbents always concede to create favorable regulatory environments for firms, leading to over-investment in equilibrium. When firms and voters are misaligned, incumbents concede to firms when voters' pocketbook concerns weigh heavily but crowd out investments when voters prioritize regulation. Voters and firms benefit when they are aligned. Voters may benefit even when they are misaligned with firms, though such firms may incur opportunity costs of under-investment. Economic and political distortions caused by pocketbook voting need not be bad for voters nor good for firms, but incumbents always become more likely to be reelected.","Keywords: Political accountability, money in politics","Joohyun Shon","Joohyun Shon",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, this evidence focuses on a few negative emotions and studies them toward the out-party only, missing positive emotions and neglecting that polarization is integral to affective polarization. Using cross-sectional data from five European countries (N = 4,794), this paper shows that affectively polarized individuals primarily experience a polarization of positive emotions for the in-party relative to the out-party, and some polarization in disgust, aversion, hate, and indifference for the out-party relative to the in-party. This nuance improves criterion validity, such that primarily enthusiasm, pride, and hope for the in-party (relative to the out-party) are associated with turnout.

This paper examines how parental divorce influences voter turnout in adulthood. Using comprehensive Swedish registry data on voter turnout and family backgrounds, we perform a sibling analysis to assess how the age at parental separation affects long-term political engagement. We identify a pronounced age gradient: younger children experience stronger negative impacts on adult voter turnout, with effects visible in early childhood and during their formative years. The effects are especially pronounced among boys and persist even when controlling for factors such as family income, education, and employment.

In contrast, Chinese FDI, driven by profit motives, offers limited fungibility and weaker effects on authoritarian durability. Using country-year and leader-year panel data and hazard models, I find that higher levels of Chinese loans significantly reduce the risk of irregular leader exits and regime failures, while Chinese FDI shows a more nuanced relationship.

This study explores the connection between nostalgia and democratic decline, focusing on the East German state of Thuringia as a case study. Thuringia garnered international attention after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 32.8% of the vote in the September 2024 election, becoming the largest party. We argue and empirically demonstrate that nostalgia for an illiberal past fosters anti-liberal political attitudes in the present. Political actors can exploit such nostalgia to legitimize and glorify authoritarian or illiberal regimes, mobilizing opposition to the democratic status quo and justifying autocratic governance practices. To investigate these dynamics, we analyze longitudinal, representative survey data from the “Thüringen-Monitor” covering the past 20 years. This allows for a detailed examination of nostalgia for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), its key drivers—such as status loss—and its relationship with democratic attitudes and voting behavior. In addition, qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses provides deeper insights into the nature of GDR nostalgia and citizens’ perceptions of democracy. Our findings reveal that the AfD capitalized on widespread GDR nostalgia, amplified by skepticism toward democracy and persistent misconceptions about its functioning. These results underscore how nostalgia for an illiberal past can serve as a fertile ground for extremist parties, posing a significant challenge to democratic stability.","Keywords: Nostalgia; democracy; AfD; Germany; GDR","Anja Neundorf","Anja Neundorf","University of Glasgow","Natasha Lindstead","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","University of Essex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We operatise these dimensions with original public opinion data taken from a survey fielded in early 2025 (https://solid-erc.eu/) in 15 EU member states. By intersecting EU citizens’ degrees of satisfaction with the status quo with their likelihood to vote for their country leaving the EU in a hypothetical referendum on EU membership, we identify three main categories of citizens: convinced remainers, who are satisfied and would vote “remain”, convinced exiters, who are unsatisfied and would vote “leave”; and reluctant remainers, who are unsatisfied but still would vote “remain”. We plot their preferences on strengthening the EU polity along different binding, bounding and bonding dimensions, then perform individual-level analysis, locating characteristics associated with these types of citizens, with a particular focus on their view of the perceived political, social and economic impact of EU membership for their country and the EU’s effectiveness in managing past crises.

"abstract_0274_1752_0801.html","Legislative Party Switching and Party Electoral Support","In most democratic legislatures it is common for elected members of parliament to switch to existing or new parties or become independents. In this study we address the under-researched question of whether and when party switching by legislators affects party support in elections under the proportional electoral systems. We focus on the support of parties that lost MPs (origin parties) and those that received in-switchers (recipient parties). We focus on two sets of mechanisms through which party switching may affect voters’ party choice. First, the origin party may lose votes because switching potentially sends a strong signal to the electorate that the party is divided. Second, research on personalised politics implies that at least some voters follow switchers from origin parties to recipient parties. We expect that these effects are stronger when MP switches into an existing party (defection) or establishes a new party (split) than when MP becomes an independent in parliament (exit). We further expect that electoral gains and losses are concentrated in the electoral districts of the switcher MPs and the effect of switching on electoral outcomes is stronger when switchers are electorally prominent. Our empirical analysis uses data from two cases with closed-list PR systems (Italy and Romania) and one case with open-list PR (Poland) and combines district-level electoral data and individual voter data. Our study reveals how voters respond to switching and the potential of party instability in parliaments to lead to a broader party system change.","Keywords: Party switching, party split, party electoral support, personalised politics, party valence","Raimondas Ibenskas","Raimondas Ibenskas","University of Bergen","Sona Golder","Pennsylvania State University","Paulina Salek-Lipcean","University of Bergen","Allan Sikk","University College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bergen","Pennsylvania State University","University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Respondents, representing interest groups, are presented with hypothetical scenarios that vary in public and political support and asked to indicate their lobbying priorities. A follow-up explores the motivations behind these choices, examining factors such as cost, audience reach, and perceived effectiveness.By integrating insights into the strategic considerations of interest groups, we advance our understanding of how these organizations navigate increasingly complex advocacy environments.

"abstract_0278_0237_1349.html","More than Symbols : The Effect of Symbolic Policies on Climate Policy Support","As the effects of climate change become increasingly salient, the need for stringent climate policies has become more pressing. However, their implementation is often met with resistance from the public. To address this challenge, scholars have mostly focused on the material compensations that can be leveraged to increase public support among policy losers. In this paper, we go beyond existing literature by testing the effects of ""symbolic climate policies"". We conceptualize symbolic policies as policies which primarily serve a purpose of ""sending a message"" and signaling shared concerns and values to the public. They, per se, have very little impact on climate change mitigation nor direct consequences for most citizens. In this sense, they have low material impacts but high symbolic effects due to their appeals to shared values and emotions. For example, policies symbolically targeting the carbon-intensive behavior of privileged social groups like politicians or billionaires would qualify as such.We argue that adopting symbolic policies increases support for costly climate policies, like reduction of speed limits or carbon taxes, when bundled together. In this example, they do so by symbolically appealing to feelings of unfairness, reciprocity, exemplarity and resentment towards elites. We demonstrate our argument using several survey experiments among a representative sample of the French population, complemented by qualitative interviews with citizens to refine the mechanisms. Our results hold significant policy relevance as they demonstrate that symbolic policies, while not directly contributing to climate change mitigation, are instrumental in garnering support for more effective mitigation measures.","Keywords: climate policy ; mixed-methods ; policy support ; public opinion ; symbolic","Theodore Tallent","Theodore Tallent","Centre for European Studies and Comparative politics, Sciences Po, Paris, France; Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.","Malo Jan","Centre for European Studies and Comparative politics, Sciences Po, Paris, France","Luis Sattelmayer","Centre for European Studies and Comparative politics, Sciences Po, Paris, France","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Centre for European Studies and Comparative politics, Sciences Po, Paris, France","Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0279_1478_0942.html","Capturing Complex Preferences: Constant Sum Scales as an Advanced Method to Study Preferences for Mixed Governance Systems","Recent research challenges traditional singular models of government (e.g., representative vs. direct democracy) and advocates for mixed models integrating representative, participatory, expertocratic, and executive elements (e.g., Pilet et al. (2023), Schwaiger & Bächtiger (2024)).This study advances the measurement of preferences for mixed governance systems by using a constant sum question to directly capture trade-offs and nuanced preferences across multiple governance models. Analysing two representative samples of 5,000 respondents from Germany and the US, the results reveal a strong preference for mixed models, with 93% of respondents dividing decision-making power among at least two models, and most incorporating all four (representative, participatory, expertocratic, and assertive leader model).Further analyses confirm the validity of the constant sum approach, and show its alignment with other preference measures, such as Likert-scale items, a single-choice question, and results from conjoint analyses. Participants' justifications for their model combinations indicate considered decision preferences rather than simplistic gut reactions or non-attitudinal responses. The constant sum method also differs from the Likert scale items in terms of its predictive power and response bias, such as acquiescence. In addition to directly capturing preferences for specific governance model combinations, the nuanced structure and determinants of these mixed preferences become even more apparent when combined with fuzzy clustering and regression analysis. This paper demonstrates the value of constant sum questions in advancing the measurement of preferences for mixed governance systems and their underlying trade-offs.","Keywords: mixed governance systems, compositional data","Anja Rieker","Anja Rieker","University of Stuttgart"," André Bächtiger","University of Stuttgart","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Stuttgart",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0280_0388_1003.html","FEMNAT - Political representation in femonationalist times","Research shows that voters are generally reluctant to support Muslim politicians, especially voters with a strong tendency to vote for populist radical right parties. One strategy used by minority politicians to overcome this scrutiny is ""broadstancing,"" which involves distancing themselves from their minority group. While this can improve their appeal to the general population, it may also provoke backlash from within the minority group, making it a costly strategy.This study investigates whether similar dynamics apply to Muslim politicians who adopt feminist policy positions. Drawing on research on political representation, respectability politics, and femonationalism, the study explores how historical femonationalist narratives impact Muslim politicians’ ability to gain broad acceptance. It also examines whether voters respond differently to Muslim politicians who advocate for gender equality.To explore this, I conducted survey experiments with 3,052 respondents from France, Germany, and the Netherlands, including an oversample of respondents with migration backgrounds. Each survey presented six fictional profiles of politicians with varying religious affiliations and positions on gender equality.While there was strong bias against Muslim politicians among voters without a migration background, this bias disappeared when the politicians supported gender equality. Muslim voters, even those personally opposed to gender equality, were more favorable toward Muslim politicians endorsing it. This suggests that advocating for gender equality is an effective, low-cost strategy for Muslim politicians, which may explain why many have already adopted this approach.","Keywords: Muslim politicians, femonationalism, discrimination, political representation, populist radical right, respectability politics","Sanne van Oosten","Sanne van Oosten",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building upon the ``critical mass'' framework, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the effect of quotas on women's descriptive and substantive representation in the EP. We find that quotas, while (mechanically) raising the number of women running for the EP, left the share of elected women unaffected. The policy, in fact, did not boost voters' likelihood to vote for women, while making party selectorates more likely to relegate female candidates to the bottom of the electoral lists. Although quotas did not increase women's descriptive representation in the EP, they appear to have made male MEPs more `disciplined' in Roll Call Votes. This effect is not driven by a change in the average educational attainments nor in the distribution of leadership roles within the EP. Rather, we show that quotas, reducing the slots available to men in party lists, worsened their re-electability perspectives.","Keywords: European Parliament; Gender Quotas; Critical Mass Theory; Representation","Riccardo Di Leo","Anatole Cheysson","University of Bologna","Riccardo Di Leo","European University Institute","Biljana Meiske","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","University of Bologna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates the extent to which these issues are reflected in, or drive, the research conducted by AI scientists and developers. Utilizing a dataset of top-tier conference papers across multiple AI subfields and Arxiv submissions from 2014 onward, we analyze the integration of societal influence—defined as the incorporation of ethical values and societal concerns into research motivations, design, and outcomes. We further explore who is addressing these challenges, with a specific focus on the role of interdisciplinary teams and corporate-affiliated researchers. Lastly, we evaluate the academic impact of value-driven research by assessing its visibility through citation networks and recognition within the AI community. As public discourse on AI's societal implications intensifies, this study provides a systematic evaluation of whether and how these concerns are embedded in the research agendas of those advancing AI technologies. By identifying patterns of adoption, collaboration, and academic influence, our findings shed light on the evolving relationship between societal priorities and technological development, offering critical insights for policymakers and public policy discussions on how AI research can meaningfully address societal challenges.","Keywords: AI research, Machine learning, Science of science, AI policy","Fabrizio Gilardi, Dror Markus","Fabrizio Gilardi","University of Zürich"," Daria Stetsenko","University of Zürich"," Dror Markus","University of Zürich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0283_2301_0103.html","The Geography of Discontent: Historical Turnout Decline and the Rise of Populism in Europe","We explore the origins of the rise of populism in Europe by investigating how historical turnout decline shapes the contemporaneous rise of populist voting. We extend the recent political economy literature that has emphasized the role of economic shocks by adding the role of historical turnout decline as a key political moderator. As such, the main research question is to what extent the contemporaneous rise of populism is jointly explained by the economic and political geography of economic shocks and long-standing political discontent. Empirically, we exploit a novel dataset of historical turnout registers across European regions from the 1950s onwards. We reconstruct historical turnout levels at the NUTS-2 region level by aggregating turnout data from the district-level to the regional level leveraging the CLEA dataset. Afterwards, we match the historical turnout data with contemporaneous ESS data and other socio-economic covariates at the NUTS-2 level. We estimate both individual and aggregate regional-level models across European regions and show that the rise of populism is explained by the interaction of historical turnout declines and contemporaneous economic shocks –proxied by unemployment and inequality at the regional level. In order to avoid endogeneity issues, we also employ the China imports shock as an exogenous measure for economic shocks at the regional level. Finally, we investigate further the historical turnout mechanism and show that turnout declines are associated with decreasing electoral shares for the mainstream left parties – suggesting a two-step mechanism in which populism is the result of historical political disaffection followed by economic shocks.","Keywords: Turnout, Shocks, History, Regions, Europe","Francesc Amat","Francesc Amat","University of Barcelona","Pablo Beramendi","Duke University","Jaume Magre","New York University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Barcelona","Duke University","New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0284_1746_0131.html","Institutional Determinants of Civil Society Organizations’ Strategic Action: Evidence from an Experiment in Peru","Civil society engagement is often assumed to strengthen accountability. Yet evidence from developing countries documents that civil society organizations (CSOs) do not only demand rights and better government services, but also targeted goods, sometimes in exchange for political support, and that CSOs often employ informal tactics rather than institutionalized forms of political participation. The choice of tactics and demands that CSOs use is, we argue, based on an assessment of how to best serve the interests of their members and leaders in relation to the institutional context in which they are active. Where government operations follow a logic of favoritism, leveraging connections may seem the more rational method to advance claims; particularistic and even clientelistic demand-making are likely to be more prevalent; and informal tactics the preferred choice. We test these arguments employing vignette experiments embedded in a face-to-face survey of 2400 associational leaders in Peru (fielded in January 2025), a context with high levels of civil society engagement, but relatively weak institutions. The vignettes present hypothetical scenarios in which a leader ask for advice on how best to go about helping the organization. We manipulate the degree of partiality and favoritism employing two institutional characteristics: corruption levels and the degree of political control over staffing in the local administration. We thus examine the political behavioral implications of partiality in the exercise of government power. The paper enhances our understanding of how the functioning of public administration influences political behavior, highlighting the mutually reinforcing dynamics that hinder institutional development.","Keywords: civil society, demand-making, political participation, corruption, vignette experiment","Agnes Cornell","Agnes Cornell","University of Gothenburg","Marcia Grimes","University of Gothenburg","Paula Muñoz","Universidad del Pacífico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","Universidad del Pacífico",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from India","This paper seeks to understand how state level legislators in India, members of legislative assembly (MLAs), impact electoral choices at the national level. MLAs in India are rarely impactful in policymaking given the highly centralized and personalized nature of policymaking by the Prime Minister and chief ministers. However, they wield significant power in controlling local infrastructure and local police, affecting everything from electoral fairness at the polling booth to the treatment of various religious and caste groups. Many scholars have noted the increased use of police and surveillance to intimidate political opposition alongside growing concerns about unfair treatment of religious minorities, leading to concerns of democratic backsliding in India since the government led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its governing coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has come to power.In this context, we posit that citizens with MLAs aligned with the incumbent governing coalition are more likely to have experienced and be concerned about the misuse of political power. We employ a close election regression discontinuity design with data from the Indian Election Survey 2024 (IES 2024), a large, representative post poll around the 2024 Indian national election, to test these assertions. We find that the projected vote share of the incumbent NDA coalition drops by 5 percentage points in the national election when the MLA is from the incumbent NDA coalition. Further analyses confirm that citizens with MLAs from the NDA are more concerned about democratic legitimacy and the mistreatment of Muslim minorities in India.","Keywords: India, Democracy, Federalism, Elections,  Minorities","Neelanjan Sircar","Neelanjan Sircar","Division of Social Sciences, Ahmedabad University","Gurkirat Singh Juneja","Centre for Policy Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Division of Social Sciences, Ahmedabad University","Centre for Policy Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0286_1137_0337.html","Tentacles of the Petrostate: Adding Pipelines to the study of civil war","Previous research on the conflict risks associated with oil and gas has largely focused on extraction regions, overlooking the critical role of transportation infrastructure in the oil-conflict nexus. This omission is surprising given the prominent role that pipelines have played in both international and civil conflicts. This paper introduces GeoPIPE, a new geo-spatial and historical dataset that integrates oil and gas production and transportation data. The dataset ranges from 1945 to 2020 and covers all countries outside the OECD. By employing a novel method called pipeline-field-links (PFLs), GeoPIPE combines three publicly available datasets to provide a more comprehensive understanding of petroleum-related conflict dynamics. The dataset not only incorporates the previously neglected transport dimension but also enhances the temporal accuracy of existing field data. GeoPIPE thus enables researchers to better identify oil and gas fields of high strategic importance and to determine the type of fuel produced at specific points in time. An initial analysis reveals that pipelines are just as likely as extraction fields to be targeted by terrorist attacks. However, a significant distinction emerges regarding the type of fuel involved: only oil fields and oil pipelines appear to be primary targets for such attacks. These results demonstrate the importance of pipelines for understanding the oil-conflict nexus and offer new insights into the mechanisms driving petroleum-related violence.","Keywords: Spatial data, Pipelines, Extraction, Petrostates, Terrorism","Yaron Weissberg","Yaron Weissberg",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0287_2267_0236.html","The Political Economy of Green Infrastructure: Electoral dynamics of green energy projects.","Do green projects inevitably result in electoral backlash? Under what circumstances can politicians mitigate these costs or even transform them into electoral rewards? As an urgent response to the climate crisis, green energy projects are essential for reducing dependence on polluting resources. However, these projects are often seen as disruptive and evoke NIMBY reactions. Unlike public goods, which typically provide localized benefits while spreading costs broadly through taxation, green infrastructure imposes concentrated local costs while offering widely diffused environmental benefits. This paper takes a step back and reassess this narrative by exploring the contexts in which they generate benefits or grievances for residents, highlighting how these dynamics mediate electoral consequences. While their psychological costs may spark place-based resentment, particularly in rural areas where identity and autonomy feel threatened, local economic and political conditions can reshape perceptions. Direct economic benefits in declining areas may offset grievances. Simultaneously, forward-looking local politicians can leverage increased budgets from these projects to implement compensatory policies, mitigating discontent. These effects shape how citizens perceive green projects and their support for incumbents. Using a novel dataset on wind and solar park construction in Spain (2000–2024) and census-track electoral results, this paper examines whether incumbents face electoral losses in affected areas but gain support elsewhere, with differential responses between deprived and economically vibrant areas. By employing causal inference methods, the study stresses the importance of understanding how green projects interact with socio-economic and political contexts, offering critical insights into the electoral dynamics of sustainability transitions.","Keywords: Green politics, accountability, NIMBY, electoral backlash, compensation policies","ÁLVARO SAN ROMÁN DEL POZUELO","ÁLVARO SAN ROMÁN DEL POZUELO",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Analyses of heterogeneity show that this effect is particularly strong in a left-wing neigbourhood. These findings contribute to theories about peer pressure and social punishment, providing evidence of how those processes can extend to the expression of different political views. They provide new insights into the micro-level mechanisms that underpin broader political trends, particularly the rapid and sometimes unexpected electoral growth of far-right parties.","Keywords: democratic norms, social sanctions, norm enforcement, Trump, United States","Vicente Valentim","Vicente Valentim","IE University","Giuliano Formisano","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IE University","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, to encourage and facilitate this sort of behavior, we need to know more about what motivates both producers of online hostility and those who engage in counter-speech against it. In this paper, we compare motivations and characteristics of these two groups – online hostile- and counter-speakers – and show that they are in many ways similar. Both groups are very vocal about their partisan stance, are frustrated by political institutions and perceive engagement in online political discussions as a form of modern, everyday political participation. Across different methods (qualitative analysis of 41 interviews with Danish online hostile- and counter-speakers; quantitative analysis of survey data from 20,263 Danish social media users; computational analysis of Twitter data from 5719 Danes), we consistently find that the people who post hostile content online are eerily like the people who post content intended to counter it – for some they may even be the same people posting at different points in time. The line between ‘haters’ and ‘counter-speakers’ is not always as clear as we may have thought. We discuss the implications of these findings for the feasibility of counter-speech as a strategy of content moderation in the context of political discussions.","Keywords: partisanship, counter-speech, online hostility, political discussion","Jesper Rasmussen, Lasse Lindekilde","Tanja Marie Hansen","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Jesper Rasmussen","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Simon Tobias Karg","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Michael Bang Petersen","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Lasse Lindekilde","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that philanthropy can reduce support for taxing the wealthy by enhancing perceptions of their benevolence and contribution to social welfare.

Aligned with the proposed mechanisms, they also view more positively both the benevolence and material contribution of the super-rich. The higher philanthropy treatment, however, does not negatively affect views on the state as the main institution re sponsible for redistribution. The preference for reduced taxes on philanthropic super-rich individuals is seen as a reward to them, rather than a reaction against the government’s role.

"abstract_0292_1311_0477.html","Coercive Incentives: How enslavers repressed protest by enslaved laborers","How did enslavers maintain a system that violently extracted labor out of unwilling participants? In previous work, I model two ways that enslavers discouraged laborers' escape - ex ante incentives and ex post pursuit. There, enslavers choose how much to invest in pursuing runaways, but the level of plantation incentives are exogenously determined at the beginning of the game. Now, I extend that model by endogenizing incentives: enslavers also choose how to incentivize productivity on the plantation. Preliminary results indicate that enslavers may allocate their resources across both plantation incentives and pursuit: instead of offering more plantation incentives to prevent escape altogether, they spend some resources on incentives and some on pursuing highly-skilled laborers who escape. The model also shows that enslavers' investments in incentives on the plantation do not strictly deter protest. Instead, the highest levels of plantation incentives are coincident with running, not with staying. Finally, I find that, under some conditions, increases in the profitability of plantation agriculture are associated with lower production of said agriculture. The law of supply does not hold, and it is because protest by the enslaved mediated the effect of external economic conditions on enslavers' profits. As such, the model affirms the power of enslaved laborers to affect economic outcomes on antebellum plantations.","Keywords: slavery, protest, repression","Trellace Lawrimore","Trellace Lawrimore",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"NYU Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the specific effects of intergenerational social mobility on political engagement, as well as the mechanisms driving this relationship, remain underexplored. In this paper, we argue that upward social mobility enhances the sense of belonging in the host society, which in turn positively affects political participation.

While there is a vast body of scholarly knowledge on the extent of societal polarization and its consequences, such as partisan prejudice and the embrace of undemocratic behavior, our interpretations of this phenomenon is derived from almost exclusively a single survey item: the like-dislike scale of party supporters. Despite the potential implications of societal polarization for democracies, the existing measurement tools have not been sufficiently studied. In this research, we argue that the measurement tools used to estimate societal polarization are crucial for understanding out-partisan hostility. We propose new measurements to capture out-partisan hostility and compare them with the traditional measurement using like-dislike scale. We test and validate these new measures via an experimental study, where respondents are randomly asked different measurement items to capture affect towards party supporters. Subsequently, we experimentally investigate how different measurement tools used to capture societal polarization influence our interpretations of whether societal polarization leads to undemocratic behavior and discrimination against out-partisans.

"abstract_0296_2063_1226.html","Media Control and Opposition-Oriented Propaganda and Censorship","How does media control by the incumbent shape political competition? In backsliding democracies and competitive authoritarian regimes, media control—via censorship and propaganda—serves as a powerful tool for incumbents to guarantee regime stability. While past research has focused on propaganda and censorship related to incumbent performance or censorship to limit opposition collective action such as protests, this paper shifts attention to its use to undermine opposition electoral challenge. I propose that opposition parties’ or coalitions’ coverage in regime-controlled media is consciously leveraged to undermine their electoral chances, and its specific form depends on the level of opposition electoral threat. The regime faces a tradeoff in its choice: denying platform and coverage to the opposition (censorship) can prevent information spread but cannot shape voters’ beliefs, while smear campaigns (propaganda) shape beliefs but risk backlash. As a result, censorship dominates when opposition parties pose minimal electoral threat while anti-opposition propaganda does when the opposition enjoys high support.Empirically, I use a staggered difference-in-differences that exploits a quasi-natural experiment: incumbent-affiliated elites’ sequential capture of all local newspapers between 2015-2018 in Hungary, a pivotal example of media capture under democratic erosion. I apply advanced text analysis techniques to a new corpus of 2 million news articles to identify opposition-oriented censorship and propaganda and use electoral and polling data to measure electoral threat. The findings confirm the hypotheses and provide new insights into how autocratic incumbents use media control to mitigate electoral threats to regime stability, illuminating the challenges of opposition success and (re-)democratization.","Keywords: media control, propaganda, censorship, party competition, text analysis","Hanna Folsz","Hanna Folsz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0297_1958_0713.html","Do Economic Decline Messages Activate Resentment and Nativism? A Regional Perspective","Geographical and economic divides in Western democracies have intensified radical right-wing populist attitudes (RWPP), such as resentment, nativism, and populism. Rooted in grievances about economic decline, these attitudes are often reinforced by strong local identities, particularly in rural or economically struggling regions. Media coverage of economic downturns plays a crucial role in shaping these perceptions, alongside actual economic conditions.This project, planned for winter 2025, investigates whether exposure to economic decline messages activates RWPP attitudes. It also examines how local identity and residency type (urban vs. rural) moderate these effects. The study will draw on a CRSH-funded survey conducted across France, Denmark, Germany, and the UK, stratified by urbanity type and local economic condition. A semi-experimental design will be used, involving a control group (receiving no or unrelated messages) and a treatment group (exposed to bad economic news). Participants' political attitudes, including resentment and nativism, will be assessed post-treatment.The objectives are threefold: first, to test whether bad economic news directly increases RWPP attitudes; second, to evaluate the moderating effects of local identity and residency type; and third, to explore geographical variations in responses. By integrating survey and experimental approaches, this project aims to provide insights into how economic and place-based factors shape political attitudes in different regional contexts.","Keywords: Electoral Geography, Right-Wing Populism, Economic Insecurity","Valentin Pautonnier","Valentin Pautonnier",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Université de Montréal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0298_1337_0739.html","[EU_CDP]. Multilevel cueing: Experimental evidence on cueing effects in support for domestic and EU defense policies","One of the ways in which elites can influence the public acceptance of policies is through cueing. First, the literature claims that such cueing works well in EU politics because people lack information on European policies and because these are less salient than national ones, but is cueing really stronger in EU politics than in domestic politics if compared directly and, if so, to what extent? Second, the literature emphasizes that national level actors do the cueing when it comes to EU politics, but do EU level actors also have cueing power in swaying the opinion of domestic publics and in what ways? This paper examines the extent to which the public acceptance of new policies in the defense domain at the EU and Member States level is susceptible to cueing. To this end, I field a pre-registered factorial survey experiment in 16 EU countries (~ 32,000 respondents) varying three factors. The first factor introduces policy proposals which involve strengthening security and defense at either the European or the national level.

Generally, I expect cues to work better for European policies given their low salience and cues from the government to have a stronger effect than cues from the European Commission.

"abstract_0299_2157_0799.html","Technocrats, experts or outsiders? What parties seek in their ministers","The technocracy literature often assumes that political parties appoint technocratic ministers primarily because their lack of affiliation with the nominating party helps to shift blame during challenging periods, such as political or economic crises. Yet, technocrats may also be selected for their expertise to enhance government legitimacy and to provide more effective policy solutions. These dimensions—party independence and technical expertise—are frequently conflated in the empirical literature, making it challenging to discern whether and when parties prioritize ministers’ independence from party politics or their specialized skills. To address this gap, we introduce fine-grained measures of the two defining traits of technocratic ministers – party outsiderness and expertise – based on detailed biographical data. This approach allows us to disentangle these dimensions and to better understand the specific motivations driving technocratic appointments in different situations. We propose that prioritizing one dimension over the other reflects distinct appointment strategies by political parties. Drawing on biographical data of ministers from six European democracies (Germany, France, Austria, Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland) covering multiple decades, we test hypotheses on how various types of crises, along with party-system and party-level factors, influence appointments of party outsiders and experts to ministerial office. Results contribute novel perspectives on technocratic appointments and carry important implications for government legitimacy and accountability.","Keywords: technocracy, ministerial appointments, political parties, crisis, representation","Matthias Kaltenegger","Jeanne Marlier","University of Vienna"," Matthias Kaltenegger","University of Vienna"," Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik","University of Vienna","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0300_2431_1278.html","Canary In The Coal Mine: Hostile elite political communication as a predictor for democratic deconsolidation?","Scholars have decried the decline of democracy in several supposed consolidated democracies, such as Hungary and Poland. Democratic deconsolidation is often explored through rising anti-democratic attitudes among citizens. The literature on this topic shows that citizens tend to take cues from political elites expressing anti-democratic sentiments, highlighting the necessity to center communication by political elites as a possible driver of democratic deconsolidation. Even in democracies that appear stable, political elite communication may not always adhere to democratic ideals. We argue that hostile rhetoric of political elites should not be dismissed as mere words, as it may serve as a canary in the coal mine for democratic decline. Using variables from the V-Dem dataset and the Negative Campaigning Comparative Expert Survey (NEGex), we investigate the predictive value of hostile rhetoric by political elites for democratic decline. Preliminary results show that drops in liberal democracy scores are regularly preceded by an increase in hostile rhetoric several years before. By mapping the relationship between hostile rhetoric and democratic deconsolidation across different political contexts - and possibly exploring showing time frames after which an increase in hostile rhetoric is followed by democratic decline - we contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to democratic erosion, so early warning signs can be perceived as such.","Keywords: democratic deconsolidation, liberal democracy, political communication, political elites, hostile rhetoric","Myrte van der Zwet","Myrte van der Zwet","Ghent University","Anna Kern","Ghent University","Alessandro Nai","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ghent University","University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0301_1464_1345.html","Discrimination by opinion? Consequences of issue-based affective polarization for democratic society","There is increasing concern that affective polarization has the potential to undermine democratic norms and social cohesion. In this research plan, we extend the idea of affective polarization, not through partisanship, but through identification with two opinion-based groups, namely on the issues of migration and vaccination, and investigate whether such affective divisions across political camps have negative implications for social cohesion and democratic norms as pivotal cornerstones of democracy. We argue that individuals may develop opinion-based identification with others who share the same opinion, and that this identification may extend to affective biases in non-political situations. In  turn, affective biases may undermine citizens’ support for democratic norms and tolerance. To investigate these arguments, we conduct a threefold empirical study. First, we use a conjoint experiment that allows us to investigate how opinion-based identities causally shape social interactions outside the political realm. Second, we use cross-sectional survey data from Switzerland to scrutinize the role of identity in shaping affective polarization in the context of political issues beyond partisanship. Third, to provide causal evidence on the relationship between different forms of affective polarization and democratic norms, we propose an original survey experiment that modifies the traditional trust game in order to causally induce variation in affective polarization. This should allow us to investigate how opinion-based and partisan affective polarization causally shape tolerance and democratic norms.","Keywords: Affective Polarization, Survey Experiment, Social Identity, Democratic norms","Maximilian Filsinger","Maximilian Filsinger","ESPOL-LAB, Université Catholique de Lille","Alina Zumbrunn","Institute of Political Science, University of Bern","Markus Freitag","Institute of Political Science, University of Bern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESPOL-LAB, Université Catholique de Lille","Institute of Political Science, University of Bern",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0302_2305_0871.html","International Elites or Local Activism: Assessing the International Network behind the Belgian Truth and Reconciliation Commission","This paper investigates the international network underpinning the Belgian Parliamentary Commission on Colonial Past, analyzing the involvement of transnational and international actors during its establishment, implementation, and functioning. Drawing on global governance and transnational justice theories, it examines how international institutions and victim groups shape national transitional justice mechanisms. These mechanisms, often embedded in broader global contexts, are influenced by transnational dynamics that extend beyond national borders, including the interplay of international institutions, norms and local demands for justice.The central argument posits that international and transnational actors play critical roles at multiple stages of transitional justice mechanisms, from design to operationalization and performance. Specifically, the paper argues that UN frameworks and advocacy by transnational groups were instrumental in legitimizing the Commission, shaping its mandate, and maintaining its functioning. These actors bridged local and global dimensions of justice, demanding the Commission's alignment with international norms while addressing specific historical grievances tied to Belgium’s colonial past.Empirically, the paper examines records, interviews, and secondary sources to trace the involvement of key actors such as the United Nations, international NGOs, and Congolese diaspora groups. It also explores the dynamics of stakeholder engagement, assessing how these networks mediated between global expectations and domestic constraints.The case of the Belgian Commission shows that national transitional justice initiatives are embedded in a broader ecosystem of international influence. It highlights the crucial role of inter- and transnational actors in enabling institutional legitimacy, fostering victim participation, and facilitating cross-border accountability for redressing historic violence in national context.","Keywords: Transitional justice, International Networks, UN, Colonial Past","Lina Schneider","Lina Schneider",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Goethe University Frankfurt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0303_0689_1348.html","Who should govern on climate? Experimental evidence on citizens permissiveness of non-democratic decision-making under climate threat","There is widespread concern that climate change will pressure the stability of democracies. Theorists argue that as the consequences of climate change become more immediate, citizens might question the legitimacy of existing institutions to fulfill their basic responsibilities and might permit or even demand non-democratic decision-making. This paper tests this theoretical concern by investigating whether citizens perceive non-democratic decision-making as legitimate in addressing climate change, particularly in the face of climate threats. We conduct survey experiments in the Netherlands and Italy (N=6000), exposing respondents to a vignette with coastline flooding projections due to sea level rise in the EU and various decision-making scenarios, including representative, technocratic, and executive decision-making. Our findings reveal that citizens in both countries are highly supportive of expert governance on climate policy, even if they oppose more progressive climate measures. Additionally, we find that priming climate threat further boosts support for executive decision-making but not for technocracy. Importantly, the perceived legitimacy of technocratic and executive decision-making is uncoupled from citizens' perceptions of the democratic quality of the process. While citizens recognize that expert and executive decision-making is less democratic, they still consider particularly expert decision-making a fairer and more acceptable approach to climate policy decisions.","Keywords: Climate change; decision-making preferences; democratic commitment; threat; experiment","Lisanne de Blok","Lisanne de Blok","Utrecht University","Hannah Werner","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Utrecht University","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0304_1611_0943.html","Why a conjoint? Methodological discussion on its advantages for affective polarization research","Studies on affective polarization have traditionally discussed which causal mechanisms have the greatest influence on the phenomenon. In particular, it has been debated whether partisan identity is more important than ideological and issue positions or the other way around. Without an experimental approach, the evidence is contradictory and sometimes too dependent on the national context. However, in this paper I argue that the conjoint design is the best possible alternative to resolve a far-reaching debate and I use for this purpose an example of a conjoint experiment applied to a representative sample of the Spanish population. In my conjoint experiment, participants were asked to show their preference for a potential boyfriend/girlfriend.  Each profile was composed by combining different attributes including: the party the person voted for, their ideology, some social identities (religiosity, economic class and territorial feelings) and their position on different issues.The paper also discusses why it is preferable to measure the results of the experiment using a Bayesian hierarchical (HB) model. Unlike the aggregate multinomial logit (MNL) model, the HB model allows us to calculate utilities at the individual level and, at the same time, the utilities form a distribution between that is governed by meta-parameters. The analyses carried out, using the 'ChoiceModelR' package, which applies Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to estimate a hierarchical multinomial Logit model with a normal heterogeneity distribution, address some of the weaknesses of classical regression and AMCE analyses, especially the effect of preference variability on the validity of the estimators.","Keywords: Conjoint; Survey experiment; Polarization;","José Miguel Rojo-Martínez","José Miguel Rojo-Martínez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Murcia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0305_0502_1004.html","Winning Over Women? The Effects of Security- and Rights-Based Femonationalist Appeals on Voter Support (FEMNAT)","Over the past 15 years, political parties in Western Europe have increasingly employed gendered rhetoric to advance anti-immigrant or anti-immigration policy stances. This femonationalist speech has been documented in print election campaigns, on social media, and in national parliaments (e.g., Reinhardt, Heft & Pavan 2023; Meguid et al. 2024; Gul 2024; Fernandes et al. 2024). While it has been argued that nativist parties, especially the populist radical right (PRR), employ femonationalism with the goal of maintaining or expanding their electoral support, scholars (e.g., Gul 2024; Lawall ND) have only begun to examine how effective the strategy is. To answer this important question, we employ a pre-registered survey experiment manipulating exposure to real-world femonationalist vignettes to identify the causal effect of femonationalist appeals on voter support. In particular, we examine how support varies by the gender and party of the speaker and respondent as well as by the content of femonationalist appeals – whether the appeal highlights the rights-based threat or the physical-security-based threat supposedly posed by immigrants and immigrant culture (Fernandes et al. 2024; Mainz 2024). The main contributions of our study are: 1) to determine the electoral implications of different types of femonationalist appeals, 2) to shed new light on which types of men and women voters respond positively to these messages, and 3) to understand the tradeoffs facing nativist parties in using femonationalism to attract women voters while not alienating existing men voters.","Keywords: femonationalism; gender; rights-based femonationalism; security-based femonationalism; vote choice; survey experiment","Jorge M Fernandes","Bonnie Meguid","University of Rochester","Ana Catalano Weeks","University of Bath","Jorge M Fernandes","CSIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Rochester","University of Bath","CSIC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0306_2017_1068.html","Affirmative action policies in multidimensional setting","This work investigates the effects of quotas, a policy frequently employed as a means of countering discrimination in (among others) hiring decisions. Most observed quota policies are uni-dimensional – i.e., defined to ensure a minimum representation of individuals with a specific trait in the set of hired candidates. Considering that in many situations, there are multiple social categories exposed to discrimination, this project asks whether a uni-dimensional quota protecting one characteristic has an effect on the success probability of individuals with another non-protected characteristic. To the degree that employers perceive different dimensions to contribute to a team’s diversity as (imperfect) substitutes, we expect the uni-dimensional quota to have a negative effect on the number of hired candidates with the other (unprotected) trait. Conversely, to the degree that the uni-dimensional quota policy communicates the shift in norm on inclusiveness defined more broadly (i.e., increases the weight of signaling socially desirable behavior for the employer), it can be expected to have a positive effect on the success rate of the other dimension. We employ the setting of a hiring experiment where participants hire a team from a pool of candidates who are either male or female and either from the native majority or from a racial (or immigrant) minority. Participants are incentivized to hire candidates with the highest productivity. We exogenously vary whether employers have to respect a gender quota in their decisions and observe whether this variation has an impact on racial minority candidates being hired (both males and females).","Keywords: Discrimination, Affirmative action, quotas, gender, experimental study","Biljana Meiske","Biljana Meiske",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building upon previous experimental studies investigating inequalities in nursing home services through digital interactions between various types of providers and relatives of nursing home residents (specifically, via email requests for information), we know that specific types of providers (i.e. private providers) are more likely to reproduce inequalities in the access of these services (Jilke et al., 2018). In studies by Jilke et al. (2018), and Van Dooren and Jilke (2022) the variable against which individuals tend to exert bias or discrimination is race. In our study, we consider both the level of dependency of potential residents and their socioeconomic status as two variables potentially influencing cream-skimming and discrimination in service access. Hence, our research questions are the following: (i) To what extent do providers of the services provide equal access to the services to potential beneficiaries?; and ii) Do nursing homes systematically discriminate on the basis of dependency status and social class? To test the extent to which nursing homes actually have a bias in how they facilitate access to potential beneficiaries we will conduct a field experiment in which family members of potential beneficiaries seek out information from a nursing home and its services","Keywords: inequalities, discrimination, elder-care services,  field experiment","Joaquin Rozas","Ixchel Perez-Duran","Autonomous University of Barcelona","Joaquin Rozas","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Autonomous University of Barcelona","Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in recent decades, the influence of unions in the democratic process has waned, accompanied by a fragmentation of political demands. Using novel data on regional-level union density across 15 Western European countries, we test the longstanding relationship between union density and support for mainstream left parties. Our findings reveal that higher union density is positively associated with support for these parties. Over time, declining union density has contributed to increased support for radical-right parties, primarily at the expense of mainstream right parties. Furthermore, we use survey data to trace electoral flows, shedding light on these shifting political dynamics.","Keywords: Trade unions; voting; elections","Paolo Agnolin","Paolo Agnolin","Bocconi University"," Massimo Anelli","Bocconi University"," Italo Colantone","Bocconi University"," Piero Stanig","Bocconi University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Claim-making is a crucial form of citizen-state engagement, with potential to improve service delivery and social accountability, but faces many challenges including limitations of state capacity and bureaucratic biases. Researchers also highlight different approaches including both collaborative and confrontational social accountability. We study these using a conjoint experiment embedded in a survey of roughly 700 local bureaucrats in Bihar, India, charged with managing block- and district-level service delivery in education, health, early childhood care, and public works. We present respondents with pairs of hypothetical claimants with randomly varying features including group size, gender, status, brokerage, and collaborative or confrontational approaches. We not only assess the direct effects of these features on officials’ choice of which claim to prioritize, but also how such effects differ across varying levels of real-world state capacity as it varies across offices. We thus are able to test whether or not state capacity enhances impartiality in responding to citizen claims; as well as whether citizen confrontation or collaboration each complement or substitute for state capacity. The survey is currently in the field with block- and district-level officials being surveyed in-person by trained enumerators. Fieldwork should conclude in February 2025 and preliminary results will be available soon after that.","Keywords: conjoint experiment, bureaucracy, responsiveness, claim-making, India","Daniel Berliner, Martin Haus","Daniel Berliner","London School of Economics"," Martin Haus","London School of Economics","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0310_0674_0191.html","Seeds of Discord: How Misinformation Erodes Democratic Norms in South Asia, PPSSDD","In recent years, both India and Pakistan have seen a preponderance of anti-minority rhetoric, including rumors and dis/misinformation, and an increase in anti-democratic preferences, including support for extrajudicial violence targeting religious and sectarian minority groups. Little is known about which groups of people are most likely to be mobilized by such rhetoric and conversely, be persuaded by corrections or rebuttals to these rumors and misinformation. Equally, how factors such as attitudes towards the state interact with anti-minority rhetoric to influence public perceptions remain key, unanswered questions. In this paper, we ask, what role does exposure to anti-minority rhetoric play in democratic preferences, particularly compared to other possible drivers, such as partisanship or attitudes towards the state? Using a multi-methodological approach across India and Pakistan, encompassing surveys, survey experiments, focus groups, and qualitative interviews collected between 2019 and 2024, we find that, in general, belief in misinformation is causally linked to at least some forms of anti-democratic preferences; however, other variables—including partisanship and perceptions of the state—are also key predictors. We further find that offering corrections to misinformation decreases belief in rumors, reduces support for some forms of vigilantism, and increases the desire to hold vigilantes accountable. This effect is not attenuated by prior distrust towards outgroups.","Keywords: ethnicity, religion, misinformation, South Asia","Niloufer Siddiqui, Simon Chauchard","Niloufer Siddiqui","University at Albany, State University of New York","Simon Chauchard","Carlos III University of Madrid","Sumitra Badrinathan","American University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University at Albany, State University of New York","Carlos III University of Madrid","American University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research focuses on the case of Serbia, a post-communist and post-authoritarian candidate country for European Union (EU) accession. Serbia is selected as a particularly stern test for the transformative power of EU integration for practices and attitudes, including post-materialist environmental attitudes. The study uses an original survey of Serbian municipal officials working on environmental policy (as the treated group) along with a contemporaneous European Values Study of Serbian citizens (as the control group). The outcomes of interest are the battery of items on environmental attitudes that were asked in both surveys. To provide a more accurate causal estimate of municipal socialisation, propensity score matching is used. The analysis is then repeated by excluding officials who started who started working at the municipality before the democratic transition in 2000, to examine whether the findings change.

"abstract_0312_2317_0239.html","Extinguishing the flames: local electoral dynamics of wildfires","Despite extensive research on the electoral consequences of natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms, and wildfires, little is known about how the economic characteristics of affected areas and incumbents' actions shape residents' voting behavior. This paper addresses the puzzle of why prior studies, holding disaster relief policies constant, observe such volatility in electoral outcomes—from punishing or rewarding incumbents to supporting far-right parties or climate-change policies. We argue that citizens’ electoral responses depend on the political and economic context of the affected areas. Specifically, wildfires can create local opportunities in economically deprived areas when regulatory constraints on previously unproductive land are lifted, enabling more profitable activities. Using wildfires in Spain as a case study, we examine how incumbents’ ability to convert devastated agricultural and forest land into more lucrative land use influences voting patterns. Drawing on high-resolution data (1 km²) on wildfire severity, timing, and land characteristics, we analyze census-tract electoral outcomes from 2000 to 2024. Employing panel data with census-tract and year fixed effects, we implement an instrumental variable (IV) strategy based on extreme temperatures and vegetation types to address endogeneity. This approach isolates the causal impact of wildfire severity on electoral outcomes, shedding light on the interplay between natural disasters, economic context, and voting behavior. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of climate disasters, while the immediate relief response is important, the ability to restructure the municipalities´ land can create or alleviate pre-existing grievances.","Keywords: climate change, electoral dynamics, wildfires, local context, grid-cell data","Berta Caihuelas Navajas","Nadal Perales Oliver","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Berta Caihuelas Navajas","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Alvaro San Roman del Pozuelo","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Jose Maycas Sardi","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Josep Serrano Serrat","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Maria Rubio Cabañez","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Patricia Lorente Labrado","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, due to their insurgent past, former rebels have difficulty reintegrating into society, often facing resentment and ostracism. The empirical literature on rebel-to-party transitions has focused largely on the functioning of former rebel parties and much less on the performance of former rebel candidates. Through a survey experiment and elite interviews conducted shortly before the 2019 Colombian local elections, I find that having a rebel past significantly reduces the support for a political candidate. Independent of the candidate's political platform and experience, voters focus largely on past rebel affiliation, raising substantial concerns for peace, reconciliation, and political and economic reintegration in post-conflict contexts.

A cross-platform study of party-level digital campaigning during the 2024 European Parliamentary Election","Social media communication is an essential part of political campaigning for democratic elections. With campaign communication, political parties seek to influence or persuade voters to vote for them and their respective political agendas. The channels that parties choose for political communication vary due to differences in voter target groups using social media but also due to a party's attitude towards traditional media channels like television or radio broadcasting. The existing literature indicates that in particular far-right populist and far-right parties have been successful in deploying social media communication to engage and mobilize their supporters and in mainstreaming their positions. Existing studies, however often focus either on only one or two platforms or only one country. Thus, this study compares the communication activities of political parties and interaction with audiences across five digital platforms in 27 member states during the 2024 European elections. We collect party activity of all relevant European political parties (N= 401) on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter and YouTube during a 10-week observation period during the campaign period before the 2024 EU elections. The results indicate platform differences in parties' success and support based on a party's issue positions. In particular parties taking more extreme positions against migration and against EU-integration are significantly more successful across platforms. On Facebook, migration-scetpic parties are more successful whereas on all other platforms Europsceptic parties are signifcantly more succesful as measured by likes per post. This seems to be driven mainly by audience support and by activity differences.","Keywords: Social media, EU elections, Political communication, Digital campaigning, Populism","Philipp Darius","Philipp Darius","Hertie School","Wiebke Drews","Bundeswehr University","Andreas Neumeier","Bundeswehr University","Jasmin Riedl","Bundeswehr University","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School","Bundeswehr University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I seek to explore the acceptance of inequality through the lens of meritocratic beliefs. I contribute to this literature by challenging the traditional conceptualization of merit in political economy and behavioral economics, where merit has largely been reduced to the notion of effort. The empirical part of the paper is divided into two sections. The first section, which is primarily descriptive, is based on an original survey conducted in the UK (n=1,000). Respondents were asked to rate ten occupations based on different components of merit elucidated in the theoretical framework. The findings reveal that respondents do not perceive merit as a unidimensional concept; instead, they attribute merit to various job-related factors beyond effort or skills. Interestingly, and contrary to current conceptualizations of merit in the scholarship, the aspects of a job least associated with merit are level of education and physical effort. The results also underscore the importance of two factors often overlooked in the literature: a job's contribution to economic growth and its contribution to societal well-being. The second section employs a conjoint analysis conducted in the UK (n=1,500) to isolate the effects of merit-related factors of a job on the acceptance of market inequality, as compared to non-merit-related factors (e.g., the supply and demand of a job).","Keywords: market inequality, meritocracy, occupations","César Fuster","César Fuster",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Why do we accept pay inequality across occupations?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I study a two-stage policymaking model in which a proposing legislator either accepts an aligned interest group's proposal or puts forward their own (costly) proposal. Given a proposal, the aligned and a misaligned interest group engage in an all-pay contest over whether the proposal is implemented or the status quo stays in place. I show an aligned group anticipating relatively weak opposition chooses to author the proposal, while a group anticipating strong opposition leaves proposing to the legislator. As a result, when the equilibrium proposal comes from the group, the probability it survives the implementation stage is high, while if the proposal comes from the legislator, the probability it survives is typically low.

We demonstrate that these differences are not driven by movers that leave their country of birth (i.e., immigrants) but are large in magnitude even when comparing domestic movers and non-movers. We also demonstrate that these differences are best explained by movers' distinct socio-economic and parental backgrounds rather than an independent effect of moving on political attitudes.

Information quality--a degree to which information is capable of yielding knowledge--has been overlooked in political science. The Dunning-Kruger effect suggests that individuals with lower levels of knowledge frequently overestimate their competence, leading to overconfidence and negative attitudes. By examining the implications of low-quality information exposure, this research hypothesizes that such information diet exacerbates the Dunning-Kruger effect. Utilizing the ANES 2020 dataset, the study tests the hypothesis that low information quality diet correlates with reduced levels of political knowledge, increased and strongly held negative political attitudes, and heightened levels of affective polarization. Ultimately, our findings underscore the nuanced ways in which information quality shapes political attitudes and behaviours, providing further insights into the growing divides in contemporary democracies.","Keywords: Affective Polarization, Cognitive Bias, Dunning-Kruger Effect, Information Quality, Political Knowledge.","Mickael Temporão","Mickael Temporão",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po BordeauxCentre Émile Durkheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis finds a positive relationship between income and voter turnout, with inequality playing a pivotal role. High inequality mobilises voters at the income extremes, while lower inequality fosters greater participation from middle-income groups. Individuals facing downward income mobility are likelier to vote, indicating that economic hardship spurs electoral engagement. These results are robust to three identification strategies: random assignment of voters to polling stations inside the same polling centres, loss of income associated with unexpected mass layoffs, and changes of income related to changes in international prices of agricultural products. The study also investigates Costa Rica’s transition from a two-party to a multi-party system after 2002. Income shocks have significantly altered electoral outcomes, particularly for the PLN, which has shifted from its traditional voter base in the middle of the income distribution to a more substantial reliance on the poorest and economic elites. Polling stations with more upwardly mobile voters now increasingly mirror the voting behaviour of the top 1%, underscoring the PLN’s changing voter appeal.","Keywords: Voter Turnout, Multi-Party Systems, Economic Mobility, Income Inequality, Electoral inequality","Alvaro Zuniga-Cordero","Alvaro Zuniga-Cordero","Université de Namur; World Inequality Lab, Paris School of Economics","Ronald Alfaro-Redondo","Universidad de Costa Rica-ECP-CIEP; PEN-CONARE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université de Namur","World Inequality Lab, Paris School of Economics","Universidad de Costa Rica-ECP-CIEP","PEN-CONARE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0320_2065_1222.html","When Do Autocrats Share Power? Evidence from Francoist Spain","This paper explores the conditions under which autocratic regimes choose to share power, focusing on the incentives and constraints that shape these decisions. While autocrats typically share power to strengthen their coalition of support and ensure long-term stability, this strategy also carries risks of diminished centralized control. We argue that autocrats are more likely to share power when the potential costs of defection are minimal and the risks of losing control are lower. To test this theory, we collect historical data from archives on the appointment of mayors following Spain’s 1948 reform of local power organization under the Francoist dictatorship. This reform marked a pivotal moment in the regime’s efforts to consolidate its rule by redistributing power among local coalition members following the chaotic postwar power arrangements. Our analysis leverages an information shock from the 1947 auscultación municipal, which revealed previously imperfect information about the proportion of regime supporters and opponents in each municipality. Using difference-in-differences and cross-sectional models, we test the hypothesis that power-sharing, reflected in the appointment of mayors who were not part of the ruler’s core group, was more likely in “safe” municipalities —those with a higher concentration of regime supporters. Findings suggest that Franco’s regime strategically shared power in such contexts to broaden its coalition while mitigating risks. This study sheds light on the trade-offs inherent in autocratic power-sharing strategies and offers insights into how autocrats consolidate power in the aftermath of their rise to power.","Keywords: Autocratic power-sharing, coalition building, local elites, mayoral appointment, Francoist Spain","Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Pau Vall-Prat, Jaume Magre-Pont","Albert Falcó-Gimeno","University of Barcelona","Pau Vall-Prat","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid–IC","Jaume Magre-Pont","JM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Barcelona","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid–IC","JM","New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0321_2333_0714.html","Inequality and Populism: How Relative Status Decline Fuels Support for the Populist Right","The rise of rightwing populism is a defining feature of contemporary politics. Whereas cultural arguments emphasize rapid demographic change, economic arguments instead point to labor market shocks and economic precarity. Crucial to both explanations, we argue, are feelings of relative status loss and perceived inequality that fuel resentment and support for parties and politicians who promise to protect the interests of aggrieved populations. We test this argument in the United Kingdom by examining the effects of wealth inequality---proxied by housing values---on support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP). We assemble a novel dataset that includes the universe of house price transactions since 1995, and leverage deep learning methods to estimate the dynamic value of every residential property in the nation. After using the estimates to construct a small-area geographic measure of housing inequality, we show that areas with higher levels of inequality are more likely to report voting for populist right parties in the British Election Panel Study and are more likely to vote for UKIP in local elections. We then leverage exogenous variation in housing transactions generated by a Stamp Duty Tax holiday for the top tax rate paid for new properties to estimate the causal effect of housing inequality on support for UKIP using an instrumental variables framework. Across several analyses, our results demonstrate that housing inequality drives support for UKIP, and that the effect is moderated by feelings of relative status loss. These findings have important implications for our understanding of support for rightwing populism.","Keywords: Populism, voting behavior, inequality, social status, Britain","Zach Dickson","Zach Dickson","London School of Economics","Sara Hobolt","London School of Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics","London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0322_2370_0735.html","A Tale of Three Crises: Quasi-Experimental Evidence on the Relationship between Crisis Management Strategies and EU Trust","During the last decades, the European Union has been confronted with various economic and political crises. But how is citizens’ trust in the EU affected by crisis management strategies in the context of a supranational economic union? This paper uses quasi-experimental evidence to compare the political consequences of different European crisis responses during three economic crises: first, the implementation of financial bailouts during the 2010 sovereign debt crisis; second, the adoption of the NextGenerationEU during the 2020 Covid19 crisis; and third, the decision of the ECB to raise interest rates during the 2022/2023 inflation crisis triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. Based on an unexpected event during survey design (UESD) in three waves of the Eurobarometer (EB), we model the effects of the announcements of different crisis responses on citizens’ trust in different EU institutions. We show that when the EU adopted a strategy of financial assistance tied to strong policy conditionality in 2010, this decision was accompanied by a significant decrease in EU trust. In 2020, when the European crisis response was based on a flexible economic recovery packages where national preferences could be reconciled with EU priorities, EU trust significantly increased. In 2022/23, when crisis management took place through fiscal policy instruments implemented by the European Central Bank, we find a positive, although not robust, effect on EU trust.","Keywords: European Union; Trust;  Crisis Management; Quasi-Experimental","Rubén Ruiz-Rufino","Lea Heyne","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","Rubén Ruiz-Rufino","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How parties decide whether to be responsive to the general electorate or partisan constituents","Scholars have long debated whether parties are responsive to the general electorate or partisan constituents. Yet, beyond the role of party type, we still know surprisingly little about when parties may favor one responsiveness model over the other. I shed light on the decision rules that govern whether parties attempt to consolidate their support base by adapting to the demands of partisan constituents and when they instead try to expand their electoral coalition through strategies that reach out to citizens who previously did not cast their vote for them. I combine election study data on voter preferences with expert survey information on party positions to study responsiveness in over 200 parties from 28 European countries between 1999 and 2019 across six key policy issues. The findings demonstrate that election-, party-, and issue-level factors all play a crucial role in parties’ decision-making process concerning which responsiveness model to follow. Preliminary analyses suggest that high electoral volatility, vote gains, and high issue salience amongst supporters steer parties towards the partisan constituent model. The paper has important implications for our understanding of party responsiveness and voter representation in contemporary European politics.","Keywords: Political parties, representation, responsiveness, European politics, issue competition","Felix Lehmann","Felix Lehmann",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg, Department of Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0324_0779_1280.html","Opening the Black Box: Which Topics Are Moderated Under Bluesky's Participatory Content Moderation?","Content moderation on social media has been described as a notoriously opaque black box, and little is known about how, when, and why platforms moderate. This paper makes use of the fact that the new and rising platform Bluesky provides unprecedented insights into the inner workings of a social media platform's content moderation. As a decentralized social media platform, Bluesky vows to empower users by giving them greater choices in content moderation. Unlike centralized platforms that enforce content moderation through uniform, top-down policies, Bluesky empowers users to customize and define their own standards for how strict or lenient moderation should be on their feeds. Bluesky implements a system of 22 moderation categories, allowing users to decide how content labeled in these categories should be treated. Therefore, the labels are integral to the platform’s moderation framework. They are assigned through a combination of human and algorithmic decisions.  Additionally, users are also encouraged to label their content or report missing or false labels on content created by others. However, this participatory approach to content moderation inhibits the danger of being exploited by actors aiming to circumvent or sabotage content moderation or attempting to marginalize perspectives that diverge from their own. Using social media data from Bluesky's API and computational methods, this paper explores which topics and themes are moderated under different content moderation labels and whether labels indeed moderate the content they promise to.","Keywords: Content Moderation, Decentralized Social Media Platforms, Social Media Data, Computational Methods","Mia Nahrgang","Mia Nahrgang",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from a large-scale experiment","Polarization remains a pressing challenge for modern democracies, contributing to growing divides on political issues. Recent research suggests that political communication between individuals who share non-political characteristics but differ on political attitudes can promote consensus on divisive topics, but often fail to materialize due to individuals’ reluctance to engage and the limited exposure to divergent views. In this study, we conducted a large-scale, preregistered two-wave survey experiment among 10,000 participants to overcome these barriers by randomly matching participants with peers who shared incidental, non-political similarities (e.g., demographics, hobbies, music taste), but held varying stances on two divisive political topics: wealth redistribution and mandatory vaccination. In the first wave, we questioned respondents about a large number of non-political topics and asked them to write a short essay about either redistribution or mandatory vaccination. In the second wave, participants were randomly matched based on non-political similarities and viewed the social media profile of their match highlighting numerous similarities followed by a personal, argumentative essay form their match. Our findings have important implications for the debate how to overcome polarization.","Keywords: Public opinion, Polarization, Experiment, Intergroup exchange","Felix Hartmann","Heike Klüver","Humboldt University of Berlin","Felix Hartmann","Copenhagen Business University","Ferdinand Geißler","Humboldt University of Berlin","Johannes Giesecke","Humboldt University of Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt University of Berlin","Copenhagen Business University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In times of war, minorities associated with the state’s enemy are often singled out as a domestic threat. What is less clear, however, is whether a war overseas that does not involve, nor even threaten, a given state will produce similar effects. Since Hamas’ 2023 attack on Israel and Israel’s initial military response, there have been increasing reports of discrimination and violent incidents targeting Jewish citizens of other countries. Do these acts reflect a rise in antisemitism among the general public or just an emboldened antisemitic fringe? Moreover, how does consuming media coverage about the war shape public attitudes towards Jews, both abroad and domestically? To address these questions, we conducted preregistered survey experiments in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Serbia, both of which have small but widely known Jewish minorities. We present survey respondents with a series of newspaper headlines about the Israel/Gaza war, Russia/Ukraine war or a placebo topic.  As expected, exposure to the Israel/Gaza headlines increased endorsement of antisemitic stereotypes. However, contrary to expectations, Russia/Ukraine headlines did as well. Yet even as stereotypes increased, attitudes toward prospective Jewish neighbors remained overwhelmingly favorable.","Keywords: Antisemitism, Public opinion, Media, Scapegoating, Balkans","Matthew Simonson","Laia Balcells","Georgetown University","Ana Paula Pellegrino","Georgetown University","Matthew Simonson","The Hebrew University of Jerusalem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgetown University","The Hebrew University of Jerusalem",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Expert interventions across economic, social, health, and environmental domains are frequently linked to rising social polarization and debates over the democratic legitimacy of technocratic and scientific authority. This paper takes a step back to investigate, first, how citizens evaluate expertise, and second, what forms of expertise they consider legitimate in political decision-making. Using experimental evidence, it further examines the extent to which citizens' perceptions of expertise and independence are shaped by the issue positions held by experts. The findings reveal that while citizens broadly agree on abstract criteria for expertise, their evaluations diverge significantly when the issue positions of experts are revealed or inferred. These results align with motivated reasoning theory and social cleavage theory, shedding light on why expert involvement in politics becomes contentious when issues are politicized.","Keywords: public opinion, expertise, motivated reasoning, climate politics, experiments","Eri Bertsou","Eri Bertsou","University of St. Gallen"," Amber Zenklusen","University of St. Gallen"," Pradeep Krishnan","University of St. Gallen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of St. Gallen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0328_1440_0945.html","Public Support for Nuclear Energy in Fight Against Climate Change: A Twin Conjoint Experiment on Fusion and Next-Generation Fission Technologies?","The transition to sustainable energy systems is a critical priority for European countries in advancing energy innovation and security. Among the most debated solutions are nuclear technologies, including fusion and next-generation fission power plants, which have the potential to play a significant role in Europe’s energy mix. However, public support for these technologies is complex and influenced by a range of factors, including economic considerations, environmental concerns, and perceived social impacts. To address this gap, we conducted a conjoint experiment designed to assess public support for alternative nuclear energy development plans, fielded among a highly representative sample of the French, German, Italian, British, and Polish populations in March 2025. Respondents are presented with various scenarios that differ across several key dimensions: the source of technological research, the level of international cooperation, the proximity of power plants to residential areas, construction costs, emissions, electricity prices, fuel sourcing, safety monitoring, and workforce composition. This multidimensional conjoint experiment allows us to identify the causal relationship between hypothetical fusion and fission energy development plans and public support or opposition to these technologies. The results reveal that public preferences for nuclear energy development plans, whether for fusion or next-generation fission technologies, are shaped by similar factors. Respondents generally favored plans with lower emissions, domestic fuel production, and cost-effective solutions, regardless of the technology type. While both fusion and fission were regarded as viable options for supporting the energy transition, concerns about high development costs and long timelines negatively affected overall support for both technologies.","Keywords: Sustainable Energy Transition, Nuclear Energy, Fusion vs Fission, Public support, Twin Conjoint Experiment","Francesco Nicoli, Merve Biten Butorac","Francesco Nicoli","Assistant Professor","Merve Biten Butorac","Postdoctoral Researcher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Postdoctoral Researcher","Assistant Professor",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from a large-N conjoint experiment in Germany","Past research shows that framing illiberal policy proposals as advancing liberal values can increase the appeal of far-right candidates. We expand on this insight by exploring whether the same logic applies to government policies. Specifically, we examine whether a government’s illiberal migration policies garner broader support when framed as measures to promote women’s rights or enhance women’s security. To investigate this, we use an original, large-N conjoint experiment conducted in Germany after the 2025 federal election. We focus on government constellations that include far-right actors as well as those that accommodate far-right policy ideas. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the normalization of illiberal policies in democratic contexts and the role of framing in shaping public opinion. By highlighting the intersection of gender and migration, we reveal how liberal values can be co-opted to advance exclusionary agendas. This research contributes to broader discussions about the resilience of liberal democracies, the influence of far-right actors on mainstream politics, and the development of effective strategies to counteract illiberalism.","Keywords: political communication; anti-immigration policies; femonationalism; far right; government coalitions","Michal Grahn","Michal Grahn","Uppsala University","Katharina Lawall","University of Reading","Sophie Mainz","Uppsala University","Stuart James Turnbull Dugarte","University of Southampton","","","","","","","","","","","","","Uppsala University","University of Reading","University of Southampton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0330_2466_1067.html","The Rise of Criminal Violence Against Political Actors and its Influence on Candidate Selection","Over the last half decade, there has been a rise in the number of women running for election in Mexico with the number skyrocketing in 2019 due to revisions of loopholes in Mexico’s gender quota law. The most recent election in Mexico during 2024 was the largest election in its history and saw the most women running for office. However, while the number of women entering political office is increasing, so is the level of criminal violence, especially against political leaders. The 2024 election was one of the most violent elections in recent history. Furthermore, as women increasingly enter politics and the violence during elections rises, it is critical to understand if there is a relationship between criminal violence and the rise of women in politics. In this paper, I argue that the rise of criminal violence during elections is shrinking the pool of candidates for political parties to select from increasing the likelihood of a woman being selected for office, especially if these parties are the non-incumbent party and will use this as a way around the gender quota. Therefore, in areas where criminal violence is high, we will see an increased percentage of women running for political office. The paper uses an original dataset on local candidates in Mexico from 2018 to 2024 to test whether in municipalities with high levels of criminal violence against political actors in the previous election will have a higher percent of women running for office in the next election cycle.","Keywords: Gender Representation, Criminal Violence, Mexico, Electoral Politics, Parties, Candidate Selection, Violence, Gender","Haley Daarstad","Haley Daarstad",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California, Davis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Focusing on Green and Far-Right parties, researchers debate which issues allow these parties to grow beyond their core niche. Yet, little is known about the relationship between issue salience and the electoral success of Radical Left Parties. Using data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey and the European Election Studies we estimate changes to parties’ expected vote shares as functions of changes in the salience of policy issues. Unlike Green and Far-Right parties, we show that RLP do not enjoy electoral advantages when their core issue (economic redistribution) is salient. Rather, RLP can make (modest) electoral gains when the issue of European integration increases in salience.","Keywords: Radical Left Parties, Issue salience, Party competition, Party strategies, EU integration.","Sarah Wagner","Sofia Vasilopoulou","King's College London","Sarah Wagner","Queen’s University Belfast","Roi Zur","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","King's College London","Queen’s University Belfast","University of Essex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0332_0879_0134.html","Legal Mobilization and Popular Engagement with Courts in China","Institutional reforms and co-optation are critical strategies for political survival, enabling leaders to secure their dominance. While the co-optation of opposition elites has been extensively studied, its impact on broader society has received is less known. We argue that legal mobilization, through which political leaders seek to manage popular grievances into controlled arenas such as courts, can also be considered as a form of co-optation. This study leverages a unique national conjoint experiment in China to explore when citizens are more likely to resolve disputes with government agencies through administrative litigation. Our findings reveal that a dispute is more likely to be taken to court when the case involves a local and female plaintiff and is filed as a group case. However, none of these factors deters the use of courts when respondents are informed about reforms designed to improve citizens’ access to administrative litigation and, implicitly, their chances of success. Further analysis suggests that the pro-engagement effect of reforms is strongest among individuals who either have not heard of these reforms or have not been co-opted by the regime through party membership or state employment, suggesting a potential complementary Bayesian updating process. These findings expand the literature on the microfoundations of institutional co-optation in hybrid and authoritarian regimes.","Keywords: Legal mobilization, co-optation, China, one-party states, conjoint experiment","Chao-Yo Cheng","Chao-Yo Cheng","Birkbeck University of London","Tao Lin","University of Washington","Chao Ma","University of International and Business Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Birkbeck University of London","University of Washington","University of International and Business Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0333_0420_0335.html","Blocking Roads Blocs Support: Confrontational Forms of Protest and Support for Climate Action","Climate protests are on the rise, demanding urgent action from governments and the public. As more recent climate protests often employ disruptive methods, such as food throwing, airport and road blockades, their effects on public discourse regarding climate change and support for climate action remain understudied. We aim to bridge this gap by evaluating the effects of three situational protest factors concomitantly: 1) the level of protest disruption, 2) severity of police involvement and 3) perceived personal costs to protest observers on a set of outcomes related to the perceived salience of climate issues and protest support. We drew on existing protest literature to develop hypotheses and tested them using a pre-registered 2x3x2+1 factorial survey experiment in Germany (N = 11,605). The study relied on pre-tested images of real climate activism. The findings reveal a significant negative effect of protest disruption and (violent) police presence on the salience of climate change and protest support while personal costs had no impact on any outcomes. Our research contributes to the existing literature on environmental politics by identifying critical situational factors which affect the perceptions of climate-related protest dynamics. Ultimately, the results offer insights into optimal protest strategies for effective climate advocacy, especially given the diversity of climate protest goals (e.g. raising awareness, policy change, change in individual behaviour) as well as their target audience (e.g. vulnerable groups, climate deniers or the general public).","Keywords: Climate protest, protest strategy, protest disruption, environmental politics, factorial survey experiment","Đorđe Milosav","Đorđe Milosav","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Heike Klüver","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Asli Unan","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0334_2372_0238.html","Green Industrial Policy and the Geopolitics of Investment in Critical Minerals","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) sought to increase US investments in green technologies and de-risk that supply chain from China by giving tax credits to products made with critical minerals and battery components produced in countries with whom the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA). We ask whether the IRA has such effects and how this affects countries that are rich in critical minerals. Do they have to choose between the U.S. and China? Or does the geopolitical competition strengthen their bargaining positions? Mineral rich countries increasingly adopt industrial policies to move up the value chain. We have created a large database of investments in the battery supply chain. Our initial results (using a diff-in-diff and event studies) show that since the IRA has taken effect, investments in countries that have an FTA with the U.S. have indeed increased significantly. We do not find this effect for geopolitical allies of the U.S. who do not have an FTA. This distinguishes policy incentives from more diffuse geopolitical incentives. The investment effect is mostly driven by increased investments from geopolitical allies of the United States rather than Chinese investments. However, there is no evidence that the Chinese are withdrawing their investments from mineral rich countries. This suggests that, at this moment, mineral rich countries that have an FTA with the United States can indeed play both sides and we find some evidence that these countries are successful in attracting investment in manufacturing up the value chain.","Keywords: Trade, climate change, energy transition, FDI, geoeconomics","Sarah Brooks, Erik Voeten","Sarah Brooks","Georgetown University","Erik Voeten","Georgetown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ohio State University","Georgetown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that 1 percent of rural adults run for office in each election. Local politicians, while descriptively representative, are significantly more educated than the general population across various positions and levels of rural governance. India’s seat reservation system has a disruptive dynamic. It disqualifies 29 percent of incumbents from re-election due to quota rotation.  Consequently, quotas not only bring lower educated citizens to office, they disproportionately  eliminate higher-educated candidates from recontesting office. Despite these disruptions, the educational qualifications of candidates gradually increase over time, with both re-running and new candidates generally more educated than the incumbents they replace. We further find a consistent incumbency disadvantage, including in reserved-seat races same-caste and same-gender races, which is similar in magnitude to open and mixed-candidate races. Exploring policy performance observationally, we find that incumbents who choose to recontest deliver strong workfare program benefits, with winning incumbents providing even greater benefits. Audit data suggest that these high provision levels do not reflect corruption. Our findings show that local Indian democracy has competitive selection and accountability processes that progressively enhance the quality of representation.","Keywords: Panel title: Research on the Frontiers of Democracy (abbreviation “Frontiers”)

"abstract_0336_2249_0408.html","Legacies of War: Rebel Governance and Post-Conflict Development","What are the short-term consequences of rebel rule for post-conflict development? A burgeoning literature documents the legacies of violent conflict for long-term civil and economic development. Less evidence exists on why these legacies endure. We study the effect of rebel governance on resilience toward immediate post-conflict shocks. We argue rebel governance can have varying effects for post-conflict development depending on how it shaped community relations. We posit that duration of rebel governance as well as the identity of the community relative to the rebel group matter. Specifically, rebel groups who occupy areas composed of their ethnic in-groups differ in their operational behavior and use of violence, affecting social cohesion, and as such, occupied areas composed of ethnic in-groups differ in their capacity for post-conflict recovery. For the case of ISIS governance in Iraq, we expect Sunni-dominated communities who were exposed to ISIS governance for extended periods of time to have a higher capacity to deal with climate-related shocks in the immediate aftermath of conflict. We test our expectations combining highly disaggregated survey and remote sensing data on over 3,700 villages with focus group discussions from communities across Iraq. Our findings unveil insights into the differential permeation of legacies of rebel governance and offer potential entry points for interventions to facilitate recovery after war.","Keywords: armed conflict, development, rebel governance, social cohesion, post-conflict recovery, climate shocks","Laura Saavedra-Lux, Nihad Aboud, Natalie Ayers, Blair Welsh","Laura Saavedra-Lux","UNU-WIDER","Nihad Aboud","University of Essex","Natalie Ayers","Harvard University","Blair Welsh","NYU Abu Dhabi","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNU-WIDER","University of Essex","Harvard University","NYU Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0338_2233_0033.html","Inequality and Vote Choice: A Broken Chain?","Over the past decade, many studies have documented both an increase in economic inequality in most countries of Western Europe, as well as a pervasive rise in voters’ concern about the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in society. At the same time, these concerns about inequality do not seem to translate into electoral outcomes. Why is that the case? In this study, we bring together scholarship on inequality perceptions, issue ownership, and issue trade-offs to theorize and study three mechanisms that may account for the failure of this transmission at different steps of the representative chain.First, the distribution of grievances: in order to matter in terms of representation, inequality concerns need to concentrate within identifiable party constituencies. Second, the attribution of issue competence: voters need to believe that their party is competent in addressing the inequalities they are concerned about. And third, the relative importance attributed to inequality: in order for inequality to causally drive vote choice, voters need to assign enough importance to it to be willing to trade off representation on inequality concerns against other relevant programmatic issues, including other inequalities than income.We use original survey data from five European countries to assess all three mechanisms on the basis of both observational and survey experimental evidence. Our preliminary findings suggest that the chain of representation mostly fails in the third step: voters do not seem to value economic inequalities enough to reward or punish parties for emphasizing or neglecting these issues.","Keywords: inequality, competence, vote choice","Silja Häusermann","Tabea Palmtag","University of Zurich"," Delia Zollinger","University of Zurich"," Silja Häusermann","University of Zurich"," Mala Walz","University of Zurich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0339_0675_1587.html","Governing Through Division","We study how party factionalization affects government reforms.  We develop an accountability model where the incumbent party is internally divided into factions which can sabotage the implementation of a reform. Voters are uncertain about whether a reform is needed and how divided the party is. In equilibrium, a united party is valued by the electorate because of its effectiveness. In turn, this might lead it to produce unnecessary reforms. We show that factions can improve voter welfare precisely because voters want to punish internal division. However, the welfare effects are non-monotonic: moderate levels of factionalization optimally balance the trade-off between reform effectiveness and equilibrium incentives to choose the correct policy. These findings offer novel insights into the strategic implications of factional dynamics and their impact on governance efficiency.","Keywords: Intra-party factions, accountability, government reforms","Giovanna Invernizzi","Giovanna Invernizzi","Bocconi","Federico Trombetta","Cattolica University Milan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi","Cattolica University Milan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0340_1119_0555.html","Urban Visibility of Islam and Immigrants’ Place Engagement: Naturalistic Experiments in Paris and London","In response to recent immigration from religious minority groups, Western countries reevaluate policies on the public display of Islam in urban spaces, with some enforcing restrictive policies and others implementing more inclusive ones, exemplified by France and the UK, respectively. However, the impact of Islam’s public display on immigrant integration remains understudied. This research presents findings from naturalistic field experiments conducted in Paris and London, examining how exposure to public Islam affects urban behavioral engagement among  Muslim immigrants. Using an augmented reality mobile app, participants were directed to notice either Islamic symbols in the urban environment (treatment) or non-religious cues (control). Results show that in both cities, Muslim participants exhibited similar approach behaviors and increased urban engagement when exposed to Muslim elements, accompanied by heightened place attachment. We provide further evidence from an original survey conducted among Muslim immigrants in both cities, showing that self-reported exposure to in-group religious symbols in daily life is associated with heightened place attachment. These findings provide evidence that allowing public displays of Islam in public space improves attachment to the city and the urban space, suggesting that inclusive cultural policies allowing minority religious symbols may foster rather than hurt integration.","Keywords: Immigrants, immigrant integration, urban design, field experiments, European politics","Pazit Ben-Nun Bloom, Gizem Arikan","Pazit Ben-Nun Bloom","The Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Gizem Arikan","Trinity College Dublin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Trinity College Dublin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0341_2546_0605.html","Family Origins of Affective Polarization","Affective polarization, dislike of political outgroups, is subject to widespread popular and scientific attention and often proposed as an explanation for social ills such as geographic sorting and democratic deconsolidation. Previous research documents the social-psychological underpinnings of affective polarization and largely focuses on `top-down' explanations emphasizing party elites and the media environment. In contrast to these prevailing accounts, we offer a `bottom-up' explanation centering within-family primary socialization. To isolate the role of family environments in cultivating affective polarization, we use a sibling approach, observing affective polarization jointly in pairs of siblings. We do so using data from a well-powered, original, registry-linked survey in Denmark that samples siblings born in 1960 to 1965, and all their children, to retain a large number of siblings and cousins in the children's generation. This unique data set allows for estimating sibling correlations, which isolate the influences of the family environment and regional context that siblings share when growing up. Our results offer a novel perspective on the nature and origins of affective polarization, documenting the extent to which affective polarization is shaped by family-level influences and its stability across family lineage.","Keywords: affective polarization, partisanship, socialization, sibling effects","Frederik Hjorth","Stephan Dochow-Sondershaus","University of Copenhagen"," Frederik Hjorth","University of Copenhagen"," Kristian Karlson","University of Copenhagen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper examines the political consequences of hosting the Tour de France, a globally celebrated cultural and sporting event, using a staggered difference-in-differences design centered on French municipalities. We find that hosting the Tour reduces support for far-right and far-left parties, while boosting votes for traditional left and right parties, signaling a depolarizing effect in local political preferences. Exploring potential mechanisms, we identify positive economic effects in host areas suggesting that the event alleviates some grievances linked to economic marginalization. These findings highlight the role of cultural events in shaping electoral outcomes, particularly in regions often characterized by discontent and populist politics.

This paper argues that AI’s ability to do so may be hampered by existing repressive institutions. In particular, I suggest that autocrats suffer from an ""authoritarian data problem,"" in which citizens' strategic behavior under repression diminishes the amount of useful information in the data for training AI. This poses a fundamental limitation for AI's usefulness in authoritarian control - the more repression there is, the less information there will be in AI's training data, and the worse AI will perform. I illustrate this argument using an AI experiment and censorship data in China. I show that AI's accuracy in censorship decreases with increasing repression, especially during times of political crisis. I further show that this problem cannot be easily fixed with more data. Ironically, however, the existence of the free world can help boost AI's ability to censor.","Keywords: authoritarian politics, Artificial Intelligence, censorship, repression","Eddie Yang","Eddie Yang",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Purdue University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0344_0539_1520.html","Imperial nostalgia in Britain","In post-imperial European states, debates about imperial legacies -- centered on issues such as colonial statues, national identities, police treatment of minorities, and school curricula -- have intensified in recent years. Despite this, there is little systematic research on public attitudes toward empire or how these views shape contemporary political choices. This paper develops a theoretical framework linking attitudes toward empire with political preferences, even in the absence of explicit imperial themes in campaigns, and presents exploratory findings from Britain to illustrate these connections. First, we find a clear and distinctive dimension of public opinion on the British Empire, ranging from nostalgic to critical, with significant minorities expressing pro-imperial, anti-imperial, and neutral views. Second, we find that imperial nostalgia strongly predicts party evaluations and vote intentions, rivaling established attitudinal dimensions like immigration opinion and authoritarian values. Finally, a conjoint experiment demonstrates that elite positions on empire mobilize voter preferences, but the effects are asymmetric, with strong right-wing opposition to anti-imperial views outweighing left-wing support for criticism of empire.","Keywords: empire, nostalgia, collective memory, Britain","Christopher Claassen","Christopher Claassen","","Daniel Devine",".

Using a large-scale, nationally representative survey from 16 EU member states fielded five weeks after the invasion, it investigates whether the heightened geopolitical threat environment alters established predictors of EU attachment. The analysis combines observational data with a vignette experiment that tests how positive and negative frames about the economic, cultural, and security implications of EU membership affect individual attachment. Results show that, despite the prominence of security concerns, expectations of domestic economic benefits remain the strongest predictors of attachment to the EU. Individuals who perceive membership as fostering economic growth and job creation are more attached to the Union than those focused on cultural or security issues. In the experiment, positive economic framing significantly increases EU attachment relative to a control group, whereas cultural or security framings, whether positive or negative, have no statistically significant effect. These findings suggest that, in the context of a major geopolitical crisis, functional expectations tied to economic well-being may supersede cultural or security considerations in shaping supranational attachment.","Keywords: European Union, EU attitudes, Public Opinion, Survey Research, Experimental research","Luís Russo","Luís Russo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University InstituteFondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0346_2419_0869.html","Beyond All Boundaries: Domestic Political Determinants of Maximalist Claims","While competing claims underlie much of international conflict, we know surprisingly little about the extent and quality of state claims that lead to conflict. Claims such as Russia's demand over Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity, and China's expansive claims in the South China Sea, represent a particular set of maximalist claims that distinguish them from more typical interstate disagreements. Despite the attention maximalist claims receive from policymakers and analysts, we have little systematic knowledge of why some states make more extensive claims than others. Understanding this is crucial, as more extensive claims are more likely to be perceived as illegitimate by adversaries and to contribute to militarized conflict. I propose a new theory that traces the variation in the extent and quality of claims to differences in domestic political institutions. Specifically, I examine how regime type shapes state incentives and opportunities to make maximalist claims over territory and maritime zones. My analysis considers the varying levels of constraints on democratic leaders and the potential audience costs they may face, as well as the diversity within autocracies. Using an original dataset of unilateral maritime boundary claims, I show that certain types of autocracies are more prone to making excessive claims than other autocracies or democracies. This paper contributes to understanding an important source of variation in foreign policy, particularly in an era where personalistic leadership is on the rise and international constraints are weakening.","Keywords: Excessive claims, domestic political institutions, regime type, personalism, international security","Umut Yüksel","Umut Yüksel",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Pompeu FabraGeneva Graduate Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Only a subset of attitudinal measures are both monotonic and discriminating in experimentally revealed commitment to democracy and provide a broad coverage, three baseline criteria that we develop to assess their performance.

"abstract_0348_0677_1069.html","A Women’s Work: The Eﬀects of Women’s Participation in Rebellion on Women’s Post-Conflict Labor Force Participation","Recent research asserts a connection between women’s labor force participation and women’s participation in conflict. Studies show that the degree of women’s pre-war labor market participation influences the odds that women will be recruited into violent political organizations and the lethality of their violent campaigns. Scholars have yet to flip this relationship on its head by examining whether women’s participation in war influences women’s post-war employment. There is reason, however, to believe such a relationship exists. Women’s active roles during conflict are believed to yield post-conflict social transformations. Indeed, recent work finds a clear relationship between women’s wartime experiences and women’s postwar political empowerment. To date, however, scholars have yet to examine the connection between women’s conflict participation and women’s post-conflict economic empowerment. This paper fills this lacuna, investigating whether women’s wartime roles deepen women’s post-conflict labor force participation rates. I argue that when women take on greater labor within rebel organizations, they are primed to fulfill greater roles in the post-war economy. Using data from the aftermath of civil conflicts between 1960 and 2023, I demonstrate that women's participation in rebellion is associated with positive changes in women's post-conflict participation in the formal economy. The roles women adopt within violent organizations matter, however. Particularly, the findings suggest women's combat participation is associated with women's increased participation in traditionally male-dominated sectors of employment, while women's participation in non-combat roles appears to decrease such post-conflict participation.","Keywords: gender, labor force participation, civil conflict, post-conflict stability,","Jakana Thomas","Jakana Thomas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that Citizens United has had an even deeper impact by contributing to recent democratic backsliding in the United States. Using a state-level difference-in-differences design, we find that Citizens United (which forced 23 states to remove pre-existing limitations on independent expenditures while leaving the other 27 states untouched) led to a significant decline in the freeness and fairness of state elections. This effect is attributable to Citizens United tipping several close elections in favor of Republicans just before the 2010 redistricting cycle, enabling extensive Republican-led gerrymandering and voter suppression—anti-democratic institutional changes that largely persist to this day. Our study is the first to empirically establish a direct connection between money in politics and democratic backsliding.","Keywords: Democratic Backsliding, Money in Politics, American Politics.","Sam van Noort","Sam van Noort",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0350_0343_1543.html","Polarization of attitudes towards gender equality among young people: The role of social media influencers","Attitudes towards gender equality are becoming increasingly polarized in many societies, especially among young people. Young women are becoming increasingly feminist in their political views, whereas young men are becoming increasingly misogynistic. An important potential cause of such polarization relates to the elite cues they receive from social media influencers. Previous research has stressed the role of intergroup threat, showing that so called manfluencers who present a world view where women and feminism constitute a threat to masculine identity influence young men’s attitudes toward gender equality. However, little is known about what motivates young women to become increasingly feminist in their views. This paper focuses on the role of social media influencers in driving polarization on gender equality. We focus specifically on the Swedish case, which has long been described as being highly gender equal, but where we are currently observing a gender backlash with young men increasingly holding misogynistic attitudes. We show, in a survey experiment that both young women and young men are influenced by social media influencer content. Specifically, we exposed young women and men to the same fictive social media content, describing a situation where women’s status in society is improving. The results show that young women perceive feminist messages as empowering, resulting in stronger support for feminism, while young men perceive the same messages as threatening, resulting in more misogynist attitudes. Hence, our results support the idea that influencers and their social media content on gender relations has important consequences for polarization in society.","Keywords: Gender, Equality attitudes, polarization, influencers, young","Emma Renström","Emma Renström","Kristianstad University","Hanna Bäck","Lund University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kristianstad University","Lund University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What are the consequences of their success? On the one hand, one might expect that their ideology is the most important aspect in determining the outcome of such a victory. As such, it should lead to more conservative gender preferences and norms. On the other hand, a female far-right leader winning an election represents a case of a woman breaking through the glass ceiling. This could legitimize views of women in leadership positions, leading to more progressive gender norms. We study this question empirically by looking into the case of the far-right politician Georgia Meloni, who, in 2022, became Italy's first Prime Minister. To assess the effects of her election, we leverage data on calls to gender violence hotlines, donations to civil society organizations, and politician rhetoric in local councils. For identification, we rely on difference-in-differences designs and regression discontinuities in time.

"abstract_0352_0208_1150.html","Automatic Classification of Group Emotions in Identity Politics on Short Video Social Media","Identity politics thrives in contemporary politics, and social media have become a crucial battleground. One reason is arguably the emotionality of identity politics that gets amplified by social media algorithms. Especially short video social media strongly convey human emotion through text as well as facial displays and tone of voice. It is therefore crucial to understand how identity politics takes shape emotionally on these platforms.Due to experiences with marginalization, self-stereotyping and strategy, we expect differences between members of marginalized and dominant groups, arguing for group equality or dominant group hegemony. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent dominant and marginalized group members show different emotions when discussing identity politics on social media.We will study this in an automated visual content analysis of TikTok videos regarding a gendered issue. Although it cannot measure gender exactly, automated classifiers will approximate speakers’ genders from their physical appearance, as well as deduct emotions from their facial expressions, tone of voice, and verbal arguments. In addition, a supervised machine-learning model will distinguish whether speakers argue for gender equality or male hegemony. In combination, this allows us to map group emotions in identity politics.As such, this paper combines essential theoretical contribution with methodological innovation to take a novel perspective on group communication in identity politics.","Keywords: group communication, identity politics, visual automated content analysis","Ming M.

With the recent waves of autocratization and democratic backsliding around the world, the answer to this question has become increasingly important. Existing studies find that citizens are willing to trade democratic institutions and political rights for material and physical security. But are individuals equally willing to trade elections and checks and balances, or political accountability and civil liberties? In this article, I argue that the proximity and impact of a democratic institution or practice will matter in determining whether citizens are willing to trade said practice for better material and physical conditions. Using a pre-registered conjoint experiment in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom (N = 3,000), I test the relative preference and readiness of citizens to trade different dimensions of the democratic process. The results of the experiment demonstrate that citizens are less willing to compromise on elections and political rights and more open to trading political accountability and constraints on the executive. These findings make a substantial contribution to the literature on citizen support for democratic backsliding by pinpointing exactly where democratic erosion is least (and most) likely to face public backlash.","Keywords: Democracy,

This paper addresses this gap by investigating the relationship between national-level mobile money activity and individual-level corruption in Africa. Using data from up to 98,000 individuals across 31 African countries, we use repeated cross-sectional surveys and multilevel regression models to examine how national mobile money activity correlates with individual bribe payments over time. In a novel contribution, our findings reveal a robust association between higher mobile money activity and reduced bribe payments for public services at the individual level. We argue that the growing prevalence of mobile money likely enhances transparency and increases the costs of engaging in corruption. Additionally, by enabling direct and digital payment of service fees, mobile money may allow users to bypass intermediaries and government officials who might otherwise solicit bribes. These findings underscore the potential of mobile money as a tool for promoting transparency and improving governance systems.","Keywords: Mobile Money, Corruption, Bribe Payments, Africa","Zack Dustin Zimbalist, Ashley Blair Simpson","Zack Dustin Zimbalist","Vienna University of Economics and Business"," Ashley Blair Simpson","Vienna University of Economics and Business","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vienna University of Economics and Business",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When political decision-making is a collective endeavor, the presence of elected women thus does not guarantee that women have equal influence over outcomes. Can inclusive discussion rules reduce persistent gender gaps in influence within political groups with collective decision-making? To answer and identify the causal impact of such a change, we experimentally evaluate the effect of an arguably light touch intervention in Indian village councils: we request elected officials and bureaucrats in village councils to adopt explicit - and hence inclusive - discussion rules as part of a collective decision-making exercise about local development budgets. We test the impact of changing institutional rules in monthly meetings of elected political officials and bureaucrats tasked with local policy implementation across 605 villages in the state of Maharashtra. We hypothesize that explicit, inclusive discussion rules, which require that quota-elected women speak, will affect the subsequent influence of these officials in decision-making, leading to outcomes that better reflect the preferences of quota-elected officials. We measure whether such changes in formal rules of discussion increase the objective influence of women officials. Results show that limited changes in formal discussion rules can alter the responsiveness of peers to the substantive input of women elected leaders, shifting the outcomes of collective decision-making. We find evidence that explicit, inclusive discussion rules matter. In fact, although they disproportionately influence women elected via gender-quotas, they also influence all individuals elected in the absence and presence of gender quotas (men and women).","Keywords: political inequality, influence, representation, quotas, India","Simon Chauchard","Simon Chauchard","University Carlos 3 Madrid"," Rachel Brulé","University Carlos 3 Madrid"," Alyssa Heinze","University Carlos 3 Madrid","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University Carlos 3 Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What are the consequences of automation for redistributive politics? I develop a model of distributive conflict between firms owners and workers to investigate the effect of automation on the redistribution of resources. Automation affects the incentives to allocate resources into politics, and the amounts of these resources shape redistribution in turn. The main trade-off comes from investing resources into political participation (lobbying, campaign contributions, etc.) instead of productive activities. I find that it is important to distinguish between automation that substitutes or complements workers, like robot adoption, and automation that is deskilling, like AI. When automation is deskilling the distributive conflict between firms and workers increases, but when it is not there are stark differences regarding the rent-seeking behavior between skilled and unskilled workers, leading to lower distributive conflict and a non-monotonic increase in inequality, to the benefit of firms.","Keywords: automation, AI, workers, redistribution","Carlos Balcazar","Carlos Balcazar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One part of the literature uses macro-level data to argue that governments do not compensate lower-income groups for rising inequality; another argues that this is because redistributive policies are heavily biased toward the preferences of the affluent. This paper presents an original approach to examine political representation and reassess these conclusions. Drawing on microsimulations, I analyze the distributional effects of changes to tax-and-transfer policies in 14 Western European countries since the mid-2000s. I find little evidence that tax-and-transfer changes primarily serve the interests of the affluent. To the contrary, the analysis shows that in most countries governments have implemented progressive policy changes,  particularly when market inequality is high and left parties are in power.

"abstract_0358_0052_1227.html","The political economy of climate adaptation: spreading the costs and redirecting the benefits to co-partisans.","One key question in the political economy of climate adaptation is: how to allocate adaptation funding when the costs exceed the benefits? The literature notes that climate adaptation provides (mostly) private benefits – as only specific communities or even specific households are adapted – but comes at (mostly) public costs: government funding of adaptation infrastructure. Since the benefits are concentrated and the costs widespread, adaptation spending may be used to provide targeted benefits to politically salient constituencies – a form of ‘pork barrel’ politics. Yet we lack studies assessing this claim empirically. This paper studies the implementation of a reform of flood risk management (FRM) funding introduced in England in 2011 by the Conservative/Lib-Dem coalition government, called Partnership Funding (PF). With PF, government matches local councils that raise money (via levies, private contributions, or donations) to fund FRM projects that are not cost-effective from a cost-benefit analysis standpoint yet are deemed locally worthwhile. Using data on all FRM projects approved in England between 2012 and 2022 and panel data analysis, we find that: 1) The higher the Conservative vote in a constituency, the higher the percentage of PF in the overall expenditure for FRM projects in that constituency; 2) When a local government switches to Conservative, their PF-funded allocations increase; 3) Local contributions are reimbursed to local governments via a separate budget line, anyway. We did not, however, find evidence of funding allocations to ‘swing’ constituencies. Rather than ‘pork barrel’, the reform appears aimed at redistributing public funding for FRM to co-partisans.","Keywords: climate adaptation, flood risk management, pork barrel, climate politics, funding","Francesca Vantaggiato","Francesca Vantaggiato",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Economy, King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0359_0327_0340.html","The consequences of grassroots human rights: Mass grave exhumations in Spain","Many countries that experience political violence employ Transitional Justice (TJ) policies in its aftermath. In spite of their prevalence, we still know little about their impact. Previous research has focused on macro-level outcomes and top-down measures, but we know much less about their local-level dynamics and consequences. Given that TJ policies explicitly aim to improve social reconciliation, this is an alarming gap. In this paper we explore the consequences of a type of TJ policy whose implementation is dependent on local factors and varies significantly within a single conflict: mass grave exhumations in Spain. Building on recent advances in difference-in-differences methods, we exploit variation in the timing of the exhumations to analyze their consequences on political preferences and the diffusion of further exhumations. We leverage the fact that exhumations took place in two different waves, a first one in a transitional context of political uncertainty and a second one in a context of consolidated democracy with institutional support, to probe the interaction between local activities and the broader political context. Results show that early exhumations, which took place during the transitional period, increased fear and polarization. On the contrary, later ones increased collective action and support for norms around TJ policies. This paper contributes to larger debates on the consequences of TJ and human rights policies. It offers new evidence on an unexplored phenomenon and provides recommendations for the design of post-conflict policies and peacebuilding strategies.","Keywords: Civil war, postwar politics, Transitional Justice, violence, polarization","Francisco Villamil","Francisco Villamil","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Paloma Aguilar","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia","Fernando De la Cuesta","Universidad Complutense de Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia","Universidad Complutense de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Past research suggests that exposure to political violence can lead to pro-social behavior in affected communities, but also that armed conflict can decrease community cohesion. Ukraine, following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, is a case where individuals have experienced various forms of violence. We investigate the effects of different types of occupation violence. In particular, our study surveys citizens living in Kharkiv Oblast - a region in Ukraine that has been partially occupied by Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) until its liberation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) in September 2022. Our survey compares perceptions of community cohesion across two groups: residents of areas that were never occupied and those in areas under occupation from February to September 2022. We find that the legacy of Russia's occupation shapes community cohesion in complex ways. Although occupation fosters local cohesion, it simultaneously undermines it indirectly through accusations of collaboration, which likely breed suspicion and division, weakening local trust.","Keywords: community cohesion, military occupation, survey experiment, mediation analysis, Ukraine","Martin Ottmann","Martin Ottmann","University of Birmingham","Kit Rickard","ETH Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Birmingham","ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, we see that respondents who are faced with a delegation decision have a smaller WTP than those who only face a decision of choosing between a pair of lotteries. In addition, we find that the WTP is even smaller when the default of a third-party agent choosing is imposed.","Keywords: Agency, Delegation, Decision rights, Gains, Losses","Carmen Sainz Villalba","Carmen Sainz Villalba",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The franking privilege has long been recognized as one of the main benefits of incumbency, providing legislators with a free way to contact constituents that challengers do not have access to. In this project, we seek to remedy this oversight by creating a novel dataset of all franked mail from 2018 to 2024 and investigating how legislators discuss their Washington activities. We use this new data to systematically investigate what activities and policy areas members emphasize and how they relate to and discuss political institutions – including Congress and the parties. We then explore whether negativity against their party or the institution affects campaign contribution amounts from various sources.","Keywords: Legislatures, Representation, Communication, Franking","Jaclyn Kaslovsky","Jaclyn Kaslovsky","Washington University in St. Louis","Michael Kistner","University of Houston","Michael Olson","Washington University in St. Louis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington University in St. Louis","University of Houston",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0363_1042_0558.html","Does the Media Matter? How Regional News on Immigration Shapes Welfare Benefit Decisions","Do regional media discourses concerning immigration influence how street-level bureaucrats provide welfare services to immigrants? While prior research has established a link between national media reporting and inequality in administrative decisions, little is known about how regional variation in media coverage affects the treatment of ethnic minority welfare recipients. Drawing on bureaucratic discrimination and media framing literatures, I argue that immigration discourses in regional newspapers influence the decision-making of street-level bureaucrats. These discourses shape their perceptions of regional immigration challenges (or achievements). Consequently, bureaucrats adopt stricter (or more lenient) decision-making approaches toward clients with a migration background.To examine this relationship, I leverage a novel dataset combining longitudinal state-level data on benefit reduction rates (=sanctions) of the German welfare program Citizen’s Benefit with regional media reports from 2010 to 2020. First, using quantitative text analysis, I identify how immigration-related frames in regional news differ across Germany and contrast them with national reporting. Second, through panel data analysis, I examine how these regional differences affect administrative decisions. The findings reveal that immigrants face reduced sanction risks in regions where positive topics, such as voluntary engagement stories, are prevalent. In contrast, media coverage emphasizing financial burdens increases sanction risks for foreign welfare recipients. These results highlight the critical role of media in shaping bureaucratic behavior. This underscores the need to equip bureaucrats with tools to critically analyze reporting on immigration as well as the importance of amplifying positive narratives about immigration.","Keywords: Regional news, immigration, administrative inequality, unemployment benefits, text analysis","Stefanie Rueß","Stefanie Rueß",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universität KonstanzZeppelin Universität",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0364_0438_1290.html","How do citizens feel about legislature size?","Very few variables in political science have been found to be related to so many outcomes as assembly size. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how citizens feel about assembly size. There are however good reasons to believe that, from the perspective of electoral reform, citizens’ perspectives on assembly size are important. Our central question therefore is: what determines citizens’ preferences towards parliament size? The choice regarding the number of representatives to be elected depends on weighing different values: some values, like representation, responsiveness and deliberation, lead one to prefer a larger assembly, others, like efficiency, a smaller one.We test these expectations about assembly size using both observational data and a survey choice experiment conducted in the Netherlands during the 2023 election to the Tweede Kamer. We explore the effect of respondents’ preferences towards and satisfaction with the oversight, legislative, representative, deliberative, and responsiveness functions of the legislature and how these influence voters’ views on the size of the legislature. We find that dissatisfaction with the functioning of the legislature is consistently associated with a desire among respondents for a smaller legislature. Voters’ priorities towards the various functions of the legislature are not consistently associated with a preference towards a larger or smaller legislature.","Keywords: Assembly size, Experiment, Institutional Design, Legislatures, Public Opinion","Simon Otjes","Simon Otjes","Leiden University","David Willumsen","University of Innsbruck","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leiden University","University of Innsbruck",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0365_0695_0614.html","From Jobs to Votes: How State Job Relocations Boost Electoral Support for Incumbent Parties in a Multiparty System","Retrospective economic voting argues that political parties receive electoral rewards for positive developments in specific constituencies when they can credibly claim responsibility. Legislators often highlight their contributions to local achievements, such as job creation or attracting investments, to strengthen their electoral support. This behavior is expected to depend on the incentives of the electoral system, with multiparty system serving as a critical case due to its lack of clear lines of responsibility and accountability. This study examines this phenomenon within a multiparty system by analyzing the electoral impact of major job influxes, specifically the relocation of state jobs to local areas, on the electoral performance of the party involved. Using a difference-in-difference design, we estimate that the incumbent prime minister’s party gains approximately 0.43 percentage points more in districts that benefit from state job relocations compared to those that do not. These findings are robust across alternative specifications and demonstrate strong parallel trends. Additionally, we apply propensity score matching to further validate the results. Our findings contribute to understanding how localized economic benefits influence voter behavior in multiparty systems and highlight the extent to which parties can leverage on these developments to secure electoral gains.","Keywords: voting behavior, economic voting, multiparty, retrospective voting, accountability","Esther Bastholm","Esther Bastholm","University of Copenhagen"," Kasper Møller Hansen","University of Copenhagen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Analyzing Inter-Institutional Dynamics in Migration Communication (1999-2024)","The inter-institutional dynamics in the European Union (EU) have significantly evolved over time. The growing importance of the European Council, changes in the composition of the European Commission and the expanding role of the European Parliament have led to increasingly contested policy-making at the EU level. While the European Commission has traditionally been regarded as the dominant actor, EU policy-making has become increasingly inter-institutional, raising the question: Who drives policy priorities in the EU? To address this, we analyze the communication of policy priorities among the European Council, European Commission and European Parliament in the field of migration. We apply a novel text-as-data classification of policy priority using trained and fine-tuned transformer-based models (BERT) on a full sample of Commission speeches, Council conclusions and speeches from the European Parliament. Based on the text classifications, we statistically model the interactions and streams of influence between the different institutions using Vector Autoregression Models. The results uncover the growing harmonization and inter-institutional dynamics in the European Union. Whereas the Commission started to communicate priorities in the domain of migration only after the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the Council shifted from a global view on migration crises to an inward looking actor, whose priorities mainly aligned with the view of Commissioners and Commission presidents.","Keywords: European Union, Institutions, Migration, Policy Agendas, Text-as-data","Christoph Ivanusch","Christoph Ivanusch","Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science, LMU Munich"," Radu Mihai Triculescu","Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science, LMU Munich"," Klaus Goetz","Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science, LMU Munich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science, LMU Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0367_0629_0804.html","How organized? A cross-country study of the structure of political parties’ youth wings","Party youth organizations perform a key linkage function between the public (especially young voters) and political institutions (through political parties). However, the extent to which parties are responsive to young voters’ preferences depends on how much youth wings are able to influence their parent party. Among other factors, the internal organization of the youth wing is crucial for orchestrating such pressure.This paper is the first to investigate two crucial features of youth wing organization. First, the formal decision-making powers granted to youth wing representatives in party bodies. Second, the organizational complexity and autonomy of the youth wing, including its resources.  Previous research has found that youth wings’ structures are related to the organizational culture of their parent party, which is also linked to party ideology. Accordingly, I expect youth wings’ structure – both in terms of formal powers and organizational complexity – to be affected by some characteristics of their parent party. I here focus on intra-party democracy, ideology, age, and size, to explore similarities and differences between youth wings and their parent party.   This paper relies on original data, resulting from the collection and coding of statutes of political parties and their youth wings in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. It aims to provide a cross-country map of party youth wing organization, which is still underexplored. Furthermore, by testing the correlation between youth wing organization and parent party features, it contributes to our understanding of intra-party structures and how they might affect party responsiveness.","Keywords: political parties, party organization, youth wings","Sofia Marini","Sofia Marini",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our results suggest that candidates get more votes from the home district, especially if they live in a district with a large number of homeowners. When an individual moves to a new district inside the same municipality, it also negatively impacts their vote share in their old home district. Regarding spatial inequality in representation, we find that voting district with higher average incomes and more education have more candidates getting elected.

We argue against the traditional view that equates opinion stability with citizen competence, and propose that instability is a natural consequence of citizens being uncertain about what they think on some issues. Using a novel survey instrument that allows respondents to express opinion ambiguity, we categorize responses into three ambiguity levels. Our findings from a three-wave panel spanning one year and a persuasion experiment reveal that ambiguous opinions are less stable over time and more susceptible to persuasion, as predicted by our model. We conduct a wide range of further analyses and robustness checks showing that ambiguous attitudes, while unstable, often have a meaningful structure that can be used to predict changes over time. These results challenge previous assumptions equating unstable attitudes with ""nonattitudes"" and incompetence. We argue that citizens’ competence should be evaluated based on their ability to reflect on and express their certainty across issues, rather than solely on opinion stability. Our approach encourages a more nuanced understanding of opinion quality and its role in democratic representation.","Keywords: Attitude stability, Attitude ambiguity, Panel survey, Survey experiment","Mattias Agerberg","Mattias Agerberg","University of Gothenburg","Love Christensen","University of Gothenburg; Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Further, throughout history and especially in modern times, treatment of women has been considered a distinguishing criterion, placing states on a normative hierarchical order between ""civilized"" or ""uncivilized"" (Towns 2010). Yet, we know little about whether the reputational dimension of gender equality resonates with domestic audiences. This paper investigates the impact of citizens' international status concerns on gender attitudes in Turkey through original survey experiments. We experimentally manipulate respondents' status concerns, priming them about a status loss or gain via explicit comparisons with other countries. We also manipulate the issue area about which we prime status concerns: women's rights or passport power. We then examine whether respondents primed about status exhibit systematically different attitudes towards women's rights in economic, political and social realms. We also investigate heterogenous treatment effects by hierarchical group dispositions and prior gender attitudes. Our findings improve our understanding of the connection between international status concerns and domestic politics.","Keywords: Reputation, status, gender, public opinion, experiment","Caglayan Baser, Ekrem Baser","Caglayan Baser","Bilkent University"," Ekrem Baser","Bilkent University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bilkent University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0371_0968_1508.html","Fairness and Fatalism: The Effects of Genetic Explanations for Income and Education on Perceived Possibility and Fairness of Reducing Inequality","Our knowledge about the role of genetics in influencing key socioeconomic outcomes like income and education has grown rapidly. However, scholars across several decades have expressed concerns about the potentially negative socio-political implications of this line of research. Genetic explanations for such outcomes, it is argued, may cause individuals to view inequality as immutable and fair. This could in turn cause them to gravitate towards more economically liberal policies, seeing redistributive politics as ineffectual and unfair. Surprisingly, research into whether and how genetic explanations for inequality affects the attitudes of citizens in democratic societies is highly limited. This study reports the findings from two pre-registered survey experiments that were conducted simultaneously in the United States (N=2003) and Sweden (N=2005). The experiments test whether partial genetic explanations for individual-level differences in income and education do in fact lead to increased fatalism and fairness views with regards to inequality. Overall, the results do not provide any clear evidence that citizens become more fatalistic when presented with partial genetic explanations. In Sweden in particular, but partly in the US as well, the results instead suggest that citizens became less fatalistic about differences in income and education, and that they saw these differences as less fair. Although more research is needed on this topic, this study suggests that genetically informed research relating to inequality does not necessarily have to cause citizens to become more naturalistic about inequality. Indeed, they may instead adopt more redistributive and overall egalitarian political attitudes.","Keywords: genetics, fatalism, fairness, inequality, survey experiment","Oskar Pettersson","Oskar Pettersson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Government, Uppsala University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0372_1594_0950.html","Uncovering Latent Immigration Attitudes with TikTok Data","Immigration is a central issue in the political agendas of many Western parties, shaping the course of elections. Measuring population sentiments towards immigration is thus crucial to our understanding of the political outcomes the Western world is facing. Traditional methods for measuring these attitudes are often expensive—especially over time—and prone to biases, such as social desirability and recall errors. This project introduces a novel measure that leverages unobstructed behaviour to identify immigration preferences: user interactions with videos on TikTok. Using ‘reposts’ from a network of immigration-related videos, users are positioned on a latent spectrum of pro- vs anti-immigration ideology. A correspondence analysis computes users’ positions by minimising the distance with respect to videos using a weighted Euclidian metric. To test the proposed measure’s capacity to recover precise estimates of ideology for a given population, the aggregated score is compared against publicly available survey data on immigration attitudes in various Western countries. Finally, I further validate the measure by corroborating the position of political accounts with expert data and analysing the content of videos, to make sure the latent space is ideologically coherent. The main benefit of this methodology is that it can be applied to any dimension of interest for which a corpus of videos exists for a given time and country.","Keywords: TikTok, immigration, correspondence analysis, networks","Marcos Echevarria Eirea","Marcos Echevarria Eirea",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contrasting this consensus, studies find that young men recently develop increasingly conservative attitudes toward certain gender equality measures. Addressing this paradox, we argue that increasing labor market competition between young men and women explains young men’s recently more conservative attitudes toward gender equality. To test this argument, we investigate young men’s attitudes toward different aspects of gender equality over time. Specifically, analyzing cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data from several Western democracies since the 1990s, we develop and test several implications of our argument. Our findings corroborate our theoretical argument, suggesting that progressive generational value change cannot be taken for granted, and despite their general progressiveness, young generations are not exempt from conservative reactions to labor market competition.","Keywords: Young men, gender equality attitudes, gender labor market competition, cross-sectional, longitudinal","Gefjon Off","Amy Alexander","Gothenburg University","Nicholas Charron","Gothenburg University","Gefjon Off","Leuphana University Lüneburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gothenburg University","Leuphana University Lüneburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research shows that women often receive less financial support than men, limiting their campaign competitiveness by restricting access to resources like advertising and staffing. These disparities stem from gender biases, limited donor networks, and fewer endorsements from key organizations. However, less is known about how these biases manifest at the nomination stage. We examine women’s access to networks, financial constraints, and competitiveness in selection. Our findings indicate that women have similar networks, face equally competitive selections, and spend comparable amounts to men. This suggests that biases in the nomination process arise more from party structures than differences in preparation. Despite these challenges, women with equal financial backing are as likely, or more likely, to win elections, highlighting the importance of equal campaign funding for improving women’s representation","Keywords: Candidate Selection,

"abstract_0375_1174_1103.html","Democracy without Accountability: School funding and Participatory Budgeting in New York City","Participatory budgeting has been widely discussed, and often celebrated in scholarly literatures on public policy and democratic practice. It is now a part of governance in at least 1,500 cities worldwide. Yet the enthusiasm for it belies important democratic challenges, particularly, those tensions arising between resource distribution through participatory budgeting and through existing budget allocation mechanisms. This tension is more clearly resolved when the latter process is compromised, for example, in the presence of corruption. But a puzzle emerges when existing budgeting processes are functioning well. Why do politicians supplement representative institutions with those more directly dependent on citizen priorities? Focusing on the case of New York City, where capital projects related to school investment are chosen and funded through a Participatory Budgeting process, my argument considers how citizens might reward politicians based on perceived competence, leading to politicians with strong reputational incentives to signal competence rather than implement genuinely beneficial policy. In the years following a major educational reform designed to strengthen accountability within the New York City school system, I use a difference-in-differences approach to analyze how citizen participation mitigates the extent to which certain decisions are governed by traditional accountability mechanisms. Drawing on data from 1,821 NYC schools, 2,181 participatory budgeting proposals, and 97,001 earmarked projects spanning 2009 to 2020, I demonstrate that school performance does not significantly influence funding allocation through participatory budgeting. This finding suggests that participatory processes may retain legitimacy in environments characterized by heightened accountability pressures.","Keywords: Participatory Budgeting, Democratic practice, School Investment, Accountability, New York City","Iker Uriarte","Iker Uriarte",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institut Barcelona d'Estudis InternacionalsPompeu Fabra University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(DIVIDEM panel)","Can we count on citizens to protect democratic principles when needed? A growing body of research highlights citizens’ troubling tolerance for undemocratic practices and candidates, suggesting that citizens are willing to turn a blind eye to democratic violations when they benefit their political agenda. These observations have led scholars to delve deeper into the reasons behind citizens’ willingness to tolerate undemocratic practices, exploring factors such as affective polarization or democratic rationalization. However, the emphasis on understanding citizens’ antidemocratic tendencies, while very important, obscures a critical insight: The overwhelming majority of citizens oppose democratic violations and express strong support for democracy as the preferred form of governance. As such, in this paper, we shift the focus to exploring the motivations of citizens who are steadfast in their democratic commitment: ‘What drives them to uphold democratic institutions and principles?’ To that end, we leverage open-ended responses from two representative surveys conducted in the UK (N=4,040) and the US (N=4,084). Using the novel concept induction algorithm LLooM, which draws on the ability of Large Language Models, we identify the key motivations behind citizens’ democratic commitment, even in tempting scenarios where their adherence to democracy is tested. Preliminary findings reveal that citizens’ motivations are diverse, ranging from instrumental considerations – such as presumed electoral benefits of sticking to the democratic rules of the game – to moral imperatives emphasizing fairness. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the motivations sustaining democratic support and uncover strategies to strengthen democratic commitment among the broader public.","Keywords: Democracy, Democratic attitudes, Large Language Models, Public Opinion, Survey","Lisa Janssen","Lisa Janssen","Ghent University","Anna Kern","Ghent University","Hannah Werner","University of Zürich","Natasha Wunsch","University of Fribourg","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ghent University","University of Zürich","University of Fribourg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0377_0806_0110.html","Do memorials reduce hate crimes and far right voting?","Do memorials commemorating the victims of past atrocities reduce hate crimes and far right voting? While much research is devoted to explaining the rise of far right parties and the surge of hate crimes, little is known how to effectively counter this development. We argue that memorials that commemorate the victims of past atrocities reduce hate crimes, far right attitudes and far right voting. By humanizing victims through conveying their personal stories and experiences, memorials challenge dehumanizing hateful narratives employed by far right parties. As individuals are exposed to personal stories and experiences of victims, they are likely to develop a more inclusive sense of shared humanity which leads to an expansion of the in-group perspective to encompass contemporary religious, ethnic and sexual minorities. Empirically, we will test our argument by relying on two different types of memorials. We examine the impact of ""Stolpersteine"" (""stumbling stones""), brass cobblestones placed in front of the last residences of Nazi regime victims, which provide brief biographical sketches of the persecuted. Using a new geocoded dataset on their locations and installation dates in Germany and the Netherlands, we employ a difference-in-differences design to estimate their effects on hate crimes, far-right voting, and attitudes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of more traditional and curated Holocaust memorials, such as monuments and museums, on these outcomes.

"abstract_0378_0515_1153.html","The behavioural effects of individual-level message tailoring: evidence from a field experiment","Political campaigns are adopting increasingly sophisticated software to automate highly tailored communication with potential supporters. This allows campaigns to adapt messages using a wider range of individual-level information, such as individuals' preferences, previous communications, or issue priorities. Despite a growing literature on the effects of message ""microtargeting"", most literature relies on survey-experiments meaning there is limited understanding of the behavioural effects of targeted political communication in real-world settings. Furthermore, previous literature focuses on messages tailored to demographic and group-level characteristics. Less is known about the effects of tailoring using individual-level information, which is an increasingly viable option for campaigns. This paper presents the results of a large-scale field experiment (N=9,293) conducted collaboratively with a British pressure group during a real petition campaign. The campaign organisation's mailing list was randomly assigned to a pure control group or to one of three email conditions: (1) untailored; (2) tailored; and (3) explicitly tailored. The findings reveal that while all email types mobilise petition signatures, the effect is substantially and significantly larger when emails are explicitly tailored. Notably, no significant difference was observed between plain tailored and untailored conditions. These results provide two theoretical contributions. Firstly that, despite theoretical fears of backlash to over-tailored communication in previous literature, individuals respond positively when they are explicitly told that content is individually tailored to them. Additionally, in line with organisational theories of activism, the results provide evidence that tailoring at the individual-level acts as a signal of a campaign organisation’s responsiveness.","Keywords: microtargetting, campaigns, participation, field experiment","Lennard Metson","Lennard Metson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0379_0274_0038.html","Local Finances and Democratic Erosion: Evidence from Poland","What incentives govern the choices of elected aspiring when allocating subnational resources? Recent scholarship has increasingly argued that, when countries face democratic erosion at the hands of aspiring autocrats, one of the most important bulwarks against backsliding is local government (Kjaer 2012; Freeman and Perello, 2022; Sells, 2020). However, the degree to which resilience can manifest at the subnational level is dependent on the ability of local officials to convince voters of their competence (Farole 2021) and use resources to build their base (Michel, forthcoming). This is complicated by the fact that the purse strings of municipalities are often controlled by executive discretion, with limited power to set tax rates or collect user fees. In this paper I argue that aspiring autocrats obey partisan and punitive redistributive incentives, free of constraints that may hold democratic governments in check. I illustrate these incentives on the case of Poland (2006-2024), which withstood a substantial episode of democratic erosion at the hands of the Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) government (2015-2023). I collect an expansive dataset of municipal finances and electoral results over all 2.479 gminy (municipalities), to which I apply a novel classification process to determine municipal partisanship. These data are used to explore the incentives that govern local redistribution by comparing periods of moderate governance to aspiring autocrat rule. This paper presents a contribution to the literature on democratic resilience, but also to the wider literature on redistribution and fiscal decentralization.","Keywords: Poland, democracy, local government, fiscal decentralization, backsliding","Theodoros Ntounias","Theodoros Ntounias",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Candidate at UC San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using nighttime light density as both a proxy for financial service access and an instrument for system enrollment, we find that the introduction of an electronic payroll system reduced payroll corruption by over one-third, with stronger effects—up to 51%—in sectors with initially high corruption levels.

We measure actual and perceived political authority using data from elected officials and their families, bureaucrats, and citizens across two states and more than 6,000 respondents in rural India. Our data reveal that local Indian politics, across the board, is a family affair. Unlike typical conceptions of representative democracy, we document how local governance tasks are collectively shared between elected representatives and their family members in both male and female-led localities. However, female representatives have significantly less political authority than male representatives. We provide suggestive evidence that this authority gap derives from resource inequalities and patriarchal decision-making.

"abstract_0382_0462_0315.html","Managing the AI Revolution: Perceived Risks and Social Policy Preferences among Firm-Level Decision Makers (FIRMAI)","This paper examines the political and policy implications of artificial intelligence (AI) from the perspective of managers in Danish firms. We investigate how managers perceive AI’s impact on the workplace, their preferences for social and regulatory policies to address AI’s societal effects, and how information about AI’s economic consequences and regulation influences these preferences. Utilizing a novel firm-level survey in Denmark with experimental treatments, we find that firms perceiving AI-related risks are more likely to support AI regulation and social investment (education and upskilling). Firms with extensive AI experience are more likely to oppose AI regulation but, paradoxically, are more likely to express concern about AI. They also tend to prefer social investment over compensation policies. While information treatments partly increased firms’ expression of concern about AI, they did not significantly alter their policy preferences. Overall, our findings indicate that subjective AI risk and AI experience significantly influence managers’ policy preferences, leading to a general preference for social investment over compensation, with firms expressing concern supporting regulation and those with extensive AI experience opposing it.","Keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), AI regulation, social policy preferences, managers, survey","David Weisstanner","David Weisstanner","University of Lucerne","Kees van Kersbergen","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Lucerne","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This trend developed while inequality was also on the rise. This paper asks: can these two phenomena be related? Could increasing inequality be breeding citizens’ appetite for populist media content? We explore this question through the lenses of political psychology and hypothesize that an increasing gap between the rich and the poor may be stimulating the success of populist media content. To test this question, we designed a survey experiment. Results from large Italian and UK samples show supporting evidence on our hypothesis — and highlight the important role of system justification in moderating the effect of inequality. These findings help us explain a possible mechanism linking inequality to the behavioral outcomes (such as electoral disengagement) that the previous literature on the politics of inequality has reported.","Keywords: Inequality, media, self-exposure, extremist language, populism","Michele Fenzl","Michele Fenzl","Maastricht University","Christine Stedtnitz","Independent researcher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Maastricht University","Independent researcher",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0384_0827_1231.html","Buying Green: How Development Aid Facilitates Environmental Land Acquisitions in Sub-Saharan Africa","Increased European Union (EU) environmental regulations have prompted European firms to seek innovative solutions for meeting carbon obligations. One emerging response is investment in carbon farms and environmental plantations, primarily located in developing countries. Why do developing countries permit foreign firms to make these large-scale land acquisitions? We argue that EU official development assistance facilitates these environmental land transactions. Beyond the direct benefits of foreign direct investment, we demonstrate how EU aid creates incentives for developing countries to accommodate European firms' environmental offsetting needs. Using Land Matrix data on environmental-focused land transactions in Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that countries receiving higher levels of EU aid are significantly more likely to sell or lease land to European-associated firms. We complement our statistical analysis with a case study of the Kariba REDD+ project in Zimbabwe to examine the mechanisms linking aid and land deals. Our findings reveal how the EU's green transition creates new environmental risks for developing countries while highlighting how powerful international actors can leverage development assistance to shape environmental governance in the Global South.","Keywords: foreign aid, environmental regulations, climate transitions, land deals","Patrick Shea","Maha Rafi Atal","University of Glasgow"," Patrick Shea","University of Glasgow","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Glasgow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0385_1063_0343.html","This is How You Lose It: Regime Collapse in Afghanistan","The booming literature on civil wars has paid considerably less attention to the processes through which civil wars come to an end. This paper tries to fill the gap by theorizing the conditions under which incumbent regimes lose wars and collapse. We discuss three arguments. First, the odds of collapse should increase as the incumbent´s military capabilities decline. A clear manifestation of this process occurs when foreign patrons withdraw their material support for the regime. Second, we explore whether political linkages between central officials and local rulers (or warlords) have an impact on regime collapse. Counterintuitively, we hypothesize that autonomous regional actors face a higher cost of rebel takeover, so they will fight longer for their survival. Finally, strategic misfires such as wrong-headed prisoner swaps change the frontline momentum and inadvertently help the rebels to consolidate their gains. We empirically explore these arguments by looking at the case of the collapse of the NATO-backed regime in Afghanistan. We match data on rebel control and violence with indicators on socio-economic and political factors at the district level from 2014 to August 2021. Survival analyses show that the fall of the Afghan regime was driven by a combination of strategic misfires, loss of foreign support, and lack of robust alliances with local warlords. These findings strikingly portray the risks of enforcing power centralization schemes as the main instrument for regime consolidation when local armed actors are the first line of defence against rebel actors with popular support.","Keywords: regime collapse, Afghanistan, civil war, insurgency, Taliban, NATO","Luis De la Calle, Naveed Moez","Luis De la Calle","University of Warwick","Naveed Moez","University of Sheffield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Warwick","University of Sheffield",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose that such policies – even when purely symbolic – have tangible consequences for the groups they target through a previously understudied psychological channel. Exposure to exclusionary policies may reduce the cognitive bandwidth of individuals belonging to marginalized groups, leading to worse economic decisions. We test this hypothesis in India, where the party in power promotes a nationalist ideology that favours Hindus over Muslims. Across two identical experiments – one conducted in the field and one online – involving close to 4000 workers performing data entry and information processing tasks, we randomize exposure to factual social media content referencing either symbolic or material exclusionary policies. Workers then chose between two types of payment contracts. Results from both experiments reveal that exposure to exclusionary policies reduces productivity and significantly increases the likelihood of selecting an economically suboptimal (‘wrong’) contract. These findings highlight how exclusionary, symbolic policies can impact economic decision-making, exacerbating economic marginalization through cognitive channels.","Keywords: Ethnic nationalism, symbolic policies, experimental research, marginalised groups","Emmy Lindstam","Joseph Gomes","University of Louvain and CEPR","Amma Panin","University of Louvain and CEPR","Ritwik Banerjee","India Institute of Management Bangalore","Emmy Lindstam","IE University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Louvain and CEPR","India Institute of Management Bangalore","IE University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a survey experiment, the study investigates whether institutional credit claiming affects support for political institutions and whether this impact is confined to the level of government taking credit (institution-specific) or extends to the broader political system. Additionally, it explores how beneficiaries’ personal experiences with the policy may moderate these effects. The experiment targets former participants of a digital skills training program for unemployed women in Catalonia, Spain, funded by the European Union’s Next Generation (NGEU) investment tool and implemented locally. Participants are randomly assigned to four groups: 75% receive credit-claiming messages attributing the program to the European Union, the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, or both; the remaining 25% serve as a control group with no exposure. The study assesses the impact of credit claiming on institutional support and satisfaction with democracy, analyzing how policy experiences mediate these outcomes. Findings aim to contribute to understanding the dynamics of institutional credit claiming in multi-level governance contexts, particularly in the domain of social investment policies, and its implications for political attitudes and democratic support.Disclaimer: Fieldwork will start in January 2025; preliminary results will be available for the EPSA conference.","Keywords: Credit claiming, multilevel policies, survey experiments","Florencia Olivares","Florencia Olivares",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0388_1060_0505.html","Parliamentary Speeches and Re-Election Incentives","An established assumption in legislative studies is that legislators are primarily motivated by re-election, which constitutes a precondition for other policy and office goals. In line with this assumption, Proksch and Slapin (2014) describe parliamentary speeches as “a forum for public communication that parties and their Members of Parliament (MPs) utilize for electoral purposes.” (p. 1). Building on this literature, our research examines how parliamentary speeches are employed in the absence of re-election incentives, particularly in a mostly party-centered environment.  We hypothesize that when MPs’ electoral incentives wane, legislators are more likely to use the floor to further their own interests, resulting in increased divergence from the party leaders.  To test this hypothesis, we leverage the case of the Five Star Movement’s party-imposed term limits in Italy. We compiled an original dataset of plenary speeches delivered by legislators elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 2013 and re-elected in 2018. We thus assess whether Five Star Movement MPs who are unable to run for office due to the term limit restrictions deviate from the party agenda in their speeches to a larger extent than their non-term limited peers. Our analyses control for debate-specific characteristics such as proceedings type/floor access rules and the topic of discussion. This study contributes to the broader literature on intra-party politics and legislative speeches by examining how term limits influence MPs' alignment with their parties.","Keywords: legislative speech, legislative behavior, term limits, intra-party politics","Edoardo Alberto Viganò","Francesco Bromo","University of Oxford","Paolo Gambacciani","University of Bologna","Edoardo Alberto Viganò","Witten/Herdecke University","Paride Carrara","University of Bologna","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","University of Bologna","Witten/Herdecke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has been accompanied by a steady climb in populist (and predominantly radical right wing) parties rising in the polls. For example in 2024, FPÖ gained the highest vote share in Austria, AfD won regional elections in Germany and RN improved its vote share markedly in the French Assembly.According to Hatton (2020), anti-refugee sentiment surged dramatically in 2016, Germany by 17 percentage points and in Hungary by 26 percentage points, indicating that there is high opposition to refugees. A rising body of literature has explored how this feeling influences voting behaviour: Steinmayr (2021) for Austria, Gessler et al. (2021) for Hungary, and most recently, Moise et al. (2024) for 5 West and Eastern European countries.The purpose of this article is to examine the 2015 and 2022 influx of refugees and assess how they affect voter attitudes. The article uses the European Social Survey database and the difference in differences methods to investigate Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Czechia and the effects on voters, making a comparison across crises and countries. The preliminary findings indicate that, while voters' attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorated, the right-wing electorate did not expand and in some cases right wing voters just switched parties.","Keywords: Migration, Asylum seekers, populism, Central and Eastern Europe","Andras Tetenyi","Andras Tetenyi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Corvinus University of Budapest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But while previous research has focused on how policy positions and descriptive characteristics of politicians and citizens match, little is known about how citizens actually experience representation. We argue that representation experiences can invoke strong emotions that are linked with an individual’s propensity to (dis)engage from/in politics. We draw on thousands of narrated reports from citizens in representative samples fielded in five Western democracies (N = 9,884) to document their representation experiences. Based on extensive emotion and political participation batteries, we examine how different experiences of (mis-)representation evoke patterns of emotions that are associated with changes in individuals' willingness to participate in politics. Moreover, we find that different forms of representation (e.g., substantive, descriptive) elicit different emotions. These findings indicate that representation experiences are inherently emotional and contribute an individual-level explanation for why individuals (dis)engage from/in politics.","Keywords: representation; emotions; political participation; mixed methods; text as data","Luca Versteegen","Luca Versteegen","University of Vienna"," Dylan Paltra","University of Vienna"," Christopher Wratil","University of Vienna","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using two new purposely designed pre- and post-election panel surveys in both countries and novel questions on economics, we assess how voters in both countries used different national economic outcomes to inform their evaluations of incumbents, the relationship of those assessments to partisanship, retrospective and prospective economic assessments, and personal feelings of economic insecurity. We demonstrate how feelings of economic insecurity help us better understand heterogeneity in the economic vote and divergent assessments of the national and personal economy.

While these negotiations typically take place behind closed doors, the availability of speech corpora of international negotiations in the European Union as well as the United Nations have opened this black box in recent years. Extracting meaningful information about negotiation tactics, such as delaying agreements, raising demands, making threats, or seeking compromise, from such corpora, is however, inherently difficult. First, the use of diplomatic language allows speakers to politely express hard stances. Second, it is often unclear which verbal expressions exactly serve as an indicator of particular negotiation strategies. Third, diplomatic rhetorical styles are moreover context-dependent and vary across different international negotiation arenas, thus rendering measurement difficult. We characterize the potential variation in negotiation tactics based on the literature and implement an LLM-based approach that overcomes the measurement challenges by leveraging case-knowledge of the international negotiation arena.

However, there is little causal evidence on the effects of direct local cooperations between mainstream and populist parties. This paper fills this gap by examining local cooperations in German municipal legislatures, where mainstream parties have occasionally collaborated with the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Using a synthetic difference-in-differences design, we estimate the effects of these local cooperations on electoral support for both mainstream parties and the AfD. We find preliminary evidence that local cooperations with the AfD result in electoral losses for the AfD in subsequent elections. Potential mechanisms for this effect include the undermining of the AfD's anti-establishment appeal and shifts in valence perceptions.","Keywords: radical-right parties, AfD, cordon sanitaire, local politics","Philipp Heyna","Philipp Heyna","Hertie School Berlin; Humboldt University Berlin","Tim Wappenhans","Humboldt University Berlin","Hanno Hilbig","University of California, Davis","Violeta Haas","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST) and Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School Berlin","Humboldt University Berlin","University of California, Davis","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST) and Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Outcomes and Drivers of Municipal Investment Spending in Germany","The question of whether the rich exert disproportionate influence over policymaking has fueled extensive research, with evidence showing a pro-rich bias. This research largely focuses on higher levels of government, while local politics remains underexplored. At the local level, studies primarily examine resource allocation outcomes, suggesting the rich benefit more from infrastructure and the poor from consumptive public services.Other research explores what drives local resource allocation: Are politicians seeking to optimize re-election chances, or are city agencies prioritizing efficiency to benefit the greatest number of people? Evidence is mixed, though efficiency appears to dominate.This paper combines these strands of literature: First, it investigates what drives local resource allocation: socio-economic overrepresentation, electoral considerations, or efficiency concerns. Second, it analyzes whether the rich or the poor disproportionately benefit from outcomes of these processes. By examining all municipal investment spending, this paper takes a more comprehensive approach than prior research.While earlier research has been conducted in various countries, there has been very little on Germany, despite its size and high degree of local autonomy, likely due to the heterogeneity of municipal reporting practices. This paper draws on a novel dataset covering 23 German cities over 16 years. Homogeneity was achieved by focusing on cities in North Rhine-Westphalia large enough to avoid shared county responsibilities and by working with administrations to clarify reporting practices. It includes investment spending, rent prices, demographics, welfare quotas, and election results at the district level. To assess efficiency concerns, it also incorporates geographical measures of centrality.","Keywords: local government, distributive politics, public administration, political competition","Nils Strecker","Nils Strecker",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Philipps-University Marburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0395_1083_1356.html","Election integrity, electoral participation and the meanings of voting","Doubts about the integrity of an election, whether justified or not, have been found to undermine the legitimacy of democratic processes and decrease levels of turnout: voting becomes less attractive when citizens perceive the outcome of the election to be a foregone conclusion. Yet, this mechanism relies on the assumption that all citizens decide to vote in order to influence the outcome of the election. We put this purely instrumental assumption to the test by examining how public perceptions of election integrity relate to electoral participation. We aim to disentangle this association and suggest that it can be explained by a new variable meant to capture whether citizens find a meaning in voting or not, and the content of these meanings. We test this using original survey data collected in thirteen countries with different levels of election integrity, all of which held general elections between March 2022 and May 2023. The results show that high levels of perceived election integrity do not affect all voters in the same way. Perceptions of fairness are particularly relevant for individuals who are more skeptical about voting, whereas those who view voting as a civic duty remain largely unaffected. By showing that evaluations of procedural fairness are more relevant for certain groups, our findings challenge the assumed direct link between election integrity and turnout, contributing to ongoing discussions about democratic legitimacy.","Keywords: Election integrity, turnout, political behavior, comparative research, survey research","Anna Lia Brunetti","Anna Lia Brunetti","University of Vienna","María Belén Abdala","University of Salzburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Vienna","University of Salzburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0396_2449_0876.html","Norm Violations and Public Perceptions of Foreign Countries","How do a country’s violations of international norms shape its image on the global stage? When do negative views of foreign governments extend to their citizens? This article investigates how norm violations influence public perceptions of foreign governments and their citizens, emphasizing the conditions under which these perceptions converge or diverge. We argue that public responses to norm violations depend on geopolitical relations and the type of violation. Specifically, the public is less tolerant of norm violations by adversarial states or when the violations involve norms related to international security or human rights, as opposed to economic issues. Furthermore, the regime type of the offending country influences whether blame extends to its citizens. Citizens in democracies are more likely to be associated with their government’s actions due to perceptions of shared responsibility through electoral accountability. In contrast, citizens in autocracies are regarded as less complicit given their limited influence on policymaking. Therefore, negative images of a foreign democratic government are more likely to spill over to its citizens.To test these arguments, we conducted a vignette-based survey experiment fielded on the American public. The results support our theory, showing that public perceptions of foreign governments and their citizens are shaped by the type of norm violation, the country’s political alignment, and its regime type. Our findings provide novel insights into how the public evaluates the behavior of foreign governments and their citizens, with important implications for understanding perceptions of democratic accountability, public diplomacy, and the consequences of international norm violations.","Keywords: Norm violations, public perceptions, governments, citizens, survey experiment","Frederick Chen","Frederick Chen","The Ohio State University"," Haoming Xiong","The Ohio State University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The Ohio State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We collect dozens of Trends samples across a grid of 6800 distinct search queries with varied keywords, languages, time periods, and geographic parameters. We analyze the variation across individual draws for each query and find evidence that smaller population size and lower internet penetration are important predictors of sampling noise. Choice of language matters: even in settings where English is not the dominant language, searches for English language keywords frequently predominate. Finally, more historical time periods are noisier than more recent periods. These results demonstrate the importance of collecting multiple Trends samples, particularly for researchers studying regions with lower levels of development and Internet utilization.

"abstract_0398_0399_1008.html","GENBACK - Homonationalist Rhetoric and Cultural Attitudes","Homonationalism - portraying immigrants as a threat to LGBT+ rights - is a key rhetorical strategy used by right-wing parties across Europe. However, the relationship between this phenomenon and the growing independence of attitudes towards sociocultural issues remains underexplored. This article proposes a novel theoretical framework for understanding homonationalism, examining how the interplay between the political identities of homonationalist actors and their audience affects attitudes towards immigration and LGBT+ issues. It seeks to answer two primary research questions: (1) Can homonationalist rhetoric be causally linked to the growing independence of sociocultural attitudes (attitudinal unbundling)? (2) Does the latter arise from a progressive shift in traditional morality attitudes occurring simultaneously with a conservative variation in immigration attitudes (sexually-modern nativism)? To address these questions, this study employs a pre-registered survey experiment conducted in the UK. Participants are randomly exposed to homonationalist rhetoric from either a non-political or a right-wing political actor. In the former scenario, homonationalism increases sexually-modern nativist attitudes among right-wing respondents, who become both more nativist and more supportive of LGBT+ issues. In the latter scenario, respondents are receptive to the parts of the message that resonate with their pre-existing preferences: right-wing respondents become more anti-immigration, while left-wing respondents more supportive of LGBT+ issues. Overall, this article establishes a causal relationship between homonationalist rhetoric and attitudinal unbundling, thus bridging the literature on supply and demand-side homonationalism and exploring the effect of homonationalism when it comes from right-wing political vis-a-vis non-political actors.","Keywords: Homonationalism, LGBT+, Muslims, Immigration","Francesco Raffaelli","Francesco Raffaelli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent research has challenged this assumption, emphasizing that collective leadership is increasingly common in political parties. Implementing the team-based or co-leadership models is seen as a way to distribute power among several individuals. While such strategies of power fragmentation may offer opportunities for women, there is a limited understanding of how gender influences the distribution of power among co-leaders. This article seeks to explore whether collective leadership models may hinder women’s access to power and influence within political parties. Accordingly, we conduct a comparative case study informed by feminist institutionalism, which examines both the formal and informal gendered rules that shape the opportunities, resources, and influence of female and male co-leaders. The empirical analysis focuses on the collective leadership structure and distribution of power of Bildu and CUP, drawing on interviews with party members and staff, as well as party documents. The examined parties are two leftist parties, committed to promoting gender equality, and with different organizational structures.","Keywords: co-leadership, political parties, gender, feminist institutionalism","Andreu Paneque, Marina Muñoz-Puig","Andreu Paneque","Open University of Catalonia","Marina Muñoz-Puig","Pompeu Fabra University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Open University of Catalonia","Pompeu Fabra University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0401_0912_1361.html","Committing to Democracy: How to make citizens reject undemocratic candidates","In Western democracies, citizens often accept undemocratic behavior if they stand to gain politically. Existing studies have attempted to counter such behavior by informing citizens why safeguarding democracy is important through various approaches, with mixed success. This study advances an alternative approach. Instead of telling people how to think, it asks citizens what they find most important between democracy and politics and how they plan to act accordingly. Given that most citizens already hold deep democratic values, this Socratic approach extracts voluntary commitments from citizens to prioritize democratic principles over political preferences, which provides them with a strong intrinsic motivation to act accordingly. Utilizing this approach in an original survey experiment in the United States with a representative sample of 6000 respondents -- as well as replications across 12 Western democracies -- the experimental design randomly distributes respondents into either a control, information, or commitment group and subsequently assesses their willingness to prioritize democracy over politics in a series of fictive elections. Results demonstrate that the democratic commitment approach significantly and substantially reduces peoples’ susceptibility to vote for undemocratic candidates compared to the control and information groups. These results offer important insights and a new way of thinking when designing strategies for empowering citizens to reject undemocratic politicians in today’s democracies.","Keywords: Democracy, democratic commitment, democratic backsliding","Suthan Krishnarajan","Suthan Krishnarajan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I report three main results: (1) a desire-based framing argument featuring lack, fantasy and emotion, is less credible than a factual argument and a mere emotional argument; (2) a desire-based framing argument featuring lack, fantasy and emotion, is less persuasive than a factual argument and a mere emotional argument; (3) Overall, arguments featuring emotion result in lower credibility and persuasiveness compared to the control group featuring a factual argument. This paper contributes to the ongoing debates on the role of emotions in politics, and the effectiveness of fact-based discourses in influencing political attitudes.","Keywords: desire-based framing, credibility, persuasiveness, climate change, Belgium","Anam Kuraishi","Anam Kuraishi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Antwerp",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0404_0802_0041.html","Strategic Choices under Public Scrutiny: Complementary Experiments Explaining Incentives in the EU-Hungary Dispute over Democratic Backsliding","In December 2023, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán lifted his veto on Ukraine’s EU accession talks, just hours after the European Commission approved the release of 10 billion euros in previously frozen EU funding. This decision reflects the ongoing EU-Hungary standoff over democratic backsliding, with Orbán’s government frequently criticized for authoritarian tendencies. While much attention focuses on Hungary’s domestic pressures and the EU’s rule of law mechanisms, the role of public opinion in shaping strategies on both sides is often overlooked.This paper presents findings from two survey experiments exploring how public pressure influences the EU and Hungary in this dispute. A German experiment examines how public opinion shapes the EU’s response to Hungary’s use of vetoes as a bargaining tool. Participants navigate a hypothetical scenario where the EU considers sanctions following an undemocratic reform by Hungary, which retaliates with a veto on Ukraine aid. Conversely, a Hungarian experiment investigates whether public pressure encourages Orbán’s government to comply with or resist EU demands and examines voter reactions to the government’s strategic veto use.By analyzing public opinion’s impact on these strategic decisions, this study sheds light on the broader dynamics of democratic backsliding in the EU. It highlights how public pressure creates incentives for both the EU and Hungary, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between governance, rule of law, and public engagement in EU politics.","Keywords: European Union, survey experiment, public opinion, democratic backsliding","Kata Moravecz","Kata Moravecz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Central European university",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0405_2323_0135.html","Prosecutors, Polarization, and Partisan Bias: Theory and Evidence from Corruption Probes in Argentina","Scholars of judicial institutions view presidential appointments as a powerful means of establishing long-term interbranch influence in settings with high judicial independence. However, in contexts where incumbents control judicial careers, conventional expectations suggest that judicial agents will favor the current executive rather than the appointing party. This paper argues that political polarization can reshape these incentives, inducing partisan bias even in environments where traditional theories would not predict it. We examine this dynamic in Argentina’s federal corruption investigations, focusing on the Comodoro Py courthouse, the nation’s most prominent federal circuit, over the period from 2013 to 2023. We leverage the random assignment of cases to courts to compare how prosecutors appointed by different presidents investigate cases involving politicians from the two main political parties. Our findings reveal significant partisan bias, with agents shielding partisan allies and persecuting out-party members in their investigations. These effects are especially pronounced among more ideologically extreme prosecutors, highlighting the enduring impact of political polarization on judicial behavior and challenging existing theories of executive influence over the judiciary.","Keywords: judicial politics, corruption, polarization, ideology, causal inference, natural experiment, argentina","German Feierherd","German Feierherd","Universidad de San Andrés","Guadalupe Tuñón","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de San Andrés","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Measuring the Effectiveness of Gender Quotas in India","Despite the significant positive implications of gender quotas, growing evidence suggests that some women serve as proxies for male family members. What is the magnitude of this phenomenon in patriarchal contexts where men gatekeep women's public presence? We address this question by developing a  behavioral measure of ""proxiness"" that is based on who answers the phone to respond to our survey --- the female politician or their family members. Phone survey data of over 1100 local politicians across two states of India reveal that female politicians are significantly less likely than their male counterparts to answer the phone and participate in our survey themselves. We validate this measure with data from a subset of village councils, where citizens (N=969) were asked to name their elected representative. In the village councils where the elected representatives answered our phone survey themselves, they were also more likely to be identified by citizens as the defacto representative. Additionally, we find that women from families with prior electoral experience were more likely to serve as proxies. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed measure as a low-cost, scalable tool for identifying proxiness at the local level, while also highlighting the gap between gender quotas and women's substantive representation.","Keywords: Gender quotas, Proxy politics, South Asia","Priyadarshi Amar","Priyadarshi Amar","University of Wisconsin-Madison","Apurva Bamezai","University of Pennsylvania","Rithika Kumar","Rice University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Wisconsin-Madison","University of Pennsylvania","Rice University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a unique combination of datasets from Switzerland, we investigate the political ramifications of firm-level AI exposure. AI adoption is proxied through firms’ recruitment strategies, derived from comprehensive online job vacancy data, and linked to household panel data to explore the relationship between workplace AI exposure, political participation, and voting behavior. By classifying tasks in job ads to capture automation-relevant skills, we construct firm-level indicators of AI exposure. This approach enhances our understanding of how technological change shapes political attitudes and actions.

Citizens and politicians perceive some groups as powerful and some groups as deserving. A shared understanding of societal groups and electoral accountability leads to similar views between citizens and politicians about deservingness and power.  Welfare benefits are directed toward groups that appear to be powerful and deserving (such as the elderly), but target group characterized as undeserving and powerless (such as the unemployed) receive only contingent benefits. Second, we inquire into the mechanisms triggering these beliefs about recipients. Building on moral judgement theory, citizens and politicians distinguish between fairness considerations and belonging to an ingroup when assigning benefits. We survey citizens and nationally elected politicians in Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and Norway in 2022 in order to test our expectations. First, participants rate six groups (elderly, drug addicts, people with disabilities, unemployed, investment bankers and farmers) in terms of deservingness and power. A model-based cluster analysis groups these responses and compares them between citizens and politicians. Second, in an experimental design, we test if social benefits are assigned based on fairness and/or ingroup considerations.

"abstract_0410_1258_0342.html","Legacies of Political Violence and Spaniards’ Tolerance of a Reprehensible Police","The Spanish police has been reiteratedly criticized in European reports for ill-treatment and lack of accountability. Indeed, according to the Political Terror Scale measuring state-sanctioned violence (e.g., police brutality), Spain is one of the most repressive countries in Europe. However, all this contrasts with a very positive perception of the police by the Spanish society, relative to other countries. I argue that this paradox might be explained by the verticalization of society brought by a long Francoist dictatorship which followed a bloody Civil War. Aiming to quantitatively approach this idea, I exploit sub-national variation in levels of Francoist repression during the Civil War and the post-war period, as regime’s indoctrination in the necessity of strong hierarchies to preserve order and stability might have been easier in those places which suffered more repression, due to a combination of heightened risk aversion and fear of a new conflict. Looking at three different geographical levels (municipalities, provinces and autonomous communities) and employing three different surveys, I find that individuals in areas which experienced more Francoist repression during the Civil War and its aftermath value the police more positively nowadays. Consistent with previous research on the legacies of violence, the effect of repression weakens for younger generations. Furthermore, I discard several alternative explanations to the one I propose, and show that Francoist repression correlates also with different attitudes argued to mediate the relationship with attitudes towards the police. Finally, I show similar results for the case of the Guatemalan Civil War.","Keywords: civilian victimization; civil war; attitudes towards the police","Fernando Javier Sánchez Monforte","Fernando Javier Sánchez Monforte",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford, Nuffield College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By late 1980s, radio programs aired by the government of the constituent republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina consistently supported a multinational vision of Yugoslavia, whereas propaganda efforts of Serb and Croat governments turned towards ethnic nationalism and sought to mobilize co-ethnics both at home and in neighboring republics. I model the geographic reach of radio stations controlled by these governments in Bosnia and find that only Bosnian-controlled media increased the rates at which citizens chose to identify as Yugoslavs — rather than Bosniaks (Muslims), Croats, or Serbs — in the 1991 census.

"abstract_0412_1941_0446.html","Governing the world: What type of global democracy do citizens want?","Global crises have increased both the need for and the politicization of transnational governance. In line with this, efforts have been made to generate public legitimacy for transnational governance, especially at the EU level. At the same time, there is a significant gap in understanding what citizens expect from transnational democracy. A recent study by Ghassim and Pauli (2024) shows strong public support for a world government. But it remains unclear how exactly that government should look, and how people would react to trade-offs connected to national sovereignty or wealth redistribution. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an innovative measurement of regime preferences for global and EU democracy. Using a survey and conjoint experiment in Germany and Poland, it captures what type of supranational democracy people would endorse and why. I find surprising commonalities despite both countries’ diverging stance on EU integration: polycentric solutions involving multiple decision-makers are preferred over centralized institutions or a world parliament. The paper presents these results and provides a preliminary analysis of their intersections with political attitudes (e.g. political ideology), and on conflict lines on European integration (e.g. national autonomy, free movement and wealth redistribution). Thereby, it provides for a differentiated account of EU citizens’ preferences on global democratic regimes.","Keywords: democratic preferences, EU reform, Germany, Poland","Franziska Maier","Franziska Maier",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Stuttgart",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Comparing factors for legislators’ communication behavior in parliament and on Facebook","This study compares the traditional form of political speeches in parliament with social media communication on Facebook by members of parliament of the 18th German Bundestag (2013-2017). While prior studies comparing political communication in parliamentary speeches and on social media mostly focused on Twitter messages, this study uses a unique data set linking parliamentary speeches with public election data, candidate surveys, and MPs’ social media communication on Facebook. The analysis examines individual and party-level factors associated with legislators’ communication activity in parliament and on Facebook. The analysis deploys negative binomial models suitable for over-dispersed count data. The results indicate that party differences and mandate type indeed play an important role in speech activity. However, when controlling for individual-level factors of legislators’ from elite surveys, activity in parliament varies with the openness of MPs personality and norms of representation. For Facebook activity, remarkably, incumbents are less active than non-incumbents and whilst there is an indication that less-party loyal MPs are more active on Facebook, the difference is not significant. The results stress that individual factors and norms of representation matter for legislators’ behaviour in parliament. This underlines the usefulness of data linking for legislative studies and calls for further research on styles of representation and legislators preffered channels of political communication.","Keywords: Legislators, Political elites, Social media, Parliamentary speech, Representation style","Philipp Darius","Philipp Darius",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Center for Digital Governance, Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Anecdotal evidence suggests that non-migrant ""natives"" take steps to avoid or seek out catchment area schools due to the ethnic composition of student bodies. Indeed, school segregation has been documented across Europe, but the lack of high-resolution data on school choice and migrant populations has made it difficult to precisely show the extent to which schools are more (or less) segregated than we would expect given catchment area demographics and to analyze the process that leads to such segregation. We contribute to this debate with an analysis of a never-before-used dataset of 35,000 school choice forms that parents must complete to enroll their child in elementary school. We combine this data with a newly compiled set of administrative data covering Berlin's several hundred elementary school enrollment zones for the years 2000 to 2018, which includes demographic and socioeconomic zone characteristics, student population indicators, and various school attributes and performance metrics. We explore in particular the extent to which we see Schelling sorting, where even weak preferences for separation from another group (and small changes in zone composition) can dynamically spiral to produce extreme patterns of segregation, and we develop policy implications for how to counteract such dynamics.","Keywords: migrant integration, school segregation, new data","Macartan Humphreys","Bernd Beber","RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research","Lennard Naumann","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Macartan Humphreys","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research","WZB Berlin Social Science Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This pattern has been well documented for men, women, individuals with higher formal education, and those with a migration background. However, how preferences for descriptive representation manifest among sexual and gender minorities remains unexplored. Likewise, the extent to which voters consider such identity-based characteristics when making electoral decisions is still insufficiently understood.This study addresses both issues using a novel dataset of 3,116 respondents. We examine how self-identification as male (N=1,655), female (N=1,461), LGB+ (N=286), or trans* (N=130) interacts with the perceived importance of gender and sexual identity, shaping preferences for representation by men, women, LGB+, or trans* individuals.Our analysis reveals notable gender-based differences. While men and women generally favor female representatives, with women expressing stronger preferences, women rate male representatives less favorably. Regarding LGB+ representation, heterosexual respondents who assign high importance to sexual identity in their voting decisions view sexual minority representatives less positively, while LGB+ respondents consistently express favorable evaluations. Similarly, trans* individuals rate trans* representatives significantly higher than non-trans* respondents, regardless of how important they consider gender and sexual identity.These findings underscore that sexual and gender minorities tend to view representatives from their own social group more positively, whereas non-minority group members often exhibit reluctance toward their inclusion. This asymmetry becomes particularly pronounced when non-minority voters attribute high significance to identity-based characteristics such as sexual orientation.","Keywords: LGBTQ*, sexual and gender minorities, gender, representation, descriptive representation","L.

Among these, empty signifiers —terms like democracy or justice that are widely used but lack fixed definitions— play a key role. This paper argues that Europe itself functions as an empty signifier contested by European political elites. Building on this premise, I analyse all the speeches delivered in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2023 by EU heads of government, heads of state, and European Commissioners, utilising Artificial Intelligence's Large Language Models (LLMs). In total, subdividing speeches in paragraphs, I analyse 45,379. Specifically, I employ ChatGPT —scholarly considered the leading AI tool in text analysis— to conduct two machine-learning-based classifications with human checks.First, I determine whether these speeches conceptualise Europe. I understand conceptualisation as either talking about how Europe should be –prescriptive, or describing what Europe is –descriptive. In the second step, I focus on the speeches that do conceptualise Europe, analysing how they frame it. Using the Comparative Manifesto Project's methodology combined with AI capabilities, I classify conceptualisations into four framings: cosmopolitan, ethno-cultural, economic, and cosmopolitan-communitarian. Each speech is scored on how well they fit to each framing based on word choice, tone (positivity/negativity), and context.Finally, descriptive analyses are conducted using datasets like the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), accounting for variables such as ideology, year of EU accession, or country of origin.

This paper examines the role of party ideology in local politics by analyzing party manifestos for local council elections.Local politics is frequently considered unideological compared to higher government levels; however, this study challenges that notion by analyzing ideological polarization and party influence through the lens of municipal council election manifestos. Drawing on a novel and still-growing dataset of over 350 local manifestos from Germany, I leverage text analysis techniques to scale and classify the political positions of local political parties. A key focus is on whether intracommunity variance (differences in ideology within a single municipality) outweighs intraparty variance (differences across municipalities within the same party), shedding light on the extent to which local politics is shaped by overarching party structures versus locally important policy issues. Although preliminary findings show a stronger focus on local issues than ideology in local manifestos, I still find pronounced ideological distinctions among parties, suggesting that local politics is more ideologically driven than often assumed.The paper contributes to the literature on political polarization and multi-level party organization. It further contributes to the quantitative text analysis literature as it requires scaling and comparing political texts with different qualities, lengths, and degrees of professionalism.

Using a candidate choice experiment fielded in probability-based surveys in France, Germany, Iceland, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden (N=17,010), we find that people select candidates matching their political views. However, voters with lower socioeconomic status select candidates with higher socioeconomic status more often than their beliefs about which candidate shares their preferences would indicate. We do not observe this bias among voters of higher socioeconomic status. A follow-up U.S. study (N=2000) corroborates the results.

"abstract_0420_1762_1509.html","Housing Wealth and Tax Preferences across Europe","Despite high and rising wealth inequality, taxes on the assets of wealthy citizens play a marginal role in many countries. Indeed, net wealth or inheritance taxes have been abolished or reduced in many countries in the recent past. While existing explanations for the decline of the taxation of assets focus on structural factors, we advance a complementary argument which highlights the micro-foundations of individuals' tax preferences. We argue that the lukewarm public opposition to tax cuts that only directly benefit the wealthy is aided by information asymmetries which prevent low-wealth individuals from formulating preferences that align with their material self-interest. As such, they effectively cede the political arena to the losers from asset taxation, who express well-informed preferences in line with their economic interests. Utilizing original survey data from Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, we find empirical support for our thesis. Housing wealth increases the likelihood of stating a preference, and homeowners and their children support less progressive taxation of wealth, inheritances, and capital gains. With rich data on housing wealth and three different taxes from seven European countries, we shed light on the neglected role of wealth in the formation of tax preferences, and our theoretical argument introduces insights from the literature on political representation to the study of the political economy of taxation.","Keywords: housing, wealth inequality, taxation, representation","Matthias Haslberger","Matthias Haslberger","University of St. Gallen","Mads Elkjaer","University of Copenhagen","Ben Ansell","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of St. Gallen","University of Copenhagen","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In between these vignettes, participants engage in everyday activities within the virtual state of Novaland, such as choosing between restaurants or park and adopting a dog or cat, allowing for a holistic immersion in the virtual state, higher attention and retention. We test pre-registered hypotheses of a social contract model between citizens and the welfare state. Our results show: (1) participants increased their willingness to pay for the welfare state when confronted with bad service delivery but significantly less so when confronted with a bad delivery in which they could bribe their way to a better service. (2) across different service experiences, participants showed lower levels of political trust for both low-quality and low-quality cum on-the-spot corruption experiences compared to high-quality experiences. This study underlines the crucial importance of effective social policies in maintaining political solidarity. In the post-COVID-19 period, many European states have struggled with a deterioration in service quality, making our findings particularly relevant.

"abstract_0422_0408_1006.html","Small men (GENBACK)","An increasingly large proportion of young men support parties that espouse sexist views towards women and challenge recent and hard-fought advances in gender equality. A frequent-cited explanation for this gender gap, particularly among the young, is grounded in men’s perceived relative deprivation vis-à-vis women: men who perceive greater threats to their former dominant status — e.g.  in labour markets — are often more inclined to question further gender equality measures or sympathise with far-right actors that advance illiberal views on gender. This paper builds on the framework of relative threat to investigate a less-explored dimension: threats to (fragile) masculinity. A popular assumption posits that men with fragile masculinity are more inclined to endorse misogynistic and sexist views. Does undermining one’s feeling of masculinity therefore change one’s views towards these issues?Using an original, pre-registered experimental design fielded among a well-powered sample of online survey respondents in Britain, we manipulate feelings of masculinity through provocative cues related to penis size. Taking the symbolic importance that men place on performative masculinity via the physical size of their ""manhood"" as an instrument to manipulate feelings of masculine dominance, we randomly expose men to information about their relative position among peers. We theorize that perceived threats to masculinity – primed via exposure to a significant over- or under-estimation of the population penis size mean – activate a psychological and emotionally negative response that can  engender heightened levels of benevolent sexism and an increased openness to far-right political actors who defend traditional gender hierarchies.","Keywords: experiment, far-right, gender gap, masculinity, threat","Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte","Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte","University of Southampton","Đorđe Milosav","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southampton","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With a mixed-methods approach, this study unpacks the interplay between “official” party rules and “real” party practices, advancing our understanding of intra-party determinants of women’s descriptive representation.By examining 227 political parties across 32 democracies, it provides robust, cross-national insights into how intra-party factors affect women’s candidacies and their campaign experiences. First, through a large-N analysis, the study reveals that inclusive candidate selection procedures, when paired with gender equality rules, significantly increase the share of women candidates. These effects are especially pronounced in parties with substantial female leadership and membership, highlighting the institutional levers that can advance gender parity in representation.Second, a case study of the 2023 Dutch local elections combines semi-structured interviews with women candidates from ten political parties and participant observation during electoral campaigns. Our novel data uncovers informal dynamics—such as entrenched gender norms and power asymmetries—that formal rules alone cannot address.

"abstract_0424_1406_1105.html","Exploring Citizen Engagement in the Governance of Regional Organisations","Theories of Multi-Level Governance (MLG) assert that power in modern governance is no longer limited to the nation-state but distributed vertically across levels, such as international Regional Organisations (ROs), and horizontally to include non-state actors like civil society. Public Administration research highlights that involving citizens in decision-making enhances transparency, accountability, and trust in institutions. As ROs take on central roles in addressing global challenges, understanding how they engage citizens is increasingly important. Yet, citizen participation mechanisms in ROs remain underexplored or limited to small-n studies. Recent studies reveal that only one-third of RO founding treaties reference citizen engagement, with considerable variation in the mechanisms developed. This raises a critical question: What conditions influence the development of citizen participation mechanisms in ROs?Building on theories of RO life-cycles, which call for closer examination of evolving institutional characteristics and performance, this study uses regression analysis to test different hypotheses drawn from literature on non-state actor involvement in governance. The analysis covers 70 ROs from 1945 to 2016. As a dependent variable, this paper develops a new Indicator of Citizen Participation in ROs (ICPRO), which measures access to information, elections, and consultations. Analysed alongside established indicators, such as the Measure of International Authority (MIA) and Legitimation Strategies of Regional Organisations (LegRO), preliminary findings reveal significant links between institutional power and participatory governance mechanisms. This research offers actionable insights for policymakers to enhance RO legitimacy and effectiveness through citizen engagement, offering a pathway for more inclusive governance.","Keywords: Citizen Participation, Regional Organisations, Multi-Level Governance","María Rodríguez Alcázar","María Rodríguez Alcázar","Ghent University; United Nations University Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies (UNU-CRIS)","Samuel Standaert","Ghent University; United Nations University Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies (UNU-CRIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ghent University","United Nations University Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies (UNU-CRIS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0425_1293_1358.html","Democratic Restoration and Its Tradeoffs: Evidence from Six Reversals of Democratic Backsliding","Reversals of democratic backsliding, while causes for celebration, have generated unique, new challenges for contemporary democracies, as seen in cases like Poland, Brazil, and the United States. A new problem has emerged in the wake of these “near miss” events, where electoral victories by opposition forces have halted institutional declines. The newly incumbent pro-democracy party or coalition must reverse the damage to institutional quality while simultaneously maintaining or increasing electoral support for democracy and pro-democracy political forces.To achieve this, pro-democracy parties or coalitions must balance the competing obligations to (1) make good on campaign promises to restore democratic institutions and (2) deliver on governance or policy commitments. This tradeoff is further compounded by a potential pressure to achieve democratic restoration through rule of law-abiding means.To understand this dilemma, we field the same survey experiment in six cases with mixed degrees of democratic backsliding and reversal: Poland, Brazil, the United States, India, Zambia, and Guatemala. Our series of vignette and conjoint experiments evaluates how voters weigh these competing obligations of democracy restoring parties at both the election and governing stage.  Our results point to a bind that parties who run on restoring democracy face: while voters may endorse a pro-democracy message, once these parties are elected, those same voters continue to prioritize their own policy interests. These results also reveal that for parties who want to remain both electorally popular and reverse democratic backsliding, it may be more strategic to restore democracy by non-rule of law-abiding means.","Keywords: democratic backsliding, democracy restoration, public opinion, survey experiments","Frances Cayton, Hanna Folsz","Frances Cayton","Cornell University","Hanna Folsz","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How Politicians (Shouldn’t) Present Themselves on X","What effects should politicians expect by employing a particular communicative behaviour? Are measures of sentiment and emotion complimentary or interchangeable in understanding the reception on social media? Much extant research implies particularly that – stemming from the theory of negativity bias – the use of negative sentiment should be an effective strategy. Diverging effectiveness in the use of negative language begs the question as to whether more nuanced measures such as emotion could provide a clearer picture. This study tests these theories implementing a micro-analysis of UK politicians’ Twitter/X communications (N=719,603). My findings reveal that, while neutral messages predominate, positive sentiments can resonate well with the public, contradicting established beliefs. The research, controlling for a range of fixed effects, reveals also a picture more nuanced than the frequently used sentiment-based approach. Language employing emotions like joy and disgust influence the popularity of tweets strongly whilst by no means always combining with positive and negative sentiment as expected respectively. Disgust leads to the highest approval and fear-based messages find least favour. Different implied emotions have varying impacts on sentiment, both in magnitude and polarity.Sentiment is a broader evaluative measure that is shaped by a combination of factors, including but not limited to emotion. This would motivate a new emphasis on treating sentiment and emotion as complementary but distinct components in social media analysis. It is, however, only with the quantification of emotion-types at scale that these results are revealed.","Keywords: emotion analysis, sentiment , Large Language Models, public policy","Janice Butler","Janice Butler",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute (EUI)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0428_2376_0138.html","Bureaucrats hired through connections are more dishonest and less pro-social: behavioral evidence from four countries","Numerous studies have linked bureaucratic politicization  – the appointment of bureaucrats based on political connections rather than merit – to greater corruption in government and worse public service delivery outcomes. Why does politicization have such effects? Prior studies have posited three main mechanisms. Politicization changes the incentives of bureaucrats, precludes socialization into an esprit de corps around public service, and selects less competent bureaucrats. We argue and provide evidence for a hitherto neglected mechanism: connection-based recruitment attracts and selects bureaucrats who are more dishonest and less pro-social. We test this argument with two behavioral games and original survey data from over 3,800 bureaucrats in Bangladesh, Ghana, Malawi, and Nepal. We find that bureaucrats who indicate that connections helped them get their jobs cheat more in honesty games and act less pro-socially in donation games. Our findings add an important empirical micro-foundation to studies of bureaucratic politicization and its behavioral implications inside government.","Keywords: Behavioral Games, Bureaucracy, Public Administration, Politicization, Dishonesty, Pro-Social","Virginia Oliveros","Jan Meyer-Sahling","University of Nottingham","Kim Saas Mikkelsen","Roskilde School of Governance","Virginia Oliveros","Tulane University","Christian Schuster","University College London","Brigitte Seim","University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","Rachel Sigman","University of Denver","","","","","","","","","University of Nottingham","Roskilde School of Governance","Tulane University","University College London","University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","University of Denver",NA,NA,NA,NA

We answer this question by analysing the impacts of Pakistan’s Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), one of the largest cash transfer programs targeted at women in the Global South. We use a regression discontinuity design to estimate program effects on women’s attitudes towards redistributive policies and public goods provision. In contrast to theories that posit that citizens in high-poverty settings will prefer more redistributive welfare programs, we find that program recipients of the BISP cash transfer actually reduce their preferences for redistribution. However, we find that this shift in preferences is not only driven by the income effect generated by the receipt of regular cash transfers from the state. Instead, we find that in households in which women’s agency is not challenged by senior household members, program recipients see greater utility of cash transfers in contrast to other forms of public good’s provision. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature that pays attention to how women’s intra-household status may influence their preferences for redistributive policies in developing democracies.","Keywords: Cash Transfers, Public Goods Provision, Gender, Redistributive Preferences, Social Policy, Regression Discontinuity Design.","Rehan Jamil","Rehan Jamil","London School of Economics and Political Science","Matteo Iudice","Economist, Amazon.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","Economist, Amazon.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0430_0977_0316.html","For Panel: FIRMAI: Working With or Against Firms: When are Welfare State Responses to Economic Modernization Effective?","Governments are increasingly trying to support modernization losers with labor market training but face the challenge that these social investment responses to technological change, globalization, and climate change often perpetuate economic (dis)advantage. Therefore, it is central to better understand the institutional determinants for effective social investment since most current initiatives, especially in coordinated market economies, face the dilemma of whether it is worth connecting them to existing (and eventually outdated) corporatist institutions or whether new policies with fewer institutional preconditions should be prioritized. We argue that social investment policies are especially effective when integrated into corporatist institutions. This is because firms are central intermediate actors shaping both people's experiences with economic modernization and the functioning of social investment policies. Consequently, it is decisive whether social investment policies coordinate firms around strategies that support vulnerable workers during structural change, which is a comparative advantage of corporatism. We test this argument by showing that the success (and failure) of one the world's most praised training schemes, the Danish AMU system, depends on its corporatist capacity to coordinate firm behavior, using full population register data linked to various social surveys. Ultimately, our paper provides a new perspective and unique quantitative evidence for the argument that corporatist economic institutions have a comparative advantage in achieving inclusive outcomes in periods of structural economic transformations.","Keywords: Technological change; Labor market policies; Corporatism; Varieties of Capitalism","Leon Küstermann","Leon Küstermann","European University Institute","Kees van Kersbergen","Aarhus Unversity","Francesco Colombo","Collegio Carlo Alberto","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","Aarhus Unversity","Collegio Carlo Alberto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0431_1437_0240.html","Unfair inequality and the role of circumstances: Two decades of inequality of opportunity in Colombia (2003-2023) (POLEI)","Not all inequalities are created equal. Inequality resulting from inherited circumstances is considered by many to be more objectionable than inequality due to individual choices and effort. Providing equal opportunities for success, irrespective of a person’s background, is an important goal for public policy. Furthermore, whether inequality is seen as morally justifiable influences people’s attitudes towards inequality, redistribution and other public policies. This paper examines inequality of opportunity (IOP) in Colombia over the last 20 years – separating inequality due to circumstances (“unfair” inequality) and effort (“justifiable” inequality). We analyse IOP across time periods and birth cohorts, testing the sensitivity of estimates to alternative survey weighting. We use the Colombian Living Standards Survey with sex, birth region, ethnicity and parental education as circumstances, and calculate equivalised household income and individual income for labour market participants. We estimate inequality in the distribution of incomes resulting from circumstances (ex-ante IOP) via the Gini coefficient using both traditional approaches and data driven methods (trees and random forests). Our results show that inequality due to circumstances accounts for between 50-60% of total inequality, with estimated IOP of 0.33-0.36 for household equivalised income. Both total inequality and IOP increase after the mid-2010s, while IOP is similar across birth cohorts. Overall trends are robust to corrections in survey stratification, however, outlier estimates (2010 and 2018) are sensitive, with original estimates showing considerable bias. This demonstrates the important of examining survey data particularly in a multi-year context, as IOP estimates can be sensitive to survey stratification.","Keywords: inequality, inequality of opportunity, Colombia, Latin America, fairness","Matthew Shaikh","Matthew Shaikh","Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)"," Sofia Gomez Tamayo","Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0432_1722_1229.html","Environmentalism as Long-Term Good Provision: Evidence from Forest Conservation","This article develops a novel institutional theory of long-term environmental good provision, particularly forest conservation. Long-term goods, or those for which payoffs are delayed or spread over time, are more likely to be provided by states with long-term institutions, or those with low discount rates and inter-temporal commitment mechanisms. Leveraging recent institutional theories, I argue that party institutionalization lengthens institutional time horizons while constraints on the executive allows inter-temporal commitment. Both features therefore predict long-term environmental good provision. Environmental goods are frequently long term because feedback from ecological systems creates tipping points or vicious cycles, meaning that current actions may be costless today but contribute to significant damage in future periods. Understanding the implications of the inter-temporal nature of many environmental goods is especially important because a large share of environmental goods, such as forest conservation, are not explained by traditional approaches which focus on public goods models for symmetric and non-excludable goods. I test my theory with cross-national time-series data on forest coverage, demonstrating that forest protection is not predicted by public goods theory but is well predicted by long-term institutions.","Keywords: time horizons, forest conservation","Sam Houskeeper","Sam Houskeeper",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Empirical research on wars and education rarely captures such effects, as they tend to focus on highly disruptive conflicts where violence reaches entire populations and the destruction of civil life overshadows any adaptive responses that can favour investing in human capital. To test our theory, we examine the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), a violent conflict that caused relatively limited disruption and did not specifically target educational infrastructure. We compare the educational attainment of individuals exposed to the war with that of cohorts from preceding and subsequent periods. Using a regression discontinuity approach, our results reveal that individuals who reached school age during the conflict exhibited higher completion rates for both primary and secondary education. The benefits were especially pronounced at the primary level for individuals from less-educated households. These findings support a new framework for exploring educational gains in conflicts that preserve civil structure, thereby allowing families to enhance children’s education. This framework is particularly relevant for studying contemporary, lower-intensity conflicts that, unlike total wars, may foster long-term educational benefits across generations.","Keywords: education, war, human capital, non-disruptive conflicts, Spain","Héctor Cebolla-Boado","Dulce Manzano","Institute of Policies and Public Goods, CSIC","Héctor Cebolla-Boado","Institute of Geography, Economics, and Demography, CSIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Policies and Public Goods, CSIC","Institute of Geography, Economics, and Demography, CSIC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent work emphasizes that exclusion is a direct outcome of competition and negotiation over authority. I offer an additional explanation: discrimination is brought on indirectly, where questions of loyalty and trust, brought up through civic conflict and contested authority, undermine the tenuous position of groups already marked as different. I study this mechanism at a key moment in political development, as fifteenth-century European polities experimented with representative institutions and constituents revolted against perceived untrustworthiness and misrepresentation. Using a sample of German cities where revolts did and did not occur, I give statistical and narrative evidence of how class-based conflict to “right-size” government spilled over into the persecution of Jews. Urban revolt shaped democratic development at the same time as spurring ethnoracial exclusion.","Keywords: political economy, representation, revolt, ethnic minorities, political development","Kerice Doten-Snitker","Kerice Doten-Snitker",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Santa Fe Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies on immigrant integration have struggled to determine the directional relationship between religiosity and integration, leaving it unclear whether religiosity influences integration or vice versa. This paper makes a novel contribution to the literature on immigrants’ integration by examining the complex relationship between integration, religiosity, and social capital. Empirically, the study utilizes panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and employs structural equation modelling alongside two-way fixed effects to disentangle these dynamics over time. The study found that a hostile local environment increases religiosity among refugees, potentially as a coping mechanism. Conversely, friendships within their origin communities are positively associated with friendships with Germans, suggesting that bonding social capital can facilitate bridging social capital. Furthermore, friendships with Germans are negatively related to religiosity, indicating that social integration may lead to secularisation, and positively related to employment, emphasizing their role in facilitating economic integration. These findings underscore the importance of the interconnectedness of social environments and interpersonal connections in shaping refugees’ integration processes.","Keywords: Integration, Religiosity, Social capital, Refugees","Naman Rawat","Naman Rawat",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stockholm University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0437_1084_1288.html","Beyond Neutrality: The Effect of Epistemic Diversity on Perceptions of Expert Legitimacy","Experts have become an important part of the policymaking pipeline in recent years. Most studies, however, assume technocratic governance derives its legitimacy from the development of rational or “objective” policy solutions. But as experts increasingly shape policy, we suggest their role encompasses a representative dimension as well. Hence, we ask: to what extent do citizens seek epistemic diversity in expert panels? We use a mixed-methods approach to answer this question. Focus Group Discussions conducted in the UK and Switzerland provide qualitative evidence that citizens desire both demographic (eg. social class, region) and professional (eg. vocation, types of experience) diversity among experts tasked with policymaking responsibilities. These preferences appear to stem from both intrinsic value judgements and instrumental lines of reasoning. To assess the extent to which such preferences for diversity translate to support for policy recommendations, we conduct a pre-registered vignette experiment in the aforementioned countries (N=3,200) that varies the diversity of an expert panel (descriptively diverse, professionally diverse, not diverse) and the desirability (desirable, not desirable) of the policy recommendation made by the panel. This paper makes a few key contributions. Unlike much existing research, our work suggests citizens evaluate experts as a group with political leanings. Further, while studies concerning the credibility of scientists stress the importance of perceptions of neutrality, our work suggests that citizens seek representation in experts: i.e. they value the perceived ability of experts to make policy recommendations that accommodate the lived experiences of citizens—for which diversity may function as a heuristic.","Keywords: Experts, representation, diversity, epistemic, legitimacy","Amber Zenklusen, Pradeep Krishnan","Amber Zenklusen","University of St. Gallen"," Pradeep Krishnan","University of St. Gallen"," Eri Bertsou","University of St. Gallen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of St. Gallen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0438_1813_0613.html","Income shocks in social networks and economic voting","This paper aims to advance our knowledge about how the personal economic situation impacts political preferences and vote choice. We do this by introducing the economic circumstances in an individual’s social ties as a parameter in the model of economic voting. We argue that previous research has had a too narrow view of personal economy, which may explain the weak and inconclusive results on pocket-book voting found in previous research. An individual is rarely entirely dependent on their income and is likely affected by sizeable or unanticipated changes in the personal finances of social ties. Theoretically, we build on the classic economic voting literature and the emerging literature on the impact of unanticipated economic shocks on political behavior (Alt et al., 2022; Grant et al., 2023; Margalit, 2019; Marten, 2019). We hypothesize that a sizeable negative income change or an unanticipated income shock from unemployment or sick leave within an individual’s social network should be associated with more pro-redistribution attitudes and an increased probability of voting for the left. To test this, we use a novel empirical approach combining high-quality survey panel data from the Swedish National Election Study 2018 and 2022 with administrative data over time from Statistics Sweden, including income-related information about the respondent and the respondent’s social ties. We measure negative income change and economic shocks from unemployment and sick leave among close and extended social ties based on kinship. We use three outcomes: vote choice, general attitudes toward redistribution, and specific attitudes toward social insurances.","Keywords: economic voting, pocket-book voting, economic shocks, voting behavior, political preferences","Maria Solevid, Moa Frödin Gruneau","Maria Solevid","Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg"," Moa Frödin Gruneau","Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the main elements consists of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and attributes the European Central Bank (ECB) the task of supervising the major European banks. How are executive actors, with a specific focus on the European Central Bank, held accountable to a democratically elected authority, while keeping independent from political interference? To address this question I investigate systematically the oversight relationship between the ECB and the European Parliament (EP) in the Banking Union and, specifically: a) how and why Members of the EP (MEPs) contest ECB supervisory decisions, and b) how and why the ECB is responsive to such parliamentary questions. Using an innovative dataset on ECB hearings before the EP in the period between 2013-2024, the paper employs, first, structural topic modelling to estimate the policy topics that most prominently feature in individual questions and, later, assesses disagreement based on the semantic distance between the policy positions articulated by the two institutions. The empirical analysis considers economic (such as bank scandals), and national factors (for example, MEPs’ party affiliation, public support, trust in the ECB, and size of the parliamentary committee) that might affect MEPs’ scrutiny and ECB’s answers.","Keywords: EU banking union, STM, European Central Bank, accountability","Camilla Mariotto","Camilla Mariotto",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Innsbruck",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extant work predicts that partisans who win elections are more likely to be satisfied with democracy than partisans who lose elections. Yet, little is known about how the strategic pre-electoral cooperation between political parties influence partisans’ democratic satisfaction. By leveraging the strategic cooperation of the center and left political parties against the far right in the second-round of 2024 French legislative elections, we argue that party signals of cooperation and democratic commitment at the district level attenuate the negative effects of losing elections on democratic satisfaction. By comparing across districts won by a leftist candidate, we expect centrist partisans to be more satisfied with democracy in districts in which the centrist candidate coordinated with the left against the far right than in districts in which the centrist candidate competed against the left and the far right. We find evidence to support our expectations using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy combined with individual panel data comparing centrist partisans in near-identical districts in which centrist candidates coordinated with the left against the far right with districts in which centrist candidates competed against the left and the far right in the second round.

Partisan responsiveness in post-industrial Europe","This paper examines biases in policy responsiveness in post-industrial Europe based on the political parties in government. Using a time-series cross-country analysis of 20 European countries from 1985 to 2018, with survey data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), the study explores how public opinion influences changes in policies in both economic (social spending) and cultural (trade, immigration, and environmental) dimensions. In the economic dimension, government responsiveness is shaped by a two-block structure, with left-wing governments responding to the preferences of lower-income groups, and right-wing governments aligning with higher-income groups. However, mainstream parties need the pressure of challenger parties in government to fully respond to the preferences of their constituents. In the cultural dimension, responsiveness follows a tripartite structure: (1) Left, (2) Centre-Right, and (3) Centre-Right with Radical Right governments. The Centre-Right alone tends to favour higher-income groups, while the inclusion of the Radical Right leads to policies that better reflect the preferences of lower-income groups, particularly on issues like immigration. The paper concludes that right-wing governments, especially those including Radical Right parties, respond to their constituencies on both dimensions, while left-wing governments respond only on economic issues, limiting their electoral success. This research highlights the significant role of partisan responsiveness in shaping policy outcomes in Europe.","Keywords: political representation, party responsiveness, party representation, Radical Right parties, party competition","Alberto López-Yagüe","Alberto López-Yagüe",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po Paris and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0442_2162_1353.html","Realist voters in democratic politics: motivated reasoning or rational trade-offs?","Existing research explains the breakdown of government accountability with voters’ low leves of information or by pointing to voters’ cognitive and partisan biases in perceptions of incumbent performance and responsibility attribution. This paper shows that existing work has overlooked an important third group of voters: those who rationally forgo accountability when they go to the polls. Unlike partisan motivated reasoners, these voters accurately perceive economic and performance indicators and accurately recognize the incumbent’s suboptimal performance. Nonetheless, they still choose to vote for the bad incumbent because they are aware of the representation-accountability trade-off that they face. Original survey experimental from three countries (United States, United Kingdom, Spain, N = 4200) confirms that a significant proportion of voters rationally forgo accountability and that more voters will do so in polarized contexts.

This paper examines public reactions to such apologies across domestic, recipient, and third-party audiences through an original U.S.-based survey experiment. Our findings challenge the prevalent perception that state apologies inherently involve trade-offs between international and domestic approval. Instead, we demonstrate that apologies for minor use-of-force incidents can simultaneously enhance domestic support for restraint and international approval, presenting a potential win-win scenario for leaders. At the same time, apologies present a distinct trade-off: while they enhance the origin country's international reputation, they also signal reduced resolve and capability.

"abstract_0444_0655_1511.html","IMF Programs and the Distributional Politics of Human Rights Repression","A long-standing research stream demonstrated with evidence at the national level that IMF programs are associated with more protests (Abouharb and Cingranelli 2009; Almeida and Pérez-Martin 2022; Haggard and Kaufman 1992; Ortiz and Béjar 2013) and human rights violations (Abouharb and Cingranelli 2007; Kentikelenis and Stubbs 2023). Recent work on the politics of implementation of IMF programs at the micro-level has demonstrated that governments allocate adjustment burdens strategically, using a logic of distributional politics, to protect their supporters while imposing adjustment costs upon opposition supporters, who then protest in response (Abouharb and Reinsberg 2023; Reinsberg and Abouharb 2024). A micro-level distributional politics approach can help us to understand who governments repress to maintain political control in the context of the protests associated with IMF programs. We argue that governments primarily target the political opposition—not their own partisan supporters—with repressive tactics. Our micro-level approach leads us to use large-N micro-level survey data from the Latinobarometro surveys, which asks people about their experience of IMF programs, political violence, and support for government and opposition parties. We find that opposition supporters are more likely to be the targets of government violence in the context of IMF reform programs than those who support the incumbent regime.","Keywords: International Monetary Fund, distributional politics, repression, human rights","Rod Abouharb","Rod Abouharb","University College London","Bernhard Reinsberg","University of Glasgow; University of Cambridge, Centre for Business Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University College London","University of Glasgow","University of Cambridge, Centre for Business Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study introduces a novel approach to visual sentiment analysis that directly addresses these perceptual differences in sentiment classification. In order to achieve this, we developed a dataset reflecting political divisions by curating images on a polarizing topic, annotated by individuals from distinct political affiliations. Using this dataset, we trained a deep learning multi-task, multi-class model to predict visual sentiment from different ideological viewpoints. By incorporating these diverse perspectives into the labeling and model training, our approach improves the accuracy of visual sentiment predictions and better mirrors human judgment. Ultimately, this study advocates for a paradigm shift in visual sentiment decoding, urging a move beyond traditional image-focused approaches to develop classifiers that more accurately capture the complexity of human sentiment.","Keywords: visual data, sentiment analysis, annotators bias, visual data labeling, deep learning","Olga Gasparyan, Elena Sirotkina","Olga Gasparyan","Florida State University","Elena Sirotkina","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Florida State University","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0446_0994_1007.html","GENBACK: Liberal value frames, gay rights and tolerance for the radical right","How do radical right-wing ideas become normalized? This study investigates in how far liberal value frames (e.g. framing an issue as protecting women’s rights or gay rights) lead to higher tolerance for Islam-critical positions. We test this by conducting a survey experiment where we vary whether an anti-Islam position is presented as a liberal value frame or not, and which party sends the message (mainstream/radical right). We also vary the gender of the message sender (male/female), and their sexual orientation (in a heterosexual/homosexual relationship). We expect that messages framed as a defense of liberal values lead to higher tolerance for Islam-critical positions. We also expect that congruence between the liberal value frame and the sender characteristics will strengthen the normalizing effect of the frame. By testing the effect of liberal value frames on anti-Islam sentiment, this study makes an important contribution to our understanding of how radical right-wing positions become normalized and accepted into the mainstream. At a time where we are witnessing a rise of radical right-wing parties and ideas across Europe, this study adds novel experimental evidence as to what the drivers underlying the normalisation of radical right-wing positions are.","Keywords: radical right; experiment; gender","Katharina Lawall","Katharina Lawall","University of Reading","Lise Bjanesoy","University of Bergen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Reading","University of Bergen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The underrepresentation of women persists despite being conducted with a closed-list proportional representation system associated with higher women representation in the literature. In this article, we shift the focus from electoral institutions to candidate selection to explain women’s underrepresentation. Using an original dataset of candidates in 7 elections (2002-2023) and over 15000 candidates, we study the impact of gender and various candidate qualifications on the rank position of candidates in party lists. Our preliminary findings show that women are less likely to get promising ranks in the party lists, controlling for their occupation and education as well as their legislative, party and local experience. While being a local candidate and having electoral experience increases the likelihood of getting promising ranks in general and this positive effect is higher for women candidates.","Keywords: Candidate selection, gender, political experience, political parties","Esra Issever Ekinci","Esra Issever Ekinci","Bilkent University","Ali Carkoglu","Koc University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bilkent University","Koc University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use pregnancy-related health problems like severe pain, chronic conditions, and mental health challenges to explore how health issues shape politics.We analyze data from the Swedish Pregnancy Panel, a longitudinal survey combined with medical records from the Swedish Pregnancy Register. Participants were surveyed from pregnancy week 22–24 up to two years postpartum. Health complications were identified via the registry using novel meta-codes assigned to individual diagnosis and procedure codes by healthcare staff. These meta-codes capture the seriousness, pain, and mental strain of the complications. We also match medical data with self-reported health status regarding, e.g., pelvic girdle pain.We hypothesize that health complications lead to shifts in political attitudes and participation. Specifically, we investigate whether women experiencing health problems show increased interest in welfare support and parental policies, and whether health complications heighten the salience of social welfare policies via a policy feedback loop. Support for abortion rights might be strengthened by experiencing serious medical complications. Finally, we retest the thesis that medical problems might dampen political participation, and when health problems have mobilization consequences.The findings from this study will contribute to understanding how specific health experiences influence political behavior, underscoring the importance of considering pregnant women's perspectives with health challenges in policymaking. By illuminating the political implications of pregnancy-related health complications, this research informs strategies to enhance political engagement among women facing pregnancy health issues, promoting inclusive governance.","Keywords: health effects, pregnancy, political behavior, political attitudes","Elias Markstedt","Elias Markstedt","University of Gothenburg","Dietlind Stolle","European University Institute; McGill University","Moa Frödin Gruneau","University of Gothenburg","Karolina Lindén","University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg","Verena Sengpiel","University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg","Elin Naurin","University of Gothenburg","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","European University Institute","McGill University","Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0449_1447_1360.html","When Do Voters Punish Corrupt Candidates? Evidence from Hungary","The question of how and when voters punish corrupt politicians remains central in political science. To understand why and under what conditions people may overlook or minimally punish corrupt politicians, recent survey studies have identified various mitigating factors. However, there remains limited insight into when different types of corruption are penalized, especially since survey experiments often fall short of explaining tolerance for corruption. Our paper offers a novel investigation into Hungary, deemed the most corrupt country in Europe by Transparency International. Using a conjoint survey experiment conducted shortly before the June 2024 elections, we analyze how voters assess and prioritize various candidate attributes, including corruption; the conditions under which they decide to punish or tolerate corruption; and their tolerance thresholds for corrupt behavior. Additionally, by leveraging the unique context of the June 2024 elections—when, for the first time, both EP and local elections were held on the same day—we test how the influence of mitigating factors in shaping voters’ reactions to corruption varies between local and EP elections. Preliminary findings reveal two key results. First, voters are more tolerant of corruption when the act is perceived as less severe, when it brings clear side benefits, or when the information comes from a non-credible source. Second, we show how voter reactions to corruption vary across electoral contexts: in local elections, corruption is punished more severely, whereas European elections elicit a weaker response to corruption, as they are perceived as less directly tied to local issues.","Keywords: Corruption, Public Opinion, Hungary, Survey experiment","Krisztina Szabó","Krisztina Szabó","RHUL","Ádám Reiff","HUN-REN CERS; CEU","Joost van Spanje","RHUL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RHUL","HUN-REN CERS","CEU",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0450_1177_0109.html","The Consequences of the Digital Governance of Online Public Spaces by Populist Leaders","This paper examines how populist leaders adopt policies that influence the governance of online public spaces, shaping their functionality, accessibility, and impact on public opinion. While previous studies have explored some of the economic and democratic outcomes of populist governments, they have largely overlooked how populists in power differ from their non-populist counterparts in shaping online public spaces. The study employs a two-stage methodology. First, it uses data from the Manifesto Project and the Global Party Survey to train a Large Language Model able to distinguish party manifestos based on populist versus non-populist, right-wing versus left-wing, and liberal versus illiberal characteristics. Second, it uses this classification along with data from V-Dem and Freedom on the Net (Freedom House) to test causal relationships between various forms of populism and three key outcomes: improving access to online public spaces, imposing content limits, and protecting or violating user rights. A difference-in-differences approach is applied to establish causality. The results indicate that left-wing populists do not significantly differ from their non-populist left-wing counterparts in promoting policies that improve access to online public spaces. However, there is a causal effect of illiberal populists—regardless of ideological orientation—on increasing content restrictions. Additionally, illiberal right-wing populists are uniquely associated with violations of user rights and more restrictive access policies. This study offers a nuanced understanding of how populist governance impacts the quality of online deliberation, which, in turn, has implications for the quality of democracy given its current critical role.","Keywords: Digital governance, populism, online public spaces","Juan Gomez Cruces","Juan Gomez Cruces",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hasso-Plattner Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0451_1476_0042.html","Trading-off Democracy: Left, Right, and Center","Healthy and stable democracies rely on the commitment of their most critical actors: the citizens. But are citizens fit to fulfill this role? The evidence is mixed. While citizens broadly support democratic principles in the abstract, they often vote for undemocratic candidates. This article advances the literature on democratic backsliding by exploring why citizens are willing to compromise on core democratic liberties. Drawing on a pre-registered candidate choice experiment conducted in 7 Latin American countries, we examine citizens’ commitment to democratic principles based on three factors: (i) their political orientation—left, center, or right, (ii) the type of policy at stake—whether economic, cultural, or valence issues, and (iii) different aspects of democracy, including electoral competitiveness, checks and balances, and civil liberties.Using both between- and within-individual variations, our findings reveal that citizens prioritize policies aligned with their ideological orientation: left-leaning individuals favor leftist policies, right-leaning individuals prioritize rightist policies, and centrists focus on centrist policies. Furthermore, citizens priorities different types of policies, left-leaning citizens emphasize economic issues, while right-leaning citizens focus on cultural and social issues such as law and order. This article makes three contributions. First, it demonstrates that the tension between abstract support for democratic norms and their practical application extends beyond the U.S. Second, it highlights that individuals trade off democratic principles for different reasons, driven by the varying salience of specific issues across ideological groups. Third, it provides insights into which aspects of democracy individuals are more likely to condone in pursuit of ideological goals.","Keywords: democracy, backsliding, tolerance, Latin America, experiment","Alberto Stefanelli","Alberto Stefanelli","Yale"," Milan Svolik","Yale","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although 195 countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Accord, countries vary considerably in their domestic mitigation and adaptation policies. While existing explanations of collective action and distributive concerns well highlight the challenges in climate change cooperation, they fall short in systematically identifying the source of governments’ preferences across countries. Using text analysis of over 2300 climate policies of 86 countries, I show that countries’ economic competitiveness in the clean energy transition explains their willingness to accelerate or decelerate the transition through their climate policies. A country with a large manufacturing sector, which heavily uses fossil fuel and would incur large transition costs, is less likely to adopt any climate policies, and when it does, it proposes fewer policies related to clean energy, such as renewable energy and decarbonization. On the other hand, countries without large manufacturing sectors have more comprehensive mitigation and adaptation policies across sectors. Understanding why countries lead (or lag) in efforts to combat climate change can help answer a source of collective action problem in international environmental cooperation.","Keywords: climate change, energy transition, manufacturing, interest groups","Clara Park","Clara Park",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Duke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

National symbols can serve as important instruments for cultivating a sense of national identity and cohesion, particularly in contexts where such unity is threatened. This paper investigates the determinants of non-compliance with the display of national flags in Catalonia, a Spanish region where pro-secession sentiment has grown over time. We use original data from photographs of approximately one thousand Catalan town hall facades from 2021 to 2024, where the Spanish flag should be visibly displayed as required by law but is absent in many municipalities. We exploit this variation to examine how factors such as ethnic outbidding, the state’s capacity to enforce laws, social pressure, and local politicians’ career incentives affect the display of the Spanish flag in town halls. Employing a combination of regression discontinuity designs, difference-in-differences models, and cross-sectional analysis, we estimate the impact of these factors on the likelihood of flag display. Our findings reveal that while the presence of central elites plays a key role in promoting national symbols, other factors—including competition among pro-secession parties, local social pressures, and politicians’ career incentives—also significantly influence the extent of non-compliance. This study sheds light on the various factors influencing states’ capacity to use national symbols to foster nation-building in peripheral regions experiencing secessionist challenges.","Keywords: State capacity, National symbols, National identity, Secessionist movements","Isobel Kemp, Albert Falco-Gimeno","Isobel Kemp","University of Barcelona"," Albert Falco-Gimeno","University of Barcelona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" and Farage's Brexit slogan, ""Take back control,"" referred to the past. Although invoking nostalgia has long been an important element of political strategy, empirical studies examining the extent of nostalgia focus on party manifestos and defining nostalgia as a reference to the past (Müller, 2022; Müller & Proksch, 2024). In this study, we extend this work to a new dataset: parliamentary speeches. In our work, we ask (1) to what extent is nostalgic rhetoric expressed in UK parliamentary speeches between 2009 and 2019 and (2) how the extent of expressed nostalgic rhetoric varies. We used a pre-trained nostalgic detection model trained on political party manifestos (Müller & Proksch, 2024) to detect the nostalgic expression in UK parliamentary speeches. We found that nostalgic rhetoric is only used 1.15% of the time, especially when discussing culture, and by smaller political parties, with the Respect party using nostalgic rhetoric the most on average, with 4.70% of their speeches containing nostalgic rhetoric, followed by APNI (3.12%), and UUP (1.97%). Consistent with previous research, we find culture to be the most prominent topic with nostalgic rhetoric usage (Müller & Proksch, 2024). However, contradictory to previous research (Müller & Proksch, 2024), we do not find culturally conservative parties to use the most nostalgic rhetoric. While nostalgia might play a role in political party manifestos as a political strategy, its role in parliamentary speeches is rare and topic-specific.","Keywords: nostalgia, parliamentary speeches, UK, LLM","Pietro Michael Lepidi, Mária Žuffová","Anna Rae George","Oxford University Institute","Pietro Michael Lepidi","University of Bologna","Mária Žuffová","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Institute","University of Bologna","European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0455_2309_1289.html","Authoritarian legacy or economic necessity? Investigating the contextual determinants of public support for non-democratic models of government","While public opinion surveys indicate that the vast majority of citizens around the world are in favour of “a democratic political system”, recent evidence suggests that non-democratic alternatives are increasingly popular. Citizens in established democracies voted for leaders who openly subverted democratic norms, such as Trump, Orban, Bolsonaro and Modi (Graham and Svolik, 2020). And a growing share of citizens express support for being governed by “a strong leader who bends the rules to get things done” (Foa and Munk, 2017). Through a latent profile analysis of data from a Pew Research Centre survey conducted in 38 countries, we show that while very few people reject democratic models of government (e.g., representative or direct democracy) just under 70% of citizens, whom we refer to as either “shy” or “hybrid” democrats, support non-democratic models (e.g., autocracy or military junta) alongside democratic ones. We also test two competing country-level explanations for these preferences. The first is that they are part of a country’s authoritarian legacy. The second, inspired by the example of the Asian Tigers, is that economic growth contributes to the perception that strong leaders are more capable of ensuring prosperity. Our results show that shy or hybrid democrats are indeed more prevalent in countries with a longer history of dictatorship (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Spain, Lebanon, South Africa, Tanzania, India, Russia and Vietnam) and in countries that experienced economic growth in the five years preceding the survey (e.g., Turkey, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, India, Philippines and Vietnam).","Keywords: public opinion, democratic support, autocratic preferences, comparative politics","Sebastien Rojon","Sebastien Rojon","Université libre de Bruxelles","Jean-Benoit Pilet","Université libre de Bruxelles","Paulina Pankowska","Universiteit Utrecht","Davide Vittori","Université libre de Bruxelles","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université libre de Bruxelles","Universiteit Utrecht",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An independent Scotland would have faced a range of potential monetary and currency options, including retention of the status quo, establishing a separate currency or joining the euro. Using data from a two-wave nationally representative survey we designed and conducted three months before and three months after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum  we examine three different types of evidence to explore how beliefs and preferences over currency impacted referendum preferences: belief and knowledge questions about likelihood of retention of status quo; retrospective questions on key factors influencing vote; and survey experiments offering different currency scenarios. Across all three types of evidence, we find that currency and monetary factors had a high degree of influence on voting intention and vote choice.  The data highlight the ways in which economic calculations structure constitutional preferences and in so doing show how state formation can be influenced by voter understandings of risk and uncertainty, specifically about currency.","Keywords: referendums, voter behaviour, risk, uncertainty, currency","Ailsa Henderson","Ailsa Henderson","University of Edinburgh","Liam Delaney","London School of Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Edinburgh","London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0457_2332_0803.html","Local Ties and Electoral Success: Recruitment Strategies of New Political Parties in Germany","New political parties face considerable challenges upon their emergence: they must simultaneously mobilize voters and recruit candidates, all without the established mechanisms—such as party brands, retrospective voting, or party loyalty—that connect voters to mainstream parties. In this context, recruiting high-quality candidates becomes crucial, as these individuals serve as the party’s representatives within their local communities (Favero & Zulianello, 2023; Horne, 2022). While previous research identifies education as a key indicator of candidate quality (Art, 2011; Loxbo & Bolin, 2016), I argue that new parties lacking access to highly educated recruits can still effectively mobilize voters by prioritizing candidates with strong local ties. To test this hypothesis, I examine the case of Germany, comparing two successful new parties (the Greens and the AfD) with two less successful ones (the ÖDP and the Republicans). Using unique data on the birthplaces and places of residence of all candidates in federal elections from 1980 to 2021, as well as data on over 200,000 local candidates from the 1980s and 2010s, I link candidate characteristics to their personalized votes.

"abstract_0458_1424_1569.html","Are Working-Class Candidates Less Likely to Win Elections?","Working-class Americans are significantly underrepresented in politics. Some argue that they are filtered out during elections. Others argue that barriers to entry, not the elections themselves, keep them out of office. Are working-class candidates less likely to win elections?  This question is difficult to answer because we typically only have the occupational history of candidates who win elections. To overcome this limitation, we collect the full occupation history available on campaign websites for all 8,019 candidates who finished first or second in a congressional primary between 2010 and 2022. Using both difference-in-differences and primary regression discontinuity research designs, we find that when a party nominates a working-class candidate, that candidate is no less-likely to lose their election than non-working-class candidates. This is not because individual candidate characteristics don’t matter in elections, or that working-class candidates aren’t different from other candidates in important ways. Instead, we find that working-class candidates perform as well as other candidates despite having fewer positive valence characteristics, (e.g. ivy league education, a graduate degree or previous political experience), receiving a smaller share of general election donations, and being more ideologically extreme. Taken together, these results provide evidence that general elections do not contribute to the underrepresentation of working-class Americans in government.","Keywords: Class, Elections, Representation, Political Inequality","Fred DeVeaux","Fred DeVeaux","University of California, Los Angeles","Jared Abbott","California State University, Los Angeles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Los Angeles","California State University, Los Angeles",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0459_2200_1355.html","Democratic Recession and the Winner-Loser Gap in Evaluations of Democracy","A key feature of democratic backsliding is its contestedness, with experts and citizens often disagreeing over the quality of democracy in a specific country. This is a challenge, as domestic and international responses to backsliding depend on citizens' accurate assessment of the situation. Nevertheless, we have a limited understanding of the nature of and variation within citizens' perceptions of political regimes in contexts of democratic backsliding. The manuscript bridges research on citizens' support for undemocratic leaders, which mostly uses experimental approaches, with survey-based work on the determinants of political evaluations, focusing on the gap in perceptions between government and opposition supporters.Using detailed evaluations of democratic quality from the European Social Survey (ESS), cross-sectional data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), and original survey data on perceptions of backsliding, the paper highlights a larger gap in perceptions of democratic quality in contexts currently experiencing democratic backsliding and maps its size across different aspects of democracy. This goes beyond the impact of democratic quality studied in previous research.The manuscript advances three potential explanations for these diverging perceptions. First, citizens' evaluations rely on benchmarking, emphasizing relative change rather than static quality. Second, the stakes of elections and governance rise in contexts of backsliding, making evaluations more polarized. Third, motivated reasoning plays a key role as backsliding alters the availability and framing of accurate performance information. These findings underscore how backsliding widens partisan divides, complicating consensus on democratic norms and reducing citizens' ability to recognize and respond to democratic erosion.","Keywords: democratic backsliding, citizen attitudes, evaluations of democracy","Theresa Gessler","Theresa Gessler",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is reflected in the language used by speakers and the emotions expressed in their speech delivery. Scholars interested in international assemblies have not yet, however, taken full advantage of video recordings to systematically study debates from this perspective. This study draws on quantitative text analysis methods and recent developments in automated emotion recognition to analyze the content and delivery of speeches in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Given that international debates on human rights norms are highly emotionally charged, this is a promising context for studying emotions in international assemblies. Initial results suggest that emotions come more to the forefront in debates on proximate topics and are especially detectable for speakers with direct stakes in the debated topic. Thus, we contribute to our understanding of the role of emotions in international assemblies and shed light on variation in the type and intensity of expressed emotions across topics and countries. We also propose a framework for how these vast quantities of video data can be automatically processed in the future. Moreover, the study provides novel insights into the degree of international polarization of different human rights norms, which leaves observable traces in delivery of speeches in the UNHRC.","Keywords: international polarization","Simon Hug","Simon Hug",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Geneva",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While previous research has categorized YouTube channels by their political ideologies, there has been limited deep analysis of the actual content produced by these channels. Specifically, there is a limited understanding of how creators in these ideological groups frame their videos over time, and how this framing shapes the ideologies they present. Since video is the primary communication medium on YouTube, a detailed examination of video content is essential to fully comprehend the conveyed messages. To tackle these gaps, we develop a dataset of YouTube video transcripts, organized according to 14 political ideological groups (e.g. White Identitarian, Partisan Left, etc.) from different channels. We created a dataset with around 3 million video metadata entries (e.g., title and description) and selected a representative sample of around 10,000 videos for a more in-depth analysis. Using OpenAI's Whisper model, we transcribed these videos and captured screenshots to examine visual settings. We then employ TopicGPT to analyze the main and sub-frames used by different creators and ideologies over time. Additionally, we create a video description automatically derived from the frames captured in the screenshots. This multimodal approach, combining voice, image, and text analysis through Large Language Models, provides deeper insights than simpler methods that rely solely on title analysis or channel categorization. Our research offers new perspectives on how ideological influences shape YouTube content and how this can be analyzed on a large scale with multimodal models.","Keywords: ideological framing, YouTube, multimodal, large language models","Christopher Klamm","Christopher Klamm","University of Mannheim"," Ignatius Bernandi Jordi Harsawiguna","University of Mannheim"," Simone Ponzetto","University of Mannheim","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When exposed to data highlighting commitment gaps between heterosexual men and women, and even larger disparities among gay/bisexual men and women, respondents display decreased warmth toward sexual minorities and shift towards conservative education policy preferences. Support for traditional Christian family education increases while backing for progressive curricula—covering LGBT+ issues, sexual consent, and relationship diversity— declines. I show how these effects can be most pronounced among conservative voters and, among women, who despite their generally progressive attitudes show the strongest conservative shifts when confronted with evidence of sexual permissiveness.","Keywords: dating, backlash, LGBTQ+ rights, far-right","Alberto López Ortega","Alberto López Ortega",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Harvard UniversityVU Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While past research focused on healthcare budgets, recent studies highlight the importance of institutional context, power dynamics, and governance. E.g., it has been shown that higher female political representation can correlate with better reproductive health outcomes.Aim: This study explores: (i) How do institutional, administrative, political, and social context affect health system performance? (ii) Is there a link between administrative tradition and health outcomes? (iii) Does female political representation’s impact on public health vary by administrative tradition?Methods: Health system performance is assessed using a set of UN Sustainable Development Goals indicators (2000-2020, 167 countries). Explanatory variables include health expenditure, social health insurance coverage, healthcare workforce (WHO, World Bank), legal origin, administrative tradition (LaPorta et al., 1999; Bianculli et al., 2013), democracy, female parliamentary representation (V-Dem), state capacity, ideology, populism, social trust (World Values Survey), and GDP per capita. Data analysis is performed via random effects and two-way fixed effects panel data estimation.Key Results: Health system performance appears to be significantly influenced by administrative tradition. Countries with interventionist administrative traditions (e.g., Socialist, French, Germanic, Scandinavian) tend to achieve better outcomes than those with British tradition.

"abstract_0465_0319_0046.html","Activating the Environmental Norms: The Effect of Electing a Female Candidate on Agricultural Practices of Farmers","Climate change has posed serious challenges to society. In order to tackle with these challenges, governments have implemented various environmental policies. However, prior studies suggest that these environmental policies rather cause public backlash, even though their success largely rests on voters' support and cooperation for environmental protection. How can public support and pro-environmental behavior of voters be promoted? In this study, I argue that electing a female mayor contributes to the activation of the environmental norms and the promotion of pro-environmental behavior. Using data on organic farming in France and a close-election regression discontinuity design, this study shows that electing a female mayor promotes environmentally friendly agricultural practices of farmers, a social group which incurs unequal costs for environmental protection. The result reveals that the electoral victory of a female mayor increases a proportion of agricultural fields dedicated to organic farming in a municipality. This study also demonstrates that the positive effect of a female mayor is pervasive even outside of agricultural fields: the establishment of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Additionally, this study shows that farmers' transition to organic farming is not driven by their economic interests and by initiatives led by a local authority. This study implies that local political changes, like municipal elections, are sufficient for the activation of the environmental norms and the promotion of pro-environmental behavior of voters.","Keywords: Environmental politics; Gender; Political Behavior","Hikaru Nukui","Hikaru Nukui",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Waseda University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0466_0669_0115.html","Which conflicts does the populist radical right represent? A Western Europe comparison","From a cleavage theory perspective, the rise of populist radical right parties (PRRPs) is often attributed to their ability to politicize specific social conflicts. However, the nature of these conflicts remains a subject of debate. Some scholars emphasize PRRPs’ appeal to the cultural losers of globalization, framing them as one pole of a globalization-related cultural cleavage. Others highlight their support base among economically insecure individuals or the working class. PRRPs have also been associated with peripheral-rural interests due to their strength outside urban centers. This paper revitalizes the literature at the intersection of cleavage politics and the populist right with original survey data from seven Western European countries: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. We examine which conflicts PRRPs represent and whether this varies by context. Drawing on ‘traditional’ and ‘neo’ cleavage theory, we analyze eight societal conflicts. In addition to the traditional cleavages described by Lipset and Rokkan, we examine conflicts between skilled and unskilled workers, ethnonationalism and cosmopolitanism, traditionalism and LGBTQ+ rights, and economic growth and environmental sustainability. With specific items, we assess how individuals’ positions on these conflicts, the salience they assign to them, and their self-identification with others on the same conflict side predict voting for PRRPs. Our findings show that PRRPs most strongly represent conflicts rooted in ethnonationalism, traditionalism, and environmental issues. Conversely, their alignment with rural interests and economic or labor-related conflicts is weaker. Finally, country-level variations underscore the role of national contexts in shaping PRRPs’ resonance with specific conflicts.","Keywords: Western Europe, Cleavages, Populist Radical Right","Mirko Crulli","Mirko Crulli","Luiss University","Gianluca Piccolino","University of Florence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Luiss University","University of Florence",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I examine caste-specific police stations in India, i.e., those staffed by and that cater solely to a minority. The goal—whereby Scheduled Caste/Tribe complainants file cases against out-groups—is to empower and bring justice to the marginalized. Using an original individual-level dataset of roughly half a million cases from 2017-2022 in a region where the institutions were expanded, I conduct difference-in-difference analyses to estimate the bodies’ impact, and draw on machine learning applied to citizen testimonies as well as ethnography. To probe final outcomes, I analyze 1.3 million judicial rulings. Marginalized groups can face hate-crime, including sexual violence perpetrated against minority women by out-groups. Creating “enclave” modes of representation in law enforcement for disadvantaged castes increases the state’s cognizance of hate-crime and complaints are, in turn, tackled by senior, co-ethnic oﬀicers. Nevertheless, enclaves or specialized police stations are not associated with substantive change for victims that follow-through with the multi- stage process of seeking perpetrator punishment. Identity-based segregation might offer some benefits for complainants at specific stages of seeking restitution, but falls short of meaningfully altering the final justice that they receive.","Keywords: Crime, Justice, Judiciary, Representation, Sexual Assault, Caste, Gender","Nirvikar Jassal","Nirvikar Jassal",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0468_0024_0200.html","Outgroup Evasion and Attitudes Towards Taxation","The provision of public goods is commonly viewed as more challenging in diverse societies because people are believed to be less willing to pay taxes to finance a public sector that benefits other groups, thus leading to lower tax morale. In this study, we investigate the idea that this negative association may result from individuals' reluctance to bear the economic cost for other groups when they think these groups do not contribute their fair share. We conduct a survey experiment in Turkey to assess whether people react more strongly to anecdotal reports of tax evasion by members of an outgroup rather than an ingroup. Additionally, we examine whether majority group's attitudes are more sensitive to tax evasion by minority group members than the reverse scenario. Our findings reveal no significant influence of the outgroup or minority status of the tax evader on the tax attitudes of respondents. However, we observe that individuals' tax morale drops significantly when exposed to reports of evasion among ingroups. This suggests that the negative association between diversity and tax revenues may not stem primarily from inter-group dynamics, such as a direct negative reaction to the behavior of minority groups. Instead, the results highlight the importance of intra-group norms, where individuals' tax morale is more susceptible to erosion due to the perceived non-compliance of their own group members.","Keywords: Tax morale, survey experiment, political economy, tax compliance","Yusuf Magiya","Yusuf Magiya","NYU Abu Dhabi"," Giuliana Pardelli","NYU Abu Dhabi","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"NYU Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0470_0734_0234.html","The Dual Role of Subsidies: Balancing Foreign Security Concerns and Intra-EU Competition","To what extent do subsidies reflect not only external protectionism but also geopolitical and market power strategies within the European Union (EU)? Subsidies for import-competing industries have become a prominent policy tool among advanced economies, including the EU, where they are often framed as mechanisms to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. However, we argue that member states strategically use subsidies to bolster their market power within the EU’s single market. We hypothesize that subsidies are frequently allocated to specific firms rather than entire industries. Bypassing collective action problems to lobby for traditional protectionism (Kim, 2017), we expect struggling firms who are market leaders to exploit this and seek protection, especially from the national governments, via subsidies. Economic concentration and electoral institutions in relatively homogeneous sectors lead to collective subsidies (Rickard, 2018). We test whether security concerns play a significant role, with governments more likely to subsidize firms disadvantaged by foreign competition, especially in strategic sectors. We analyze subsidy disbursement patterns among EU member states using the Global Trade Alert dataset on corporate subsidies and firm-level financial data, connecting firms, sectors, and products. Our findings reveal that subsidies impact non-EU competitors, such as China, and intra-EU competition, challenging the notion of a unified European market. Moreover, nearly half of these subsidies are firm-specific, confirming the expected driving role of firms. These results contribute to the literature on the geopolitics of trade and the dual role of EU subsidies in addressing external threats while recalibrating internal power dynamics.","Keywords: EU, subsidies, geopolitics, security, competition","Alessia Invernizzi, Ryan Pike","Alessia Invernizzi","ETH Zurich","Ryan Pike","Yale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","Yale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0471_0314_1154.html","Breaking the mold or fitting the frame? The impact of politician’s gender-conforming and counter-stereotypic online self-representation on voter evaluations.","This study investigates how gendered communication strategies in political self-representation influence voter perceptions, drawing on role incongruity theory and the double bind dilemma. Specifically, we explore (1) how self-representation strategies on social media — emphasizing communal or agentic traits — affect voter evaluations of competence, likability, and voting intentions, and (2) whether these effects differ by candidate gender and policy issue. A pre-registered online 2x2x2 between-subjects survey experiment, with a power-determined sample (N=3400), examined voter reactions to pre-tested AI-generated Twitter/X timelines of fictional candidates exhibiting communal or agentic traits through visuals. Hypotheses include that female politicians displaying agentic traits will be rated higher on competence but lower on likability, while male politicians exhibiting communal traits will score higher on likability but lower on competence. Furthermore, we hypothesize that counter-stereotypic strategies will have distinct impacts based on candidate gender, and these effects will vary between hard-policy (defense) and soft-policy (welfare) topics. This study addresses methodological gaps by emphasizing visual cues, which are critical for trait inferences yet often neglected in text-based analyses. Prior research suggests voters rely on visual information as primary indicators of gender, implying that previous text-focused findings may underestimate these effects (Coronel et al., 2021). This may clarify the current conflicting evidence regarding stereotype incongruity in candidate evaluations and its electoral consequences for women in politics (Rohrbach et al., 2022). In doing so, our findings contribute to broader discussions on gender and political leadership, examining whether the increased visibility of women in political leadership has shifted voter stereotypes.","Keywords: social media, gender, experiment, role incongruity theory, voter perception","Elise Storme","Elise Storme","Ghent University","Robin Devroe","Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel","Bram Wauters","Ghent University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ghent University","Vrije Universiteit Brussel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0472_1138_0348.html","Reactionary Bureaucrats, Political Violence and Democratic Erosion in Weimar Germany","A distinctive feature of the first German transition to democracy after World War I was the paucity of meaningful democratizing reform of the sprawling federal, state, and local bureaucracies. In this paper, I argue that insufficient efforts to reform a deeply anti-democratic state apparatus prevented the consolidation of democratic governance in the Interwar period. Focusing on the state of Prussia and the 1917-1932 period, I build a county-level panel combining original career data on local law enforcement officials, novel biographical data on the universe of candidates for elected office and secondary data on incidents of politically motivated violence and electoral outcomes. Leveraging a difference-in-differences design, I demonstrate that replacement of reactionary law enforcement officials by outsider candidates vetted by the democratic central government (i) led to a reduction in the incidence of politically motivated violence, (ii) reduced the number of Nazi candidates running for office, and (iii) increased electoral support for pro-democratic parties at the expense of the Nazi party. My paper identifies the persistence of autocratic bureaucracies as a crucial obstacle to democratic consolidation and efforts to limit political violence.","Keywords: Democratization, Political Violence, Bureaucracy, Policing, Historical Political Economy","Moritz Bondeli","Moritz Bondeli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale UniversityHumboldt Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines how perceived threats from internal French migration influenced support for both independence and political violence in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia, ultimately leading to widespread unrest there in May 2024. Through a survey experiment with 1,200 indigenous respondents, the research analyzed how different framings of migration patterns affected indigenous Kanak attitudes toward separatism and contentious action. The findings reveal that fears of demographic displacement from internal French migrants significantly increased support for independence and political violence, particularly among younger Kanaks. These results demonstrated how nativist sentiments can drive left-wing decolonization movements, despite typical associations of nativism with right-wing politics in Western contexts. This apparent paradox highlights how similar psychological mechanisms of demographic threat can fuel both anti-immigrant politics in Western metropoles and indigenous resistance in colonial settings. The research exposes the shared psychological roots of nativism and indigenous decolonial politics, challenging the conventional opposition between these movements and suggesting both spring from similar anxieties about demographic marginalization.","Keywords: nativism, decolonization, political violence, France","Lachlan McNamee","Lachlan McNamee",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Monash University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Do election results affect how the public perceives public security? We leverage the timing of opinion surveys in Chile about public security to show that respondents have different perceptions about their safety before and after local elections. Results show that shortly after a local right-wing candidate wins by a small margin, respondents declare that their neighborhood, state, and country are less safe than those who answered the same survey a few days before the election. This creates a crime perception gap relative to victimization, which does not vary among groups of respondents. These results are robust to several checks, such as margin of victory, political power turnovers, and pre-trends.

"abstract_0477_0531_1236.html","How does working from home impact political participation?","The rise of remote working has transformed traditional labour arrangements. This paper examines how working from home (WFH) influences political participation by testing two competing theoretical frameworks: the resources model of political participation and the political socialisation theory. On the one hand, WFH increases free time for civic engagement by reducing commuting to work. On the other hand, WFH diminishes the workplace’s role as a socialization hub, weakening occupational identities and workplace interactions crucial for collective political participation. This paper tests these competing theories using UK panel data spanning from 2009 to 2023. The findings indicate that WFH increases less costly forms of political participation, such as voting. However, it simultaneously reduces participation dependent on workplace interactions, such as party or trade union affiliation. These findings highlight the broader political implications of workplace technological transformations.

"abstract_0480_0202_0882.html","Superpower Investment in the Developing World – comparing China and The US investment behaviour in Indonesia and Kenya","This article raises an important question about the growing multipolarity of global power. China has become a challenger for the US’ status as the predominant world investor. China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) is a profound illustration of how China has risen as an alternative for developing countries seeking financial aid. China, gradually, is replacing the United States as the most influential investor in many developing countries. Indonesia and Kenya are two countries that have benefited from the BRI. How can we make sense of this changing trend? What explains a country’s decision to consider China as a potential alternative for US funding?This article contends that China’s investment behaviours are preferable to the US’s, particularly in energy-related sectors. Institutional veto players in Indonesia and Kenya work differently for Chinese and US investors because China and the US require different conditions for investments. The US’s investments often involve tedious, complex conditions that require political and institutional adjustments. This paper argues China’s investment strategy is changing our preconceived understanding of international norms and foreign investment practices. The argument is developed using primary and secondary data collected through interviews and document analysis of the government’s official publication, including the investment agreements. The findings of this study aim to contribute to the issue of linkages between the domestic and international political economy of foreign investment. This paper highlights the need to marry two levels of analysis to better understand the interconnected world and how domestic governance fits into this era of growing multipolarity.","Keywords: Foreign Investments, China and the US, Developing Countries, International Political Economy, Institutional Veto Players","Kaitlin Common, Cahyani Widi Larasakti","Kaitlin Common","University of Melbourne"," Cahyani Widi Larasakti","University of Melbourne","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Melbourne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has found that, even in context of generally high levels of hostility against refugees, there is some evidence that certain kinds of refugees are preferred by the public, with a clear favoritism towards those that have suffered from distress and violence, percieved as being ‘genuine’ refugees. However, the study of the effect of different ‘push’ factors on attitudes towards migrants remains underdeveloped. The descriptions of the push factors are often abstract, highly politicised labels, such as ‘forced’ or ‘voluntary’ migration, or ‘economic’ migrants or ‘asylum seekers’. We argue that these pre-set categories mask important variation in how the public thinks about causes of fleeing for people on the move.We propose a novel survey experimental setup fielded in the UK, in which we explore how the public views the relative weight of causes to move away in light of violence, poverty, disaster and climate change from context-specific scenarios. Survey respondents are presented with two vignettes, each presenting a short and realistic scenario of why a person decided to flee, and asked to choose which one they consider having a better reason for fleeing. One feature of this proposed experiment, and in contrast to the more classical conjoint in a tabular form, is our choice to focus on realistic scenarios and individual stories.

"abstract_0482_0822_1367.html","Environmental protests and public opinion in electoral autocracies. Evidence from Russia.","Can climate change upend politics in authoritarian settings? We analyse protests over environmental degradation as an overlooked threat to authoritarian rulers. We propose that protests over worsening environmental conditions have the potential to bolster dissatisfaction toward the authorities in ways that protests advancing political grievances are unable to do. To some extent, this is because environmental grievances tangibly affect people's well-being in ways that state propaganda cannot discount, are shared by people across the political spectrum, and can be framed in patriotic terms. We test expectations using two sets of survey experiments fielded in Russia. The first experiment shows that, holding constant the activities of demonstrators and of the police, demonstrators advancing environmental, as opposed to political, grievances are more likely to be described as law-abiding and as acting in the interests of ordinary people. Their arrests, both in the context of peaceful and violent protests, are also perceived as less justified. Complementing these findings is a second experiment that explores whether citizens are more likely to support demands for greater political accountability when these are articulated in the context of environmental, as opposed to political, protests. Findings suggest that controlling for protesters' political affiliation and tactics, citizens are more likely to approve of demands for the resignation of regional officials when articulated in the context of environmental, as opposed to political, protests.

Yet, the costs associated with reducing carbon emissions to address the changing climate continues to constrain the degree to which governments and voters make necessary changes. In this paper, we study the conditions that induce voters to accept higher costs for collective climate action in international organizations. Specifically, we are interested in how benchmarking the relative vulnerability to climate change and the relative costs associated with climate change policies vis-a-vis other nations influence support for costly collective climate action in international organizations. Using a pre-registered visual survey experiment fielded across all 27 European Union nations following the 2024 European Parliament elections with over 25,000 respondents, we examine the degree to which relative vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change and relative contribution to related costs shape voters’ support for costly climate change policies. Our findings show that when people are informed that their country is a net contributor to the cost of climate action, they become less supportive of the European Green Deal, whereas higher country vulnerability to the effects of climate change has less of an effect. These insights are important to inform scholarly and policy debates on how to garner popular support for international initiatives on climate action.","Keywords: Public opinion, climate change, European Green Deal, Experiments, European Union","Sara Hobolt","Sara Hobolt","London School of Economics","Zachary Dickson","London School of Economics","Heike Kluever","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Đorđe Milosav","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Theresa Kuhn","University of Amsterdam","Toni Rodon","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics","University of Amsterdam","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0486_0456_1076.html","Combating Misogyny: The Role of Male Influencers in Reducing Intergroup Threat","Recent research shows that hard-won advancements in gender equality have been met with a strong backlash among some men, with consequences such as increased resistance to feminist movements, the proliferation of misogynistic rhetoric online, and a rise in support for patriarchal ideologies and policies aimed at reasserting traditional gender roles. Research suggests that this backlash is grounded in perceptions of intergroup threat – that men lose out on increased equality. If that is true, can such attitudes be changed by reducing the perceived threat? In three experiments, we explore if male influencers as “senders” can sway men’s attitudes to be more positive to feminism and less misogynistic. In Experiment 1, we examine whether male senders indeed elicit stronger misogynistic attitudes among males in comparison to female senders, underscoring the role of intergroup threat. Experiment 2 shifts focus to positive messaging, evaluating how messages related to gender equality delivered by male senders impact men’s attitudes toward misogyny. By relying on the literature on moral reframing and intergroup interventions, we explore various messaging frameworks tailored for male senders, ranging from instrumental appeals (e.g., that addressing toxic masculinity norms improves men’s health) to normative justifications (e.g., framing feminism as aligned with the principles of impartiality). Experiment 3 probes whether the status of a male sender affects his influence. Here, we hypothesize that the perceived success of the male sender in traditionally valued domains could enhance his credibility and persuasiveness. Together, these studies offer nuanced insights into leveraging male ingroup dynamics to challenge misogyny.","Keywords: Misogyny, gender equality, gender backlash, moral reframing, persuasion","Đorđe Milosav","Đorđe Milosav","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Hanna Bäck","Lund University","Emma Renström","Kristianstad University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","Lund University","Kristianstad University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Donor-country bureaucrats navigate four dimensions of development effectiveness","Our research asks how 89 randomly sampled development bureaucrats in three OECD member states—Germany, Norway and South Korea—make sense of and pursue the amorphous concept of development effectiveness. Amid waning global norm adherence and a booming evidence industry, our analysis demonstrates the analytical value of distinguishing scales and modes of development effectiveness. In each of the resulting four dimensions, bureaucrats’ pursuit of development effectiveness is mediated by two primary considerations: how to satisfy their political principals, and how to shape public opinion in favour of their policy field. The implications are threefold. First, the four dimensions do not allow for meaningful (re)integration into one coherent concept. Second, a scalar shift of development effectiveness as a policy objective has rendered global processes and macro-level impacts rhetorical reference points as donor-country bureaucrats have refocused their attention to domestic audiences. Third, a purported embrace of evidence-based policy-making also constitutes a tactical move to safeguard national budget allocations through public legitimation. Overall, our findings therefore caution against optimism about an impending evidence revolution as donor bureaucracies have entered yet another era of national interest-driven development politics.","Keywords: development effectiveness, foreign aid, bureaucratic politics, political economy","Heiner Janus, Daniel Esser","Heiner Janus","German Institute of Development Sustainability (IDOS)","Daniel Esser","American University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","German Institute of Development Sustainability (IDOS)","American University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0488_0543_0045.html","Exploring party dynamics and welfare transformations in family policy: Evidence from a new reform database","Family policy has become one of the most dynamic areas in welfare state politics. It is marked by unexpected path departure in least-likely countries under fiscal constraints and radical shifts in party agendas. Most conservative parties have switched from traditional to progressive stances, supporting employment-oriented policies and men’s caregiving roles. This has attracted significant scholarly interest in explaining reform trajectories and party shifts. However, existing research often relies on imperfect dependent variable indicators, such as outcome or expenditure measures, which are prone to confounding factors and temporal lags.This paper presents findings from a novel, hand-coded database of family policy reforms, documenting over 600 policy changes across six conservative welfare states between 1980 and 2019: Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. By focusing on legal outputs, the database aligns directly policy change with political decision-making, reducing confounding influences present in outcome-based measures. The dataset encompasses reforms in key areas such as parental leave, childcare, family benefits, labour market regulation, and gender equality measures.Employing autoregression and multivariate linear models, the study tests competing explanations for these reforms, including cabinet composition, public opinion, functional determinants, gender representation, and policy feedback effects. The study offers empirically robust findings for understanding the political drivers of family policy reform, contributing to debates on comparative party politics and welfare state transformation.","Keywords: Comparative welfare politics, Christian-democracy, conservative welfare states, gender equality, public policy.","Manuel Alvariño","Manuel Alvariño",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0489_0918_0112.html","Pressure from the ‘extremes’: electoral competition and environmental taxes in rich democracies","According to the OECD, energy taxes are the best way to change people’s energy consumption behaviour in the long run and a necessary tool towards decarbonisation (OECD 2016). Yet, energy taxes have, in fact, been declining in most West European countries, especially in the last decade. Why have economically advanced democracies not increased the cost of energy consumption?We argue that governments, of both the left and the right, have become less willing to hike energy taxes because they fear the political backlash against energy taxes. To understand the potential electoral consequences of raising energy taxes, we need to better understand the policy preferences of parties’ core constituents but also the electoral competition mainstream parties face, both from the right and the left.This paper makes three contributions: first, it theorises and investigates parties’ ‘vulnerability’ to energy taxes both internally and externally. Internally, it looks at how divisive energy taxes are for the party’s core electorates, using ESS survey data. Second, looking from an inter-party perspective at external pressures it investigates the extent to which radical right parties systematically diverge in their positions on energy taxes compared to mainstream parties by analysing parliamentary speeches across European countries. Third, it tests the role of electoral competition on environmental taxes both in EU countries using Eurostat data as well as in a larger sample of advanced democracies using IMF data on environmental taxes.","Keywords: Environmental taxes, radical right, electoral competition, rich democracies","Despina Alexiadou","Despina Alexiadou","University of Strathclyde"," Christine Sylvester","University of Strathclyde","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Strathclyde",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They suggest that the often-found positive relationship between taxation and accountability may be driven by something that is not inherent to taxation and can thus be manipulated: individuals’ feelings of ownership over the budget and/or information regarding its size. We contribute to this literature by conducting a survey-based field experiment among 1,950 respondents in Peruvian districts benefiting from mining fees. Our experiment manipulates both the source of revenues (local taxes vs resource rents) and the level of ownership over the budget, while keeping its size constant. This allows us to disentangle the effects of information from those of ownership. We report multiple findings: citizens feel higher levels of ownership over tax revenues than resource rents, but low tax awareness limits the extent of ownership over tax revenues; ownership over tax revenues has a positive effect on willingness to monitor local governments but does not affect behaviors; and the source of revenues matters for the type of accountability that is demanded, with tax revenues associated with more particularistic demands than resource rents.","Keywords: resource curse, taxation, accountability, Peru","Taiwo Ahmed","Mariana Alvarado","University of Geneva","Taiwo Ahmed","University of Gothenburg","Aksel Sundstrom","University of Gothenburg","Sverker Jagers","University of Gothenburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Geneva","University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0491_0716_0512.html","Balancing Versatility and Precision: A Framework for Capturing Legislative Design Choices in Democratic Systems","We introduce a conceptual framework for analysing legislative designs in democratic systems, emphasizing two core dimensions: versatility and precision. A law’s versatility reflects (a) the breadth of its topical coverage, (b) the diversity of target audiences it addresses, and (c) the range of policy instruments it combines. The precision of a law is a consequence of (a) the vagueness of its language, (b) the extent to which it allows for derogations, and (c) the discretion it leaves to the bureaucracy through delegation provisions. These dimensions highlight the trade-offs legislators face between adaptability and inclusiveness, on one hand, and legal certainty and specificity, on the other.Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing tools, this study proposes a systematic approach to capture these dimensions in legislative texts, presenting initial findings from the European Union. Integrating insights from public policy and legal scholarship, we explore how laws differ across policy domains, institutional contexts, and time, shedding light on the dynamics of democratic governance.This work addresses a critical gap in legislative analysis, where studies often remain confined to specific policy areas. The proposed typology—ranging from versatile but imprecise “sledgehammers” to narrowly focused yet precise “scalpels”—provides a robust tool for understanding legislative trade-offs. It opens avenues for examining whether domain-specific demands, institutional structures, or universal patterns shape legislative designs. Ultimately, our approach deepens our understanding of the structures of democratic legislation. It offers policymakers, legal practitioners, and scholars a framework to navigate and improve legislative designs, enhancing democratic accountability amid increasingly intricate governance challenges.","Keywords: Legislative Design, Democratic Governance, Natural Langauge Processing","Constantin Kaplaner","Mike Cowburn","Zeppelin University, Friedrichshafen","Steffen Hurka","Zeppelin University, Friedrichshafen","Constantin Kaplaner","Zeppelin University, Friedrichshafen; LMU, Munich","Stefanie Rueß","Zeppelin University, Friedrichshafen","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zeppelin University, Friedrichshafen","LMU, Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0492_1605_0233.html","Geopolitics Meets Economic Interests: Business Lobbying Amid Security Concerns","From semiconductor export bans to China to investment screening mechanisms, contemporary trade policy is increasingly linked to national security. How do business actors lobby in the context of this geopoliticization of trade? We argue that business actors primarily defend their short-term economic interests, even amidst geopolitical challenges. As a result, we expect the potential beneficiaries of relatively free trade such as exporting industries to downplay the security implications of trade policies, while import-competing business interests should emphasize these implications to bolster their position.We test this argument using novel data from public consultations on several trade policy measures recently discussed in Australia, the European Union, and the United States. The analysis focuses on seven policies directly or indirectly related to China that are in process or were already implemented in all these jurisdictions and for which consultations were held. Employing computational text analysis on around 1500 consultation submissions, we examine how business actors frame their positions. We then regress the resulting measure on the economic competitiveness of the sectors these actors represent. Since most participants in consultations are business associations rather than individual firms, the analysis is conducted at the sectoral level. In robustness checks, however, we replace associations with the five largest member companies to conduct analyses at the firm level. A qualitative case study drawing on interviews sheds light on the causal mechanism.The paper contributes to research on lobbying, trade policymaking, and the role of geopolitics in the contemporary world economy.","Keywords: Lobbying, political economy of trade, computational text analysis, security","Denis Anwar Haghighi, Andreas Dür, Gemma Mateo","Denis Anwar Haghighi","University of Salzburg"," Andreas Dür","University of Salzburg"," Gemma Mateo","University of Salzburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Salzburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0493_0816_1157.html","Targeted Negativity Towards Women in the (Political) Media","Anecdotal and scholarly reports have long highlighted that women in the media are more likely to face hostility and abuse from the public both directly and indirectly as a response to their reporting when compared to their male counterparts. These disparities may be amplified on social media, where toxic and negative content is increasingly prevalent. To date, however, there is little in the way of comprehensive analysis on the exact extent to which female journalists may be subject to more negativity online, nor of the exact contexts in which this negativity is most likely to occur. With this in mind, this paper analyses the content of over 50,000,000 replies sent to over 1,400 U.S. media accounts on Twitter across 2022. Based on a first-of-kind machine learning classifier of what is specifically defined as “targeted negativity” in online messaging, the results show, centrally, that female journalists do indeed receive higher levels of targeted negativity than male journalists, with this disparity being greatest among journalists who work for more ideologically extreme media outlets. Importantly, the specific content of a journalists reporting is also a central driver of negativity, with reporting by female journalists on politics and in particular about “women’s issues” receiving the highest levels of negative responses. These results provide large-scale insights into hostile engagement faced by journalists on social media, as well as into the specific reporting contexts in which women journalists may face the most negative engagement from the public.","Keywords: Gender, Social Media, Machine Learning, Negativity, Media","Michael Heseltine","Michael Heseltine",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0494_1393_0564.html","National identity and attitudes towards immigration","This research proposal seeks to explore the relationship between national identities and public attitudes toward immigration. According to longstanding frameworks in social psychology, strong attachment to an in-group—such as heightened nationalistic feelings—is often associated with negative attitudes toward out-groups. However, empirical evidence on this relationship remains inconsistent. While some studies find that strong national identities correlate with anti-immigration attitudes, the effect varies depending on how nationalism is measured, across geographical regions (i.e. differences between mostly pro-immigration Scottish, and mostly anti-immigration Flemish nationalism), and over time (i.e. Catalan nationalism being mostly pro-immigration in the last decade, and now going through a hardening turn in latest public opinion data). We refine and advance several pre-registered hypotheses concerning the canonical distinction between civic and cultural conceptions of national identity, bottom-up societal changes vs top-down elite narratives, strategic liberal narratives of minority protection by nationalist movements, historical legacies of trade openness and industrialisation in need of migrant workers, and zero-sum relationships between centre-periphery and immigration conflicts. We will rely on survey vignette experiments embedded in large, well-powered and representative surveys (N = 8,000) in Catalonia fielded by the Centre d'Estudis d’Opinio, comparing the effect of our treatments across Catalan, Spanish, and dual identities. Our study provides a theoretically novel take on national identity which challenges its status as a stable product of long-term socialization, and a rigorous empirical approach based on causal estimates.","Keywords: nationalism, attitudes towards immigration, survey experiments","Sergi Pardos-Prado","Sergi Pardos-Prado","University of Glasgow","Raül Tormos","Centre Estudis Opinio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","Centre Estudis Opinio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0495_0363_0435.html","The Cost of Militias: Weakening Civilian Control in Post-Conflict Governance","Existing research demonstrates that strong civilian control reduces the risk of civil war recurrence in post-conflict societies. However, little is known about the factors that erode civilian control after conflicts end. This paper argues that governments in post-conflict societies that form new militias to manage domestic opposition experience a weakening of civilian control. Specifically, two causal mechanisms explain how the creation of militias contributes to the decline of civilian authority. First, while post-conflict civilian governments often establish militias to lessen their dependence on the military, this strategy paradoxically strengthens the military’s inclination to challenge civilian authority. Second, the use of militias against domestic opposition undermines the government’s legitimacy, creating vulnerabilities that the military can exploit to further weaken civilian control. I test these arguments using data on pro-government militias (PGMs) formed after the conclusion of civil wars between 1981 and 2014. The findings reveal robust statistical support for these claims, and the results hold across a variety of model specifications, providing strong evidence for the negative effects of militias on civilian control in post-conflict settings.","Keywords: Civilian control; militias; post-conflict governance","Rizwan Asghar","Rizwan Asghar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Trinity College Dublin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, we explore the factors that shape voter punishment of criminal politicians, including political polarization, media coverage, incumbency, and electoral competition.

"abstract_0497_2437_0623.html","Estamos Listas: The effect of identity-based parties on political minorities' participation","Political minorities often seek to enhance their representation by developing identity-based political movements. These initiatives are especially crucial in non-consolidated democracies, where party machines dominate the political space, and segments of the electorate feel alienated from democratic institutions. Previous research examining the fates of group-based party strategies has yielded mixed results on translating these movements into empowering political initiatives. This study contributes to the field by examining a novel case involving a women-led movement, the Colombian political party Estamos Listas, which successfully ran for the city council of Medellín after mobilizing 40,000 signatures and securing 28,000 votes within a year. We first assess the impact of Estamos Listas on increasing women's political turnout by analyzing detailed polling station data disaggregated by gender. Using a difference-in-differences design, we compare turnout trends between men-majority and women-majority polling stations before and during Estamos Listas' inaugural election in 2019. Results indicate that Estamos Listas positively influenced women's electoral participation, increasing their turnout by 1.3 percentage points, a raise that correlates with vote-shares obtained by the party. To better understand the dynamics behind this change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Estamos Listas' leaders. Qualitative evidence suggests that the party leveraged pre-existing social connections between women to create a network that fostered a sense of belonging to the political realm. This paper contributes to understanding how identity-based parties can electorally mobilize their target group and thus empower political minorities.","Keywords: political participation, political minorities, gender and politics, mobilization, group-based appeals","Nerea Gandara Guerra","Nerea Gandara Guerra","EAFIT University"," Sergi Martinez Soler","EAFIT University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"EAFIT University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0498_1791_1235.html","The Influence of Collective Action on Public Policy in Autocracies: Evidence from China","We study whether collective action can influence public policy in autocracies and, if so, under what conditions. Existing literature suggests that authoritarian governments can respond to the particularistic demands of ordinary people who take collective action. However, it is unclear whether such collective action can push authoritarian governments to make or adjust public policies that go beyond particular contention and apply to a broader population. We argue that ordinary people acting collectively can pressure local governments in autocracies to make policy concessions. Specifically, ordinary people taking collective action in autocracies have deep-rooted grievances over local living conditions. These grievances give rise to morality- or reciprocity-based demands, making it difficult for officials in local governments to repress ordinary people or ignore their demands. Moreover, officials in local governments have career incentives to reduce the likelihood of collective action driven by localized grievances, and they have discretion over the details of policy implementation to make concessions to ordinary people. We plan to empirically examine the arguments by studying the relationship between strikes initiated by workers and labor and social policy made by prefectural governments in China. We have collected data on the frequency of strikes at the prefecture level and are collecting labor policy documents issued by Chinese prefectural governments. We will run a two-way fixed-effects model with the panel data, and we plan to consider an instrumental variable strategy for causal inference. This project's findings will shed light on the consequences of contentious politics and the dynamics of policymaking in autocracies.","Keywords: collective action, public policy, strikes, social welfare, China","Yuequan Guo","Yuequan Guo","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Hsu Yumin WANG","National Tsing Hua University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","National Tsing Hua University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Assuming differential abilities of interest groups to overcome collective action problems, we argue that business interests are over-represented in particular at higher levels of the political system. In order to assess the size and direction of business bias in interest representation, the distributions of actor types at different levels have to be mapped and compared. In this paper, we will map interest group populations on the subnational, national, and European level and their mobilization across different policy areas. Our analysis starts with the subnational level by mapping all groups based in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. To determine the set of active organizations on the three levels, we then trace which of these interest groups are present in the respective lobby and transparency registers in order to capture groups’ political mobilization. Controlling for delegation to umbrella groups and direct corporate lobbying, our analysis will address a lack of attention to multilevel dynamics in interest group populations and yield important insight in the equality of political representation.","Keywords: European Union, Federalism, Interest Groups, Lobbying, Representation.","Florian Spohr","Patrick Bernhagen","University of Stuttgart, Department of Political Science and Political Sociology."," Florian Spohr","University of Stuttgart, Department of Political Science and Political Sociology.","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Stuttgart, Department of Political Science and Political Sociology.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0500_1703_0808.html","Measuring Populism and its Sub-Dimensions Using Large Language Models","Populism has emerged as a pervasive phenomenon, manifesting primarily among radical right and radical left political actors and citizens, and influencing democracy, political culture, policy-making, and political behaviour. A key challenge in studying populism -- and its core conceptual components, such as people-centeredness, anti-elitism, and a Manichean worldview -- lies in effectively analyzing political actors' texts, including manifestos, speeches, and social media posts. While human coding has been a reliable method, it is too resource-intensive to scale to large corpora and requires both domain-specific knowledge as well as the ability to read the texts in their original languages. Automated text-as-data approaches, on the other hand, frequently fail to detect populism and its sub-dimensions, often yielding low accuracy even in prototypical cases. We propose a solution using GPT-class Large Language Models (LLMs) using instruction tuning to mimic human coding behaviour, but at scale and without natural language limitations or any requirement for pre-processing or even document conversion. Unlike earlier generations of machine learning approaches, LLMs can accurately identify populism and its sub-dimensions, even when facing a needle-in-the-haystack problem of low-frequency populist statements. We validate our approach by (a) comparing LLM-derived populism scores with established expert surveys on party-based populism and (b) benchmarking sub-dimensions against results from human coding.","Keywords: populism,

However, numerous debates regarding the potential positive and negative outcomes associated with BRI projects and investments have received increasing attention by policymakers and researchers. Often narratives of debt-trap diplomacy, economic coercion, and strategic influence are juxtaposed against arguments of BRI providing needed infrastructure development and non-Western investment.

Despite comprising 14.6% of Germany’s population in 2022, immigrants from non-EU countries lack voting rights in local elections, except through integration councils. These councils have very limited political powers and integration council elections have low voter turnout. This study examines knowledge of and attitudes toward integration councils, as well as public attitudes toward extending non-citizen voting rights in local elections. To do so, we use a random sample from official registers of the urban population of ten German cities, including an oversample of foreign-born populations. Focusing on the role of classic and migration-specific individual-level predictors, as well as regional variations in the institutional setup of integration councils and local political culture, our empirical results indicate that knowledge that integration councils exist is low, especially among non-nationals from non-EU countries. While people generally appreciate that these councils exist, we find individual and group-specific differences in support of expanding the powers and non-citizen suffrage that are mainly explained by general beliefs about immigration and solidarity. To further explore public opinion on this specific form of minority representation, we will conduct a conjoint experiment that varies institutional features (e.g., powers, composition) of integration councils. The results will provide insights into which aspects strengthen the social acceptance of bodies that facilitate ethnic minority representation.","Keywords: integration councils, minority representation, political integration, Germany, conjoint experiment","Conrad Ziller","Conrad Ziller","University of Duisburg-Essen"," Teresa Hummler","University of Duisburg-Essen"," Paul Vierus","University of Duisburg-Essen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Duisburg-Essen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A key challenge lies in addressing opposition from groups who feel unfairly impacted by the costs these policies create (Colantone et al., 2024). This article tackles a timely and only piecewise studied type of climate policy - wind energy. While wind energy has become an increasingly important tool for meeting climate targets in time, local opposition to project proposals is widespread (Suskevics et al., 2019). This conflict has accentuated the (un)fairness of turbine distribution, and of which communities that are expected to take them on.This article takes a broad approach to the wind expansion question, looking at its role in a larger distributive conflict (See Aklin & Mildenberger, 2020) both in terms of where turbines are placed, how existing patterns of inequalities may shape local attitudes, and whether the institutional set-up shape how much local attitudes matter for deployment. Largely lacking from the literature are analyses of the overall geographic patterns of local attitudes that go beyond case-specific wind farm characteristics and subgroup focuses, and investigations of how institutional contexts interact with such patterns. By utilizing two decades of Swedish representative public opinion data, geo-tagged turbine registers, and a mid-sample institutional change, I study how geographic variation of material inequality and discontent relate to local attitudes, and to turbine placement. Lastly, these links are studied comparatively before and after a local veto was introduced in Sweden, showcasing the contextual role of institutionalized community veto points.","Keywords: Wind Energy, Distributional Conflict, Public Opinion, Veto Point","Milla Marzelius","Milla Marzelius",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg, Department of Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0504_1247_1372.html","The Cost of Compliance – Exploring Normative Beliefs and Climate Policy Vulnerability","Climate change mitigation policies contribute to a global public good. However, they often impose disproportionate burdens on policy-vulnerable groups, undermining public support for effective climate action. Simultaneously, social norms about appropriate climate-friendly behavior exert social pressure, potentially influencing individuals’ preferences. Despite the importance of normative guidelines, little is known about the costs of complying with them. Thus, I ask the question if citizens choose to adjust their preferences to comply with social norms when they perceive the cost of such adjustments as prohibitive. To address this question, I conduct a pre-registered belief updating experiment in the framework of the Austrian National Election Study (N=3,000) in early 2025. I provide information treatments based on representative data to target citizens’ normative expectations about energy saving and food consumption and assess the effect of such treatments on mitigation policy preferences. I expect these updates to impact preferences differently depending on individuals’ initial over- or underestimation of social norms. Additionally, I expect that citizens with high perceived policy vulnerability are less affected by this treatment. In more detail, I conjecture that highly vulnerable citizens are more hesitant to support intrusive push mitigation policies after a normative belief update. In comparison, they may show greater willingness to adjust their preferences positively for pull mitigation policies. The study’s findings contribute to understanding how social norms and perceived vulnerability jointly shape policy preferences. They offer insights for designing climate policies that address short-term challenges while fostering broader public support for ambitious climate action.","Keywords: social norms, policy vulnerability, climate policy, belief updating","Benedikt Seisl","Benedikt Seisl",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0506_0257_1013.html","Celebrating in the Battlefield: The Politics of Framing Equality on International Women’s Day","While gender equality has gained significant traction across the globe, it has also been increasingly politicised. Anti-gender opposition has dramatically expanded. At the same time, critiques have been raised among pro-equality actors about the lack of inclusivity.This paper investigates how equality is strategically defined, at a snapshot in time; the highly symbolic moment of International Women’s Day. We analyse how equality is framed, whose equality it is, and what the ways forward are that are promoted by these actors. International Women’s Day is a celebration of the achievements toward equality and emphasizes challenges that remained to be tackled. This is a day when divergent perspectives about equality are strategically showcased. Pro- and anti-equality actors seize the occasion to promote their vision of equality and compete against alternative visions. We contend that to do so they strategically select and bundle policy issues from a wide range of equality issues. With limited space and resources, they make choices about the issues that they deem worth of attention across public arenas, such as the parliament and social media.Drawing on latent class analysis of parliamentary questions and tweets posted on X on international women’s days between 2019 and 2023 across 10 European countries (Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, and the United Kingdom) we map the political battlefield around gender equality. We shed light on the extent to which parliamentary and civil society agendas overlap to offer a taxology of issue positions and constellation of actors.","Keywords: issue competition, gender equality, politicization, policy agenda, social media","Isabelle Engeli","Isabelle Engeli","University of Exeter","Rebekka Kesberg","University of Amsterdam","Liza Mügge","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Exeter","University of Amsterdam","University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Do the mechanisms behind this effect differ for right- and left-wing women? While research has widely recognized visible female leaders as role models driving women’s political participation, little is known about the role model effect of right-wing female leaders, particularly those with overtly anti-feminist agendas.Focusing on the political ideology of both leaders and the public, I argue that while role model effect (i.e., the erosion of negative social norms surrounding female leadership) influences both right- and left-wing women’s political participation, left-wing women’s participation is further mobilized by opposition to anti-feminist reforms. Using a survey experiment conducted on a representative sample of the Italian population (n = 3,000), I compare the effects of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s political leadership and agenda on left- and right-wing women’s participation.The findings enhance our understanding of the role model effect in ideological contexts and contribute broadly to the analysis of trends in women’s political behaviour in countries led by prominent right-wing female figures.","Keywords: Role model effect, Women’s political participation, Political ideology, Right-wing, Italy","Marta Antonetti","Marta Antonetti","London School of Economics and Political Science","Florian Foos","London School of Economics and Political Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, BMZ and Norad staff exhibit different appreciations of substantive knowledge and individual experience rooted in distinct organisational objectives and norms. At BMZ, substantive knowledge is expendable but individual experience is considered non-substitutable, and expertise focusses on navigating political priorities. At Norad, substantive knowledge is a condition for career advancement; experience ideally leverages such knowledge, jointly constituting expertise.

Scholars broadly agree that structural economic change have rendered significant numbers of citizens economically insecure, making them ripe for mobilization by far right actors. However, individuals similarly affected by structural change still vote differently. This article proposes that citizens will be more likely to respond to economic insecurity by moving to the far right, when they are embedded in a social network that consists of structurally vulnerable citizens. Building on insights from classical work in political sociology, we argue that the political translation of economic turmoil takes place through discussions with close relationships.Following citizens in the Netherlands from the onset of the Great Recession, a period of economic insecurity and growing far right support, we find that citizens embedded in structurally vulnerable networks, compared to citizens with at least one high-educated tie, were less likely to respond economic insecurity by moving to the far right. We find similar results in the US, where we find that the effect of increased import competition from China on Trump voting is moderated by network composition.We then probe mechanisms using panel survey data linked to register data of the entire Dutch population, and an original survey in the UK. We find evidence that social influence in networks is more likely to account for their effect than the enhanced economic resources that higher-SES relationships can provide. These results suggest that far right support crystallizes in socioeconomically segregated groups.","Keywords: Far right, social networks, voting, economic voting, economic insecurity","Jona de Jong","Jona de Jong",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper examines how the liberalization of abortion laws affects women's institutional trust. We argue that abortion legalization represents both a tangible expansion of state-provided healthcare and a symbolic recognition of women's autonomy. The policy change operates through two mechanisms: first, by providing concrete improvements in women's reproductive freedom, health, and safety; and second, by signaling the state's commitment to universal rights and gender equality. Drawing on performance-based theories of political support, we hypothesize that legalization enhances institutional trust among women, with particularly strong effects among those of reproductive age and secular backgrounds. We leverage Mexico's recent subnational variation in abortion laws to test this argument, employing a difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered timing of liberalization across states. Using LAPOP survey data, we compare trust levels between states before and after policy changes. This study contributes to our understanding of how reproductive rights policies shape state-society relations while providing novel evidence from a context where religious and cultural factors make abortion reform particularly contentious.","Keywords: Institutional Trust; Reproductive Rights; Women's Rights; Policy Feedback; Mexico","Francisca Castro","Frida Nilsson","University of Gothenburg","Francisca Castro","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0511_0885_0202.html","Authoritarian Party Building, Elites' Retention, and the Effects on Clientelism","Virtually every autocracy is governed with the help of a ruling party. However, why are some authoritarian ruling parties more entrenched in society than others? In this paper, we argue that increasing the size of authoritarian ruling parties requires stable national elites – i.e., members of the parliament (MPs) – who can invest in party-building efforts without the threat of being replaced by the leader. However, authoritarian ruling party-building strategies present a challenging trade-off between creating or expanding new network and maintaining them through redistribution practices. More stable national elites allow for the creation of extended networks, yet larger authoritarian ruling parties also require heavier investments in returns to membership. Although increasing the size of an authoritarian ruling party brings stronger organizational capacity, it also facilitates the development of clientelist ties. To test this theory, we compile and use novel data on legislative retention rates and ruling parties’ size in 20 autocracies between 1921 and 2020. Implementing hierarchical and linear models, we show that higher retention rates have a positive effect on party size whilst more expansive party-building under high retention rates is also associated with higher levels of clientelism. Furthermore, we use Vietnam as a case study to test the internal validity of the argument by geolocating every party office of the ruling party, matching these with MPs' place of origin, and testing these effects on sub-national clientelistic levels using readily available survey data between 2011-2023. Ultimately, these results present new implications for the authoritarian political strength-economic performance nexus.","Keywords: Autocracy, Political Institutions, Ruling Parties, Legislatures, Clientelism","Fabio Angiolillo","Fabio Angiolillo","University of Gothenburg","Felix Wiebrecht","University of Liverpool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","University of Liverpool",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from side job disclosures and moonlighting in Germany","The assumption that increased transparency improves political accountability is widely accepted. However, little is known about how government-targeted transparency affects the behaviour of elected representatives. Using a purposely created dataset, this paper will test whether disclosure-induced transparency affects MPs behaviour by analysing the outside jobs held by politicians subjected to different types of disclosure regulations. Building on existing research, I hypothesise that greater scrutiny about outside earnings reduces incentives to pursue side jobs, and that this is stronger amongst electorally vulnerable MPs, namely those seeking re-election and facing high political competition. Additionally, I argue that private sector side jobs, which are most unpopular with the electorate, should be expected to decline most when subjected to increased transparency. The analysis utilises a novel dataset on the extra-parliamentary behaviour of MPs from the German Bundestag and 16 State Parliaments, spanning over 40 legislative periods in the last two decades, and covering the moonlighting activities of over 30,000 legislator/year cases. The results have implications for our understanding of effective government-targeted transparency, political blame avoidance, legislative behaviour and electoral accountability.","Keywords: transparency, accountability, outside earnings, parliament","Lukas Seibert","Lukas Seibert",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Backlash against gender is on the rise across Western European democracies and commonly propagated on digital media that lack traditional journalistic gate-keeping. Previous research shows a tension in right-wing actors rhetoric on gender: while they have been shown to be key protagonists in the spread of traditional family values and anti-gender ideas, the same actors also increasingly appropriate liberal gender themes for the promotion of anti-immigrant stances. However, researchers lack a systematic understanding of the prevalence of gender backlash and appropriation on contemporary social media, which themes are used in that context, who the key actors are, under which conditions they chose different themes, and the extent to which these resonate with audiences. To advance these questions, this study explores right-wing gender themes on the visual social media platform TikTok in five Western European countries. Employing computational text analysis methods such as dictionaries and narrative mining, this paper seeks to discover, categorize and quantify gender themes by right-wing actors.","Keywords: social media, gender backlash, femonationalism, TikTok, text-as-data","Sophie Mainz","Sophie Mainz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Uppsala University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that the effect of violence is asymmetric and predominantly benefits nationalist, radical-right parties. Posing as defenders of the nation, nationalist parties benefit from violence by their political opponents and violence targeted against perceived threats to the nation. To test this conjecture, we collect novel actor-based and geospatial data of political violence in Weimar Germany. Using a staggered difference-in-differences estimator, we model the effect of violence on vote shares of anti-system parties at the municipality-level in all nine parliamentary elections between 1919 and 1933. Our results indicate increasing electoral support for the extreme nationalist parties in municipalities that experienced violence committed by either the far right or left. In contrast, the radical left Communist party loses electoral support if violence occurs. We investigate heterogeneous effects with respect to the type of violence, across elections, and the socio-economic characteristics of municipalities. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our finding for increasing violence in liberal democracies today.","Keywords: electoral violence, voting for anti-system parties, nationalism, historical research, democratic backsliding","Nils-Christian Bormann","Nils-Christian Bormann","Department of Philosophy, Politics & Economics, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany"," Edoardo Vigano","Department of Philosophy, Politics & Economics, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Philosophy, Politics & Economics, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It posits that detecting where civilians' loyalties lie provides the government with an opportunity to implement indiscriminate measures selectively at a minimal cost. I argue that governments are less likely to impose curfews if alienating civilians may result in losing control of a locality to insurgents, making heavily insurgent loyalist populated localities more susceptible to curfew imposition. Furthermore, implementing curfews selectively in certain districts allows civilians to escape the affected areas to safer regions, allowing counterinsurgents to conduct more operations in residential areas. Using regression discontinuity design, I find that civilian loyalties influence the government's decision to impose curfews. Further analyses suggest that these curfews lead civilians to flee their homes while giving more operational freedom to counterinsurgents in urban areas.","Keywords: counterinsurgency, curfew, displacement, civilian loyalties","Burak Kazim Yilmaz","Burak Kazim Yilmaz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Emory University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0518_2135_0618.html","Elite polarization, voters' choices, and the decline of electoral accountability","Does elite polarization lead to a decline in electoral accountability? Recent research has found that ideological polarization is usually driven by elites, only later spreading to the public at large. In this paper, we argue that elite polarization reduces electoral accountability even when levels of mass and affective polarization do not change. As the candidates’ policy platforms diverge, voters increasingly forgo accountability because the electoral importance of valence issues decreases, including for matters such as competence, effective governance, corruption and economic outcomes. Original experimental evidence from three countries (United States, United Kingdom, Spain, total N = 4,200), in which we manipulate policy polarization and partisan identities separately, confirms that higher levels of candidate polarization cause reductions in accountability-driven voting. Qualitative evidence from voters’ own words shows that cognitive, in-group or partisan biases, such as partisan motivated reasoning or blind partisanship, are not necessary to explain declines in electoral accountability. Instead, many voters rationally forgo accountability in polarized contexts because they are aware of the representation-accountability trade-off. We generalize these experimental results with observational analyses of post-electoral surveys in 26 advanced democracies. This study carries important implications, suggested in earlier formal models: poor valence candidates have an incentive to strategically increase electoral polarization to escape electoral punishment.","Keywords: Candidate polarization, Electoral accountability, Voters' decision-making, Electoral trade-offs, Multi-method research","Mafalda Pratas","Mafalda Pratas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building on theories of policy change and regulatory capture, this research investigates dynamics of regulatory self-shielding in response to policy shocks. I define self-shielding as regulators insulating their policy decisions from external influence by limiting certain interest groups’ access to them. Focusing on the European Commission’s short- and long-term response to the 2022 energy crisis, I explore both changes in the composition of the energy policy community and interest groups’ preference attainment. I argue that, based on the nature of the policy response (urgent or structural) the Commission maintained relatively closer engagement with interest groups with an established relationship with the Commission, while limiting the access of new interest groups. Similarly, when policy change is dictated by a crisis, interest groups’ lobbying efforts and expenditures yield diminishing returns on access and preference attainment due to regulators’ efforts to shield decision-making. I explore changes in the constellation of the policy community and lobbying success before and after the March 2022 crisis. I use EU Transparency Register’s historical data and interest group’s position papers on five crisis-response emergency measures, the ""RePower EU Plan"", and the reform of the EU electricity market. While trends in lobbying data reveal an unprecedented increase in the energy industry’s EU lobbying since 2022, preliminary statistical findings paradoxically indicate that greater lobbying traffic is associated with restricted access to policymakers and diminished overall prospects of regulatory capture.","Keywords: Interest groups, access, influence, energy crisis, self-shielding","Camilla Sante","Camilla Sante",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Université de Genève",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This approach identifies which type of content—manifestos, official communications, or politicians’ posts—most influences perceptions of party ideology.The study hypothesises that mainstream and extreme parties both present more moderate positions in their manifestos and use more polarized narrative on social media. Additionally, the research explores a potential “social media fringe-to-mainstream pipeline,” where radical ideas shift into broader party narratives.By incorporating temporal dynamics, including Twitter data from January to June 2023 and positions throughout the parliamentary term, the study captures variations in ideological presentation during and outside election campaigns. These findings contribute to understanding how party ideology is strategically adapted across platforms and the differing roles of mainstream and extreme parties in shaping public perceptions through digital communication.","Keywords: party positions, Large Language Models, left-right, party manifestos, social media","Rosa M.

We do this by comparing the still-developing trade in renewables with the existing and supposedly OPEC+-dominated fossil fuel trade. We develop hypotheses based on technological and economic aspects and test them using various social network metrics. Through this comparison, we want to understand whether the renewable energy trade is developing freely or constrained.For this purpose, we use the fossil fuel trade as a negative and combine it with institutional benchmarks. We use a broad sample of trade data from 1991 to 2022. We find that trade in renewable products displays more supplier-diverse, interconnected, and robust attributes. The aforementioned aspects highlight the non-ecology-related advantages of renewable energy technology over fossil fuels.However, we identify emerging risks, such as elevated market concentration in fossil fuels, mainly through developed economies. Conversely, we detect that developed economies rapidly lose market share in critical products like photovoltaics to developing nations, particularly a rapidly ascending China, giving some credibility to future dependency concerns. Altogether, current dependency appears overstated, even in fossil fuels.

Their massive deployment to the hardest-hit areas of Valencia was widely praised by local residents and quickly gained media attention. In this context, our pre-registered hypotheses focus on whether individuals who directly or indirectly benefited from cooperative actions attributed to firefighters from a territorial out-group are more likely to reciprocate by engaging in cooperative behavior with other members of that same out-group.","Keywords: Territorial politics, Out-group animosity, Prejudice reduction, Cooperative contact, Reciprocity Experiment","Amuitz Garmendia Madariaga","Amuitz Garmendia Madariaga","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Instituto Carlos III - Juan March","Sandra León","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Instituto Carlos III - Juan March","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0525_1410_1371.html","Can Regional Compensation Mechanisms Increase Support for Carbon Taxes? Evidence from Austria","As climate change urgency intensifies, carbon taxation is widely seen as essential for reducing emissions by making carbon use more costly. However, public support is critical for successful implementation, and research highlights that support often depends on perceptions of fairness, particularly regarding disproportionate impacts on specific groups. Policymakers address such concerns by redistributing tax revenues to mitigate inequities. For example, rural residents, who face higher fuel costs due to greater car dependency and limited public transport, can receive targeted compensation to balance these effects.This study examines the effectiveness of regional revenue recycling in addressing equity concerns, using Austria as a case study. Austria is uniquely positioned for this research, as it is the only country with a yearly lump-sum payment system that adjusts payouts based on rurality and public infrastructure access.Drawing on AUTNES data, the study analyzes how regional differences in support for carbon taxes evolved throughout the implementation process, including the tax itself and associated compensation mechanisms. A survey experiment further explores the relationship between citizens’ awareness of regional revenue recycling and their support for the tax.The findings have broader implications for policymakers in other countries facing similar equity challenges. If Austria’s regional compensation system is shown to increase support for carbon taxation, it could serve as a model for balancing regional inequalities in climate policies. Conversely, a null result would highlight the need to explore alternative strategies for building public acceptance of emissions-reduction measures.","Keywords: climate policy, carbon tax support, survey experiments, compensation mechanisms","Theresa Wieland","Theresa Wieland",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Empirical evidence consistently shows that men are more likely than women to support populist radical right parties, though this gender gap is often overemphasised (Spierings & Zaslove, 2015). This paper considers populist attitudes as an explanatory factor for the gender gap through socialisation and explores a new causal mechanism: caregiving, focusing on two life transitions: childbearing and eldercare.Prior research primarily examines life transitions and populist attitudes through economic lenses (Davou & Demertzis, 2014; Kriesi & Pappas, 2015) and without adopting a longitudinal perspective. Childbearing, a pivotal event, affects men and women differently. While motherhood demobilises women politically (Bhatti et al., 2018), their engagement remains intact (Jennings, 1983). We posit that childbearing heightens awareness of political issues like social policies, childcare, and education, influencing populist attitudes.Eldercare, by contrast, imposes emotional, physical, and financial strains that constrain social participation (Hirst, 2004). These responsibilities may reduce populist attitudes by disrupting socialisation and amplifying concerns about eldercare options.We expect that gender moderates these effects, as caregiving is usually associated with traditional gender roles. This paper develops a novel theoretical framework by combining these caring-related life transitions and how they affect populist attitudes, including gender, using panel data collected in Spain between 2019 and 2024. Fixed-effect models reveal that having a child affects men by decreasing their populist attitudes, and the relationship between eldercare and populism is not affected by gender, although it decreases populist attitudes.","Keywords: populism, life transitions, gender, caregiving","María Ruiz Hernández","María Ruiz Hernández",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0528_0789_1109.html","Can bottom-up governance overcome local political resistance? The case of solar park deployment in the Netherlands","Decisions about renewable energy occur at the intersection at two different logics: first, energy policy is part of political contestation with some parties committed to increasing renewable energy and other parties denying the need for renewable energy. Second, as national governments commit themselves to renewable energy and climate targets, they require local governments to deliver their part. In 2020 the Dutch government launched the concept of Regional Energy Strategies where provinces and municipalities decide in a bottom-up fashion on their contribution to the national renewable energy target. Municipal councils have the last say on the construction of solar parks in their territory. We seek to determine to what extent the placement of solar parks is structured by Regional Energy Strategies or is driven by local party politics. We study the placement of solar parks in the Netherlands at the municipal level between 2015 and 2025. Regarding party politics, we expect that the stronger proponents of renewable energy are in the municipal council and executive, the more solar parks will be constructed. We position parties and executives using state of the state-of-art language modelling on manifestos and coalition agreements. Regarding energy governance structures we expect that the greater the national mandate for renewable energy production in a municipality is, the more solar parks will be constructed. The paper contributes to advancing the knowledge of the dynamics between national and local party politics and the ability of participatory governance structures to increase local cooperation with national goals.","Keywords: energy policy; environmental politics; local government; multilevel governance","Simon Otjes","Stefan Ćetković","Leiden University"," Simon Otjes","Leiden University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, do they look like men on observable background characteristics, such as education or prior occupation? Prior research focusing on women in lower-level politics show that female politicians face a premium, meaning that they need to compensate for discrimination by having higher qualifications than men. We investigate this phenomenon using the novel Paths to Power dataset, which provides detailed individual-level data on nearly 45,000 cabinet members across 137 countries from 1966 to 2021. We show that female ministers used to have better qualifications than men up to the 90ies but that the gap has decreased in later years. This finding might indicate a decreasing level of screening discrimination against women over time, meaning that women increasingly are seen as equal to men in politics even in the highest political positions.","Keywords: Comparative politics, gender, government, quantitative methods","Louisa Boulaziz, Jacob Nyrup","Louisa Boulaziz","University of Oslo"," Jacob Nyrup","University of Oslo","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although traditional research suggests that this can create additional political opportunities for marginalized groups, emerging work shows that political parties and elites pursue inclusivity strategically, expanding efforts only when electoral incentives align. We address these conflicting expectations by focusing on a critical but understudied area for political inclusion: campaign funding. Using a regression discontinuity design and data on candidate characteristics, electoral outcomes, and campaign finances from Brazilian municipal elections, we examine how the success of women and Afro-Brazilian candidates affects campaign resources in subsequent elections. Our findings shed light on whether and under what conditions the election of marginalized politicians leads political parties to pursue greater inclusivity, and how these efforts are shaped by electoral pressures. The electoral success of marginalized groups and the strategic calculations of political parties must both be considered to further political inclusion.","Keywords: marginalized groups; descriptive representation; campaign funding; Brazil","Iris Acquarone","Iris Acquarone","Arizona State University","Jamil Civitarese","New York University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arizona State University","New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While violent protests create economic uncertainty and political instability, we know little about how business elites respond to such events—most existing scholarship focuses on the impact of protests on political elites and public opinion. I argue that economically driven violent unrest creates fear and costs to business elites, who decide to coordinate through business associations and concede to rioters by increasing labor demand because they cannot rely on the state and fear future destruction and changes in the distribution of political power. I test this theory in Colombia and find that labor demand increases in municipalities exposed to violent protests, not among those exposed to nonviolent ones. Interviews with business elites and text analysis of business statements validate the theorized mechanism. Results suggest that economic elites are responsive to redistributive demands expressed through extra-electoral means.","Keywords: Business elites, protests, labor demand","Daniel Rojas","Daniel Rojas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of British Columbia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We address this question by studying the reform of the lottery-based committee appointment in the Dutch Tweede Kamer between 1868 and 1888. Previous accounts have linked the decline of similar procedures in late 19th century Europe to the rise of political parties. The argument we advance emphasizes the need for strengthening the informational role of committees as a key driver for the Dutch reform. We support our argument with evidence from three empirical analyses. First, using an original dataset of committee appointments in the 19th century Tweede Kamer, we show that the lottery-based appointment returned committees that tended to be unrepresentative of the political preferences of the full chamber. Second, based on an analysis of the legislative history of more than 400 government bills, we demonstrate that this lack of representativeness undermined committee specialization during legislative review. Third, in a qualitative analysis of floor speeches on reform proposals, we find that MPs explicitly sought more representative committee appointment as a means to facilitate specialization. Our analysis offers a novel contribution to comparative research on partisan and informational determinants of legislative institutional development.","Keywords: institutions, committees, lotteries, parties, Netherlands","Radoslaw Zubek","Radoslaw Zubek","University of Oxford","Twan van der Togt","Stack Data Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","Stack Data Strategy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0534_1747_0231.html","Bureaucracies and Trade Promotion","In an increasingly globalized world, governments are striving to support domestic firms in their pursuit of international markets. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) offer benefits such as reduced tariffs and harmonized standards, but they fall short in helping com- panies identify potential trade partners or providing practicable solutions for conflicts with these partners. This study explores how two bureaucracies – embassies led by ambassadors and export credit agencies (ECAs)– can assist companies in such scenar- ios. Ambassadors offer political connections, while ECAs provide financial instruments to mitigate risk. However, the interaction between these governmental efforts remains underexplored. Specifically, how do the political influence of ambassadors and the fi- nancial mechanisms of ECAs complement each other? We argue that these agencies may function synergistically, with one compensating for the other’s shortcomings. To test this hypothesis, we analyze novel data from two U.S. bureaucracies: the diplomatic corps and the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank. Our analysis of detailed deal-level data reveals that the EXIM Bank is more likely to approve support for private firms en- gaging in international trade when diplomatic influence declines. This paper enhances our understanding of the public sector’s role in facilitating private sector engagement in global markets.","Keywords: Ambassadors, Export Credit Agencies, Export-Import Bank, trade finance.","Jonas Bunte","Jonas Bunte","Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien"," Faisal Ahmed","Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0535_1768_1156.html","Whom Do Citizens Trust in Crises? The Influence of Speaker Characteristics in Governmental Crisis Communication","Trust in government is a key factor influencing the resilience of societies during crises. The literature on political crisis communication has so far predominantly focused on the role of the messages of governmental communication in shaping trust but it has neglected the role of messenger characteristics. This study addresses this shortcoming of the literature by shifting the focus from messages to messengers. It investigates how individual characteristics of communicators influence public trust during crises. To do so, it matches data on speakers present at government-held press conferences with social media discourse, examining how people reference these communicators online. Social media platforms serve as vital spaces where citizens communicate about their government’s crisis response and thus play an important role in building or undermining public trust. Given their role in shaping public perceptions of government performance, these digital platforms offer an ideal setting to observe how trust is built during crises. The study analyzes 744,000 posts on Twitter (now X) from six European countries during the early COVID-19 pandemic, employing multilingual transformer-based classification models to identify trust expressions and named entity recognition to associate tweets with individual speakers. The findings reveal that political actors generally face more distrust than experts, who tend to inspire greater trust. Gender dynamics also play a significant role, as female communicators tend to receive higher expressions of trust on social media during peak crisis periods. This suggests a “trust advantage” for female communicators, likely linked to relational communication traits valued in high-stress contexts.","Keywords: Political crisis communication, Public trust, Social media discourse","Christian Schwaderer","Christian Schwaderer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Innsbruck",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0536_2408_0347.html","Networks and Dynamics of Violent Political Mobilization: Historical Evidence from Spain","This paper explores the conditions under which citizens are mobilized for armed insurgency against democratic institutions. Our idea is that pre-conflict social and patronage networks play a crucial role in civilians' mobilization into militias, and that their influences can vary across different phases of the conflict, substituting or complementing coercion carried out with the capacity of the state. We investigate the drivers of fascist mobilization with extensive archival data from the Spanish Civil War in Navarre, a rural province pivotal for the 1936 pro-Franco insurgency. First, with municipal-level data, we show that electoral mobilization by conservative forces in the last, polarized democratic election held in 1936 predicts voluntary conscription in paramilitary militias in the early weeks of the war, when mobilization was left to the initiative of local elites. However, this pattern does not positively predict military recruitment in posterior, draft-based waves of mobilization, which coercively induced compliance in Republican-leaning areas. To observe the drivers of compliance at the individual level, we digitized the pre-war census of Navarre and matched it to records of pro-Franco combatants. Following the literature on electoral clientelism, we estimate pre-war family and occupational network ties between residents in rural villages using surnames and occupational information. Our individual-level findings indicate that network proximity to early promoters of the insurgency enhanced compliance with draft-based conscription among initial non-volunteers in left-wing communities. This study deepens our understanding of the social factors influencing civilians' decision to engage in conflict and their interaction with ideology and threat of retribution.","Keywords: Civil wars, Violent mobilization, Conscription, Ideology, Census data, Spain","Sergi Martínez","Sergi Martínez","EAFIT University","Giacomo Lemoli","IAST-TSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EAFIT University","IAST-TSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0537_2179_0566.html","The consequences of immigration and nativist resentment for national identity","An increasing body of research considers how national identification shapes individual attitudes to immigration. However, less explored is the reverse question of how exposure to immigration, and the corresponding views about non-native out-groups, affect individuals’ sense and strength of national identity. This paper focuses on this question, proposing two competing expectations. A backlash hypothesis predicts an increase in nationalistic attitudes in response to growing anti-immigrant sentiment and exposure to immigration, as natives identify more strongly with their in-group in contexts of increasing ethnic diversity. By contrast, the alternative hypothesis expects that, by potentially eroding social and political trust, increasing anti-immigrant sentiment and exposure to immigration could undermine national identification and attachment.The empirical strategy is two-fold. Relying on individual-level panel data from the British Election Study (BES) Internet Panel, the first study employs dynamic panel models to examine how changes in immigration attitudes affect respondents’ reported strength of British (and English) identity. Preliminary results suggest that attitudinal shifts in a pro-immigration direction foster stronger national identification, while shifts in an anti-immigration direction diminish it. The second empirical study seeks to further contribute to this question. By using time-series cross-sectional analyses coupled with an instrumental variable approach, it examines how rising shares of foreign-born population shape natives’ sense of national identity in a larger set of European countries. These analyses have important implications for our understanding of the complex relationship between immigration and nationalism in contemporary European democracies.","Keywords: Attitudes to immigration, National identification, Ethnic diversity","Alina Vranceanu","Alina Vranceanu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0538_2329_0437.html","Crime deterrent or downward spiral? Longitudinal evidence on the effects of lynchings on crime in Mexico, 2009-2022","Citizens across Latin America have reacted and mobilized collectively in diverse ways to resist and confront criminal violence and impunity, including taking justice in their own hands. The use of lynching stands out as a phenomenon through which victims and their communities attempt to capture and punish alleged criminals, who subsequently become victims of collective violence. Can lynching deter crime, or do they exacerbate it by further breaking down the rule of law? Large proportions of citizens across Latin America support lynchings and believe that they are effective in reducing crime, but to date there has been little research using causal inference methods to identify the effects of lynchings on crime at the local level. In this article, we attempt to fill that gap by analyzing a new time series dataset that combines novel data on lynching events coded from 47 Mexican news sources with existing survey and administrative data on crime, crime perceptions, and views of state authorities. We find that lynching events in Mexico are associated with short-term increases in property crime both in administrative records and in survey reports of crime victimization. These effects are concentrated in places where pre-lynching survey data shows low levels of community cohesion. These results are in line with a model in which lynchings are ineffective deterrents of crime and reduce the effectiveness of police responses to crime but are misperceived by citizens.","Keywords: criminal justice; Latin America; crime; misinformation; Mexico","Lauren Young","Lauren Young","UC Davis","Haley Daarstad","UC Davis","Hannah Baron","Tulane University","Sandra Ley","Tecnológico de Monterrey","","","","","","","","","","","","","UC Davis","Tulane University","Tecnológico de Monterrey",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0539_2217_0619.html","Fighting Corruption, Fighting Populism? Exploring the Effects of Changes in Government After Corruption Scandals","Corruption scandals have been considered one of the types of political crises that can lead to the rise of populism. The Manichean division of populism, in which the people are defined as pure and the elite as corrupt, as well as the anti-elitism, can be boosted by scandals in which the latter group is not only allegedly corrupt but factually. However, little is known about the effect of political responses to corruption scandals, especially when relating to populism. In 2018 the Spanish People’s Party was in government and was convicted of corruption. As a response, the main opposition party presented a no-confidence vote in Parliament, which overthrew the government. Taking advantage of the coincidence of those events with the data collection of a survey, I explore the effects of changes in government on populist attitudes using an experimental design. Do changes in government lead to the reduction of populism at the individual level? If so, is this effect present for both winners and losers of the change in government? Does institutional trust play a role in this relationship? This paper responds to these questions, showing the importance of institutional trust in reducing the demand for populism. Additionally, it speaks to the broader debate about the mechanisms liberal democracies have for responding to crises and palliating their effect on the rise of populism.","Keywords: populism, populist attitudes, experimental, UESD","Juan Pérez-Rajó","Juan Pérez-Rajó",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Why are some organisations more successful than others at securing benefits for their members? This paper addresses these questions by examining how informal workers’ organisations collectively impact the geographic distribution of income support benefits targeted at lower-income sectors.It argues that informal workers’ collective action shapes the distribution of social policy benefits at both the local level and, within districts, among organisations. Organisational density is the key factor explaining the distribution of benefits towards low-income groups, particularly when organisations are aligned with the governing party responsible for resource allocation. Organisations with greater mobilising capacity and larger structures are better positioned to negotiate with governments, thereby capturing a larger share of benefits. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that organisational mediation of policy benefits extends beyond those directly engaged in collective action, influencing social policy preferences and electoral outcomes at the local level.To support this argument, the paper draws on a diverse array of data sources, including a census of beneficiaries of a core workfare program in Argentina with unique individual-level information on over 90,000 beneficiaries, data on over 140 organisations, the national population census, precinct-level electoral results, and geo-localised survey data. Through quasi-experimental and observational analyses, the findings reveal the impact of organisational density on resource allocation both between and within districts, as well as the association of these patterns with electoral support for incumbents and social policy preferences.","Keywords: Social Policy, Informal Workers, Collective Action","Federico Fuchs","Federico Fuchs",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0541_2438_0746.html","Do stakeholder consultations enhance the quality of legislative anticipation for the European Commission?","The European Commission employs one of the most institutionalized and ambitious stakeholder engagement regimes. Designed as a tool for information gathering and preference aggregation, the EC’s stakeholder consultation regime constitutes an important part of its agenda-setting and policy formulation activities. It provides the Commission with an important informational advantage over its political masters, by allowing it to tap into policy and politically relevant information coming from stakeholders from across all Member States. Despite its frequent and intensive use, there is little systematic research about the extent to which stakeholder engagement helps the Commission improve the quality of its legislative anticipation, i.e., its ability to formulate policies that are minimally amended or changed by the EU co-legislators. Our study addresses this puzzle and elaborates a theoretical argument emphasizing the importance of two key mechanisms through which stakeholder engagement improves legislative anticipation: features of consultation design and patterns of stakeholder participation. We test our argument on a novel dataset containing information about 385 legislative proposals formulated and adopted between 2016-2021. Preliminary findings show that patterns of participation mater more than features of consultation design. The number of stakeholders engaged across all consultation activities is a strong predictor of the quality of legislative anticipation. Stakeholder diversity improves the quality legislative anticipation but only when the levels of stakeholder support for the proposal are high. The number of consultation activities improves the quality of legislative anticipation but only when considering the number of stakeholders participating at different policy formulation and consultation stages.","Keywords: European Commission, public consultations, quality of legislative anticipation, consultation design, stakeholder participation","Adriana Bunea","Adriana Bunea","University of Bergen"," Sergiu Lipcean","University of Bergen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Bergen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0542_2266_0812.html","Two dimensions in one? The meaning of experts’ left-right placements of parties","What is the issue content of experts’ placements of parties on the left-right dimension? The structure of the political space in Western democracies has changed substantially in past decades. New issues and the strategies of challenger parties have raised the salience of the socio-cultural dimension, and led to a relative decrease in the importance of the economic dimension. These changes also result in a more complex configurations of party positions – a development that underscores the multidimensionality of the political space. Most common is to represent that space as structured by two dimensions (economic and socio-cultural).Yet, despite this growing complexity, the left-right scale remains meaningful. It is a central heuristic to distinguish between party (and voter) positions, and there seems to be a shared understanding of that dimension. This is surprising, as the left-right dimension should not be sufficient to meaningfully summarize the positions of parties in a genuinely multidimensional space. As a solution to that paradox, this paper suggests that the left-right dimension is related in a non-linear manner to the underlying economic and socio-cultural dimensions: left-wing parties differ mainly in their economic positions, and right-wing parties on the cultural dimension. The one-dimensional left-right scale thus captures variation in two dimensions.The paper tests this hypothesis by analyzing how parties’ left-right positions, as assessed by experts, are associated with their issue-specific positions (combining data from various sources: CHES, CSES, GPS, CMP). Results show the expected non-linear pattern and invite us to rethink our interpretation of the left-right dimension.","Keywords: left-right dimension; party strategies; issue positions; experts","Romain Lachat","Romain Lachat",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0543_0102_0881.html","Who participates in UN Climate Negotiations?","Much negotiation research assumes that countries participate in multilateral negotiations to influence negotiation outcomes, and has sought to evaluate that influence over outcomes in different ways. Much less attention has been paid to participation itself, that is, how active countries are in negotiations. Yet, countries vary strongly in the extent to which they engage in multilateral processes, with some countries being highly vocal and visible, and others, rather passive and invisible. What explains this variation? Our dataset compiles data on participation in negotiations from COP1 in 1995 to COP28 in 2023. Using sources such as the Earth Negotiation Bulletin and UNFCCC records, we develop a participation index that tracks oral interventions, written submissions, leadership roles, and press briefings to measure engagement. We analyze this data with a time-series cross section model to explain how and why countries engage in negotiations. Theoretically, if states are rational and aim to influence outcomes, they would all seek active participation, but varying capacities may limit this. We hypothesize that resource constraints impact delegation size, affecting participation, with larger delegations typically playing more active roles. For smaller delegations, personal commitment of experienced negotiators can increase a country’s visibility. Thus, our second hypothesis links participation to delegation experience and continuity. By focusing on participation rather than negotiation size, our research sheds light on the dynamics that shape multilateral climate negotiations and their outcomes, and provides insights into the mechanisms that drive negotiation effectiveness and equity.","Keywords: UN Climate Negotiations, multilateralism, international negotiations","Paula Castro","Silvana Tarlea","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","Paula Castro","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","Carola Klock","Sciences Po","Sarah Tegas","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","Sciences Po",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding how these inequalities shape public preferences for climate policies is critical for ensuring the feasibility of effective climate action. While prior research offers competing evidence on the link between economic conditions and climate attitudes, this study shifts the focus to perceptions and beliefs about specific policies, which are among the strongest predictors of policy support.We study how differences in economic conditions at the individual and regional levels affect people’s perceptions of various climate policies and their support for them. Our analysis draws on novel data from a representative survey conducted across 13 EU countries, which we integrate with regional economic indicators. The survey assesses public perceptions of the cost and effectiveness of four climate policies, differentiated by sector and policy instrument type. Using a within-between random effects model, we disentangle the effects of individual income disparities and regional economic growth inequalities on these perceptions and their subsequent impact on policy support.By providing a better understanding of how economic conditions shape climate policy perceptions and support, our findings offer valuable insights into the political feasibility of climate action in the EU.

"abstract_0546_1969_1374.html","Public Support for Climate Policies: The Limited Impact of Benefits and the Weight of Costs","In addressing climate change, public opinion often supports the need for urgent and significant action, yet implementing climate policies remains challenging due to mixed public acceptance. This article examines how cost and benefit framings influence support for climate policies through an experimental design embedded in two surveys conducted in April and October 2024 (N=3,000) on representative samples of the Spanish population (up to 75 years old). We focus on 10 public policies related to climate change, assessing how exposure to either the costs or benefits of these policies shapes public support. Our results reveal that priming individuals with information about costs significantly reduces support for climate policies, regardless of the type of policy. In contrast, displaying the benefits associated with these policies has a limited effect: while small positive impacts are observed in some cases, most policies show null effects relative to the control group. These findings highlight the asymmetric influence of cost and benefit framings on public opinion, underscoring the challenges of gaining public endorsement for climate policies. They also suggest that emphasizing the benefits alone is insufficient to overcome resistance when costs are salient. By shedding light on the conditions under which climate policies gain or lose support, this study provides insights for policymakers aiming to design more effective communication strategies to enhance public acceptance of climate action.","Keywords: Climate policies, climate change, cost-benefit framing, survey experiment, Spain.","Marc Guinjoan","Marc Guinjoan","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Toni Rodon","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Joel Ardiaca","Universitat de Barcelona","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Universitat de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By bridging statistical inference and natural language processing, our work provides tools for inference on unstructured text data and connects to recent advances in text modeling and causal inference.","Keywords: Large Language Models, Causal Inference, Political Methodology","Marc Ratkovic","Marc Ratkovic","University of Mannheim"," Haoyu Zhai","University of Mannheim","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0548_1399_1015.html","From Rainbow Flags to Red Flags: How Attitudes Toward Gender Equality and Sexual Minorities Shape Voting Behavior","Post-industrial societies increasingly face conflicting forces that simultaneously advance and resist gender equality. While policy efforts have advanced women’s and sexual minorities’ rights, a reactionary discourse has gained traction in Europe, often framed as a “war on gender ideology”. As conservative and far-right actors strategically politicize these issues, societal attitudes become a critical battleground of competing ideological narratives. While research has extensively explored the role of sexism in shaping voting behavior, comparatively less attention has been paid to the influence of attitudes toward sexual minorities. Notably, it remains unclear how social groups combine support for women and sexual minority rights and how polarized these attitudes are, reflecting a potential attitudinal divide. To addresses this gap, this study poses two key questions: (1) To what extent do attitudes toward women and sexual minority rights differ in their degree of polarization? (2) How do these attitudes shape voting behavior, and are there discernible differences in their influence? Using original survey data collected in ten European countries, this paper explores the similarities and differences in attitudes towards women and sexual minorities and links both to voting behavior. As such, this study enhances the literature theoretically and empirically by establishing a link between attitudes on the two issues, and by providing a deeper understanding of how divides over gender and sexuality intersect with political preferences, shedding light on the factors shaping electoral behavior in contemporary democracies.","Keywords: gender, sexual minorities, voting behavior, gender backlash, polarization,","Melanie Dietz","Melanie Dietz","Research Institut Social Cohesion - Goethe University Frankfurt am Main","Cyrill Otteni","Mercator Forum for Migration and Democracy (Forum MIDEM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Research Institut Social Cohesion - Goethe University Frankfurt am Main","Mercator Forum for Migration and Democracy (Forum MIDEM)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a lack of analysis regarding the link between satisfaction with democracy and modern sexism. In an era where gender equality remains a contentious issue, this study tests whether individuals exhibiting stronger sexist attitudes are less likely to be satisfied with a democracy that has advanced women’s rights in recent years. Using original panel data collected online in Spain in two waves in 2023, we find a general negative association between modern sexism and satisfaction with democracy. Our results are robust across different model specifications, including variations before and after elections and across political parties (both winners and losers of the 2023 Spanish General Election).","Keywords: Satisfaction with Democracy, Modern Sexism, Panel Survey, Spain","Isabel Inguanzo, Araceli Mateos","Isabel Inguanzo","University of Salamanca"," Araceli Mateos","University of Salamanca","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Salamanca",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet we know little about the origins and effectiveness of internal control units, particularly in subnational governments of the global south. This paper analyzes the case of Brazilian municipalities’ internal control systems, using administrative data and quasi-experimental designs to examine the drivers and consequences of control. Using cross-sectional data, I document that there remains significant variation in the resources, mandates, and actions of internal control systems. Second, I use panel data and a causal event study design to show that legal reforms of internal control systems lead to an increase in hires of internal controllers. Third, I show these legal reforms have downstream consequences in the control of patronage, leading to a reduction in the size of the municipal workforce, and a higher incidence of civil service contracts. Fourth, I show that randomized federal anti-corruption audits have significant effects on municipal control systems. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of local internal control institutions and call for further research on the causes and consequences of their strength.","Keywords: corruption, governance, local governments, control, audits","Guillermo Toral","Guillermo Toral",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"IE University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We comprehensively examine the gender gap in mass public opinion in Western democracies over time using a new and extensive dataset (~6.5 million observations) of issue attitudes and issue salience over 50 years, across 23 issues in 14 countries. Contrary to common beliefs and a lively public debate about a growing gender gap in central policy areas, we find no evidence of an increasing gender gap over time and no substantial differences in issue positions between men and women. Instead, we ask whether the gender gap arises as men and women differ in how important they find different policy areas (issue salience), but we neither find substantial differences in the salience men and women assign to important policy issues, nor a trend towards an increasing gender gap in issue salience.","Keywords: Gender gap, public opinion, citizen attitudes, issue salience","Merete Bech Seeberg","Merete Bech Seeberg","Aarhus University"," Henrik Bech Seeberg","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0552_2043_0111.html","When do cleavages matter for democracy perceptions? An analysis of old, new and subjective divides","Several empirical studies have connected rising anti-democratic attitudes with societal conflicts. These conflicts are categorized through a multitude of conflict lines, such as old cleavages (like class), new cleavages (like globalization support), or subjective perception of status loss (like societal recognition). Throughout these studies, anti-democratic attitudes are often linked to the so-called “losers” of globalization who are categorized as disadvantaged and left behind. However, these different conflict lines have rarely been brought together in a more encompassing understanding of what drives democratic alienation. This paper employs latent class analysis to identify profiles of globalization winners and losers by combining variables based on old, new and subjective divides in Germany and the US. It finds both the existence of stereotypical “losers” (i.e. globalization opponents with low incomes who feel deprived), but also more complex combinations (such as affluent individuals who feel subjectively deprived and oppose globalization despite their being well off). Regression analyses connect these profiles to democratic preferences to analyze which combinations actually fuel anti-democratic sentiment, and which merely prefer democratic alternatives to the status quo. It goes beyond basic political attitudes and investigates how this translates to support for right-wing parties or candidates (e.g. Trump and the AfD respectively), a connection that is frequently assumed to exist among globaliazation losers.","Keywords: political preferences, cleavages, globalization, inequality","Franziska Maier, Vanessa Schwaiger","Franziska Maier","University of Stuttgart","Vanessa Schwaiger","University of Stuttgart","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stuttgart","University of Stuttgart",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The accuracy of voter lists -– the extent to which all eligible adults are enrolled to vote and all ineligible individuals are deleted from the list -– therefore is an indicator of the health of a democracy. While under-enrollment and the extent of “deadwood” on voter lists have come under considerable scrutiny in the United States, the accuracy of electoral rolls in developing countries has not attracted the same scholarly attention so far. I examine the quality of the electoral roll in India, the world’s largest democracy, using original data from two full village censuses and a large-scale voter survey. I find that voter lists simultaneously show under-enrollment – that is the disenfranchisement of eligible adults – as well as deadwood; and that the deadwood masks part of the under-enrollment. This pattern is starkest for women, particularly young women, who are most likely to migrate in India and often dependent on family support for their voter registration. The reason for the poor quality of voter lists, I argue, lies in the incentive structure for low-level officers in charge of maintaining the decentralized rolls.","Keywords: Political Participation, Gender, India, Voting, Voter Registration","Franziska Roscher","Franziska Roscher",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Georgia Institute of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The vast majority of contributions to this literature examine a single historical event and estimate its impact on a specific dimension of societal organization. Some other papers go one step further by suggesting conditionality of the impact of historical events on other preexisting factors. But could sequences of multiple, distinct historical events interact in complex ways in shaping contemporary legacies? In this paper, we focus on present-day Romania, which was historically subject to both foreign rule and authoritarianism. Theoretically, these historical events could constitute distinct, independent legacies or they could interact in shaping contemporary aspects of social organization. We present a variety of theoretical perspectives on how legacies may interact and test them through a combination of an original survey of local state institutions.","Keywords: Legacy and persistence studies, Eastern Europe, historical authoritarianism, communism, imperialism.","Jan P.

We study the monthly lotteries used to exhaustively assign legislators to smaller preparatory committees in 19th century Belgium. We focus on the period of democratization following universal, male and plural suffrage, which had allowed a substantial number of new, third-party Socialists to enter. We ask whether random group composition, or more extensive exposure to certain types of members, affected voting over the universe of more than five-hundred roll-call votes between 1897 and 1902. We consider for example the effect of debating more Socialists, more politically experienced incumbents, or more representatives of majority Flemish- vs. French-speaking districts. We find small but significant exposure effects on rebelling against the party majority, in unexpected directions. We further illustrate the relevance of the political lottery for some measures which passed only after attracting cross-partisan support, including on the PR electoral system for national elections, a first in 1899.","Keywords: Roll-call voting, legislative committees, political lotteries, democratization, party cohesion","Jessica De Rongé","Brenda Van Coppenolle","Sciences Po","Sofija Riegger","Sciences Po; Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Jessica De Rongé","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po","Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies have shown a positive link between political trust and support for free trade and liberalism. This paper examines the effectiveness of trade adjustment assistance programs in increasing political trust. We compare the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in the European Union (EU), with the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program in the United States, the former of which mimics the TAA but primarily targets compensation at the firm rather than the individual level. We argue that trade adjustment assistance programs are more effective at improving political trust when assistance is not politically influenced. Leveraging survey data from EU28 countries and the US combined with geolocated data on trade adjustment assistance, we find that people in EU regions receiving assistance tend to trust the EU more. Conversely, we find no effect on political trust in TAA-compensated US regions. Addressing causality we leverage a staggered difference-in-differences design with new panel data at the municipality level from Denmark. We find that trade adjustment assistance is increasing preferences for the EU in the short to medium term. Our findings suggest that political trust can serve as an alternative measure of trade policy effectiveness.","Keywords: International Trade, United States, European Union, Liberalism, Political Trust","Søren Etzerodt","Ye June Jung","University of California, San Diego","Rachel Yu","University of California, San Diego","Søren Etzerodt","Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Diego","Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0557_1795_1155.html","A Web of Hate? Online hate comments and gendered political participation","Studies show persistent gender differences in the extent to which citizens engage in politics online. In order to explain these findings we argue that aspects of engagement unique to the online sphere must be better measured and understood. Research shows that online violence such as hate speech does not only affect those who it targets but everyone who sees it. This makes it a powerful tool to silence specific groups online. Women are among those groups most heavily targeted by online hate speech and gendered socialization experiences cause women to avoid especially visible or confrontative participation activities. Thus, we suggest that a hostile atmosphere on the internet, especially in the shape of hateful comments, may be a crucial factor for understanding the gendered character of political online discourse. While online hate may have a negative effect on women’s propensity to engage online, it may under specific circumstances also mobilize them to show solidarity and to engage, despite the fear of being targeted by hateful comments. Given how the causal relationship between online hate and women’s engagement is not established yet, we employ a pre-registered 2 x 2 between subject vignette experiment in a computer-assisted RDD telephone interview survey in a probability sample (n = 2,200) to explore the circumstances under which women’s online engagement might be sparked or demobilized. Our findings highlight how novel forms of gendered violence in the shape of hate comments impact women’s (and men’s) lives and behaviors and have the potential to exacerbate already existing inequalities.","Keywords: Gender, online political participation, hate speech, vignette experiment","Katharina Heger","Katharina Heger","Weizenbaum Institute","Hilde Coffé","University of Bath","Catherine Bolzendahl","Oregon State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Weizenbaum Institute","University of Bath","Oregon State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This question is pressing given the global decline of democracy, despite many countries’ long experience with multiparty elections. Early optimism about the role of elections in fostering democratic norms and institutions following the third wave of democratization has since been challenged by scholars who argue that elections can also reinforce authoritarian rule. Drawing on insights from the study of electoral violence, I investigate an important caveat to the democratization-by-elections theory by examining whether the association between repeated multiparty elections and democratization depends on whether the elections are peaceful or violent. The findings indicate that while peaceful elections may contribute to greater liberal democracy, violent elections do not. The empirical analysis, moreover, assesses evidence for the mechanisms linking peaceful elections to higher levels of democratization. It provides supportive evidence for intraparty democracy and civil society participation as mediating variables linking elections to democratization, but not for electoral participation. Repeated violent elections, on the other hand, are associated with declining electoral turnout, suggesting that the negative effects of violence compound over time. The findings suggest that democracy promotion must prioritize efforts to constrain electoral violence. They also encourage further research into the causal linkages between violence and stalled democratization, as well as between peaceful elections and democratic progress.","Keywords: Democratization, electoral violence, turnout, intraparty democracy, civil society participation","Gudlaug Olafsdottir","Gudlaug Olafsdottir",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Uppsala UniversityStockholm University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Focusing on the introduction and removal of international borders between 1815 and 1938, this paper investigates how border change affected the ethnonational geography of Europe. We argue that in periods of nation-building, individuals subjected to a change in ruling state are incentivized to assimilate into the conquering state. Using highly disaggregated proxies of national identity and the spatial discontinuities in ruling state caused by the introduction and removal of borders, we show that ethnolinguistic identities converge when under the same state and diverge when exposed to different states' rule. Assimilation, migration and nation-building policy drive these results.

Utilizing a supervised machine learning technique, I classify protesters as ""left"", ""center left"", ""unknown"", ""center right"", and ""right"", enabling a nuanced analysis of ideological variations. Algorithmically identifying sequences of ideologically similar protests within close temporal and geographic proximity, I create matched protest pairs to isolate how police response to partisanship changes over time. This matched wake analysis spans a six-year period between 2018 and 2024, examining both immediate aftermath effects (1-7 days) and long-term patterns up to 30 days following significant events (Schutte and Donnay, 2014). The research critically assesses whether there is an increasing police presence and/or escalatory police response associated with protestor partisanship across these three countries.

However, the extent to which legislators align with interest groups interventions has received less attention. This paper contributes both theoretically and empirically to the analysis of interest group interactions with legislators by measuring the degree of alignment between them during parliamentary hearings. Specifically, we examine the extent to which legislators' responses to interest group appearances are aligned, thus converge in their viewpoints, arguments, and justifications concerning a particular issue or policy. Alignment is operationalized as semantic similarity, using phrase embeddings for an original dataset on hearings in the Spanish parliament between 1993 and 2023. This analytical approach offers a nuanced perspective that complements extant evidence derived from text analysis on lobbying reports, executive consultations, press releases, parliamentary debates and social media data in a longitudinal perspective. After controlling for several confounding variables, our results show that the type of group and the policy making activity under discussion shapes the alignment among interest groups and parliamentary groups.

Moving scholarly attention beyond the left-right dimension, I study party responsiveness across a heterogeneous selection of six key issue areas, including many of the most salient issues in contemporary European politics. In addition, I integrate recent conceptual advances to study whether parties shift in the same direction as voters and whether these shifts help to reduce party-voter incongruencies. Combining expert survey and election study data, I examine the dynamic linkages between voter preferences and party positions in 220 parties across 28 European countries between 1999 and 2019. I find only limited evidence that parties are responsive to the mean voter. In contrast, I find strong patterns of party responsiveness to supporters across issues. Parties not only tend to shift their positions in the same direction as their supporters, but these shifts also tend to reduce incongruencies. The patterns prove consistent across mainstream and niche parties and the entire EU. The findings carry important implications for our understanding of representation in contemporary European politics.","Keywords: Political parties, representation, responsiveness, congruence, issue competition","Felix Lehmann","Felix Lehmann",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg, Department of Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This depiction of feminized climate victimhood across the Global South is problematic because it distorts the reality of women's varied responses and denies their agency in responding to climate issues. While such portrayals of feminized victimhood have become pervasive in social media, mainstream news, and governmental reports, the actual impact of these gender-specific narratives on those who consume them has been under-explored, particularly as countries in the Global North are increasingly called upon to finance climate adaption in the Global South. We investigate the impact of these images/narratives through survey experiments conducted in both the Global North (France) and the Global South (Côte d'Ivoire). We assess how such imagery and discourse affect (1) public support for providing climate financing to the Global South among Global North citizens and (2) political efficacy among Global South citizens in the context of climate action. We hypothesize that portrayals of feminized victimhood may simultaneously increase support for climate financing among Global North citizens, while depressing the political efficacy of Global South citizens.","Keywords: foreign aid, humanitarian, NGOs, repression","Allison Grossman","Allison Grossman",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Tulane University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior research has highlighted descriptive youth underrepresentation and assumed that younger MPs are better suited for substantive youth representation, yet this claim remains empirically untested. To address this, I developed a methodological framework that enables to analyse a twenty-year span of parliamentary speeches across two countries. First, I hand-annotated 2,000 parliamentary speeches to create a high-quality multilingual training dataset. Using this dataset, I fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual Transformer-based model, to construct a supervised multi-class classifier capable of automatically identifying youth-specific content in speeches. This classifier was applied to approximately 1.6 million speeches from the UK and Germany spanning two decades, providing comprehensive and reliable information on MPs' substantive youth representation. This methodological approach enables a fine-grained and systematic analysis of youth representation across vast multilingual corpora and different political systems. Results show that younger MPs are significantly more likely to represent youth interests in their speeches, validating the hypothesis that descriptive representation influences substantive representation. By employing cutting-edge NLP techniques in a multilingual context, this research advances the study of substantive representation in political science, demonstrating the value of text-as-data methods for analysing political discourse and group representation. These findings underscore the broader implications of linking descriptive and substantive representation, while highlighting the benefits of NLP in studying political discourse.","Keywords: NLP, Text-as-data, Supervised Learning, Parliamentary Speeches, Group Representation","Robin Rentrop","Robin Rentrop",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Göttingen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0569_1523_1011.html","The politics of language. The consequences of banning gender-inclusive language in Germany.","Despite widespread support for gender equality, public opinion on measures addressing existing inequalities has increasingly become polarized. In Germany, the debate around gender-inclusive language (GIL) exemplifies this divide. GIL refers to person nouns that refer to women and men, or all genders (e.g., Wähler*innen or Wählerinnen und Wähler to refer to voters). The use of GIL surged from 2018 to 2021, and whilst adoption has since steadied, the controversies it has sparked continue. While proponents of GIL regard it as a tool to improve gender equality, not everyone sees the move towards GIL favourably. In 2024, the state of Bavaria gained widespread media attention for implementing a “Genderverbot” (ban on using GIL). Following this ban, civil servants in Bavarian public institutions may not use most types of GIL. We investigate the attitudinal and behavioural consequences of this ban.We expect two potential outcomes. As intended, the ban may reinforce traditional norms, reducing the use of GIL and fostering more conservative gender attitudes. By contrast, intervening in language use could be seen as an intrusion on free speech and thus bolster support for GIL use and even increase attitudes towards gender equality.  Using computational text analysis on a corpus of newspaper comments, we analyse whether banning GIL affected its use. Moreover, survey data allow us to study whether the ban has affected attitudes towards gender equality. In doing so, we examine the consequences of regulating a polarized topic, including potential unintended consequences.","Keywords: gender-inclusive language, gender attitudes, polarization","Mirko Wegemann","Anica Waldendorf","University of Oxford","Mirko Wegemann","University of Münster","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","University of Münster",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This phenomenon, conceptualised as ‘gender backlash’, has been particularly channelled by radical right-wing parties.This research aims to examine the interconnections between political distrust and attitudinal orientations related to citizens’ gender backlash and their impact on political preferences. We hypothesize that anti-gender attitudes are associated with political distrust. This political distrust is perhaps caused by relative deprivation which conservative individuals (men and women) experience, given the last decades of progress on gender rights. We further hypothesize that this interaction between political distrust and anti-gender attitudes has different effects on support for different party families.We rely on data from an original survey developed by the UNTWIST project (Policy recommendations to regain ‘losers of feminism’ as mainstream voters. https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101060836 ) in six European countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Spain, and the UK).","Keywords: political distrust, gender backlash, radical right, voting behaviour","Daniel Romero Portillo, Mariana Sendra, Pablo Ortiz Barquero","Daniel Romero Portillo","Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Sevilla, España)","Mariana Sendra","Universidad de Deusto (Bilbao, España)","Pablo Ortiz Barquero","Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Sevilla, España)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Sevilla, España)","Universidad de Deusto (Bilbao, España)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0571_2041_1012.html","Culture wars and the symbolic representation of the rights of women, LGBTIQ+, future generations and migrants.","The policy fields of (1) equality between men and women, (2) LGBTIQ+ people, (3) climate change mitigation and environmental protection and (4) immigration and the management of ethnic and racial diversity are at the centre of the political divides that sort both the public and political parties along ‘new’ dimensions of emerging transnational and cultural cleavages. Often, these political divides are expressed through 'culture wars', mobilising identities and symbols. Indeed, in several EU countries, the flags that symbolize women's rights, LGBTIQ+ rights, migrants/refugees' rights and climate activism have been the subject of contestation, especially when displayed in public buildings.In this paper, we examine how these divides are expressed by ordinary citizens when evaluating the symbolic representation that elected local and national assemblies can choose to exercise by taking sides on these issues by displaying such flags on the façade of a public building. Using a survey of 13,000 respondents in 10 EU countries, we examine novel data on the cross-national awareness of the meaning of the four flags, as well as the views citizens have of the appropriateness of symbolically representing such causes. We focus on polarization around such symbolic representation and its connection to polarization around the underlying political divides.","Keywords: Gender equality, LGBTIQ+, climate change, immigration, polarization.","Laura Morales","Laura Morales",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"IPP, CSIC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0572_1647_0051.html","Greening in Groups: Firm Concentration and Lobbying on Green Industrial Policy","Green industrial policy is an increasingly common tool for states seeking to reach mid-century decarbonization targets. Whereas existing explanations of firm climate preferences largely focus on regulation, explanations for assistance lie at the sector level. I argue that a firm’s geographic concentration, by increasing the potential proximate benefits that a firm can accrue following expansions to the green assistance budget, increases the likelihood a firm directly lobbies on green industrial policy. Assistance budget expansions make feasible transformational decarbonization projects, large enough to spillover to multiple firms in a given area, hence those firms that are most concentrated to other firms stand to gain the most. Using French lobbying data, I assess how manufacturing firms responded to the expansion of green assistance as a part of the COVID-19 stimulus policy: France Relance. Using this exogenous funding shock in a difference-in-differences design, I find that more concentrated firms increasingly lobby on green industrial policy. This finding holds when I consider intra-industry heterogeneity in concentration with more concentrated firms increasingly lobbying alone. Interviews, fieldwork and secondary source materials corroborate the focus on geographically proximate benefits in the years since France Relance. These results suggest that firm behavior towards green assistance is structured by a geographic rather than based on sector- or emissions intensity-based cleavages.","Keywords: Green Industrial Policy, Climate Change, Firms, Intra-Industry Cleavage","Ryan Pike","Ryan Pike",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0573_0687_0116.html","The Urban-Rural Divide in Our Heads: Misperceptions and Place-Based Affective Polarization","Several recent studies have documented a pronounced degree of affective polarization between residents of urban and rural areas. Similar to affective polarization between partisans, both urbanites and ruralites tend to exhibit a bias towards their place-based in-group. How these biases arise, however, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we argue that place-based affective polarization is rooted in misperceptions of what constitutes the political allegiances of typical urbanites and ruralites. We test this proposition by means of three studies. In Study 1, we measure misperceptions of voting behavior along the urban-rural divide, relying on survey items asking respondents to guess the percentage of urban and rural residents voting for a given party. In Study 2, we then investigate the association between misperceptions and place-based affective polarization in an observational setting. Lastly, Study 3 investigates the causal effect of misperceptions on place-based affective polarization in an experiment.","Keywords: urban-rural divide; affective polarisation; voting behaviour; place-based identity","Sven Hegewald","Sven Hegewald","ETH Zurich","Dominik Schraff","Aalborg University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","Aalborg University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0574_0134_0147.html","Musical Chairs: The Causes and Effects of Frequent Judicial Transfers in India","In many developing countries, the executive controls judicial assignments. Under conditions of strong accountability, we hypothesize that this can lead to frequent transfers of judges. Transfers can cause judge vacancies and increase the hearings needed to resolve cases. For both reasons, cases that experience transfers are less likely to be resolved in a time-bound manner. We test our theory by leveraging detailed microdata from Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state.  An analysis of the resumes of over 3000 judges in the state’s lower judiciary confirms that transfers are indeed frequent: judges are typically transferred across positions every 11 months, and across districts every three years.Transfers have large ramifications on the judicial system. An analysis of the progression of over 10 million cases filed between 2010 and 2018 suggests that transfers decrease judge productivity, as measured by the number of decisions issued. Cases that experience transfers are less likely to be decided quickly. Consistent with the theory, these cases are also more likely to be temporarily “orphaned” due to court vacancies and experience more hearings.Around transfers, judges are more likely to resolve recently filed and relatively easy cases. Rules and planning can limit the costs of transfers. Bail cases—which must be decided quickly—are less likely to be affected by transfers, and transfers that occur at regularly scheduled times are less detrimental to court productivity. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications.","Keywords: comparative political institutions, law and courts, South Asia and India, public policy","Rikhil Bhavnani","Rikhil Bhavnani","University of Wisconsin-Madison"," Saloni Bhogale","University of Wisconsin-Madison"," Amit Jadhav","University of Wisconsin-Madison","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Wisconsin-Madison",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0575_0490_0206.html","Agrarian Inequality and Long-Run Development: Evidence from Pakistan [PESA]","What are the political and economic effects of inequality in the distribution of land? Two different theoretical mechanisms suggest themselves. On the one hand, a more unequal rural society may see higher levels of social conflict (as the poor seek to redistribute land) and lower levels of public goods provision (as the rich sabotage public provision and substitute with private goods). On the other hand, a more unequal society with larger farms may be better positioned to invest in new technology and benefit from economies of scale. We examine this question in the context of colonial Punjab, where the colonial regime irrigated and distributed large areas of previously uncultivated arid land. We exploit changes in the formulae for land allocation which lead to more or less egalitarian distributions of land in individual villages. Preliminary results from a small subset of villages indicate that inequality is associated with higher levels of tenancy in the colonial period. In the 21st century, colonial inequality is associated with lower levels of public goods provision, with no effect on private goods provision.","Keywords: Economic inequality, colonialism, agricultural economics, Pakistan, irrigation","Alexander Lee","Alexander Lee","University of Rochester","Noaman Ali","University of Bath","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Rochester","University of Bath",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Protests are usually classified as peaceful or violent based on the most salient form of participants’ behaviour. However, we do not know much about what else happens within protest events that may eventually lead to the appearance of violent tactics. We present a spectrum of violent tactics that participants can use to show dissent against the government. We argue that while some protests display a consistent preference for peaceful or violent resistance from the outset, others show diversity in their behaviour, adding uncertainty to their overall outcome. Harnessing a new image-to-data methodology, we analyze 15,567 protest images across 10 countries between 2016 and 2021. In doing so, we provide two contributions to the field of organized dissent. First, we explain how within protest violence can be identified using the composition of particular objects. We do so by leveraging the information of over 8.1 million objects detected on the protest images using the Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (LVIS) dataset. Second, we extract and classify image-specific features on a diverse pool of participant behaviour over our entire sample, allowing us to recognize violent events using images. Overall, this new data collection effort and analysis help us gain insights into the inner workings of protest events.","Keywords: Image analysis, protests, violence detection, tactics.","Alejandro Aísa","Alejandro Aísa","University of Konstanz","Belén González","University of Konstanz; University of Zurich","Stefan Scholz","University of Konstanz","Christian von Soest","German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA)","Nils B.

"abstract_0577_0788_0289.html","No Taxation Without Representation: Inequality and Responsiveness in Modern Tax Policy (PETAX)","Taxation has long been central to political conflict, encapsulated by the rallying cry of “no taxation without representation.” Yet, in today’s advanced democracies, how well do tax policies reflect public preferences, particularly in an era of stark economic inequality? This paper addresses a critical but underexplored question: to what extent do modern tax systems represent the preferences of citizens across income groups? Using a novel cross-national analysis of top marginal income tax rates in 20 democracies since the 1980s, this study reveals that tax policy aligns most closely with middle-class preferences, contrary to conventional narratives of elite dominance. However, it also uncovers significant informational asymmetries that skew the responsiveness of policies. Wealthier individuals, better equipped to understand complex tax policies, have preferences that adapt more dynamically to policy changes. In contrast, the less informed, often lower-income groups, are systematically underrepresented in tax outcomes. A deeper dive into tax schedules in the United States and the United Kingdom underscores the pivotal role of the middle class in shaping tax policies, while also spotlighting stark deviations in areas like capital gains taxation. These findings challenge prevailing theories about elite control, highlighting the nuanced dynamics of political representation in fiscal policymaking. By illuminating how inequality and public opinion interact in the realm of taxation, this paper contributes to our understanding of democratic responsiveness in the modern era. It offers critical insights into the mechanisms by which governments balance representation, fairness, and economic efficiency in tax policy design.","Keywords: taxation; representation; inequality; public preferences","Mads Andreas Elkjær","Mads Andreas Elkjær",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While SEZs are often viewed as vehicles for foreign investment and regional growth, the strategic motives driving their establishment remain underexplored. This study fills a critical gap by investigating the political and fiscal determinants of SEZ creation, hypothesizing that greater fiscal decentralization significantly boosts the likelihood of SEZ establishment. When local governments receive a larger share of central revenue, regional leaders gain incentives to champion SEZs, seeing them as levers to enhance local economic power and growth. By analyzing SEZs through a political economy lens, this research reveals how decentralization policies and intergovernmental dynamics shape the motivations for SEZ creation. It underscores the complex intra-country relationships that influence regional development strategies, showing how local governance decisions intersect with national economic goals to drive place-based economic policies, particularly in the development of SEZs.","Keywords: Political Economy, Special Economic Zones, Fiscal Decentralization, Place-based policy","Dewa Gede Sidan Raeskyesa","Dewa Gede Sidan Raeskyesa",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute for International Political Economy, WU Vienna University of Economics and Business",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Researchers have typically evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions based on a simple discernment measure, i.e., the difference between true and false news ratings. These measures have been shown to be problematic, as they conflate sensitivity with response bias. Here, we will re-assess the findings of this literature by analyzing their data using a Signal Detection Theory (SDT) framework. This will allow us to differentiate between two different kinds of intervention effects. First, the effect on sensitivity, which is the (true) ability to discriminate between true and false news. Second, the effect on response bias, i.e., the extent to which participants generally become more or less skeptical in their accuracy ratings, such as rating all news as false. We will also test potential moderators of these effects, such as the political concordance of the headlines. We will run an Individual Participant Data meta-analysis (IPD) based on a sample of studies that we identified via a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. We use a two-stage approach: First, we extract individual participant data and run a Signal Detection Theory analysis separately for each experiment. Second, we run a meta-analysis on the experiment-level outcomes. We have already pre-registered the meta-analysis and conducted the systematic literature review. Our findings will provide methodological insights to improve these interventions as well as practical recommendations on which intervention works best and for whom.","Keywords: Misinformation; News; Interventions; Meta-analysis; Discernment","Sacha Altay, Jan Pfänder","Sacha Altay","University of Zurich","Jan Pfänder","ENS, Institut Jean Nicod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zurich","ENS, Institut Jean Nicod",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The rationale for this research stems from a lack of consensus in the academic debate on the implications of affective polarization for democracy, driven by limited empirical evidence and the understudied European multi-party context. The central research question is: 'How does affective polarization influence electoral winners' and losers' satisfaction with democracy?' The main hypothesis is that increased affective polarization amplifies dissatisfaction with democracy among losers and satisfaction among winners. This research utilizes logistic regression analysis with interaction terms across 33 elections in 25 European countries, drawing on individual-level data from 32,340 respondents collected between 2016 and 2021 through the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Module 5. This study expands the scope of previous research by employing cross-national analysis.The study reveals a significant finding: greater affective polarization leads to a widening gap in satisfaction with democracy between winners and losers. This widening gap was particularly evident in countries like Türkiye, Hungary, Montenegro, Poland, Lithuania, France, Germany, Greece, and the UK. However, the relationship is not uniform across all cases. Notably, a few outliers were observed, where losers expressed higher satisfaction with democracy than winners—reflecting the complex political dynamics in Europe, where coalition-building with ideologically diverse parties sometimes occurs. These findings contribute to the academic debate by emphasizing the dangers of affective polarization for democratic stability, which is increasingly relevant in light of rising polarization and democratic backslides across European nations.","Keywords: Affective polarization, Europe, Democracy, Quantitative","Yurii Kondratyk","Yurii Kondratyk",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Tartu",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent work explores how state violence affects the likelihood for demand escalation - the process by which initial reformist protests adopt maximalist demands, calling for regime change (Kang, 2023). These first inquiries into the emergence of maximalist protest from ongoing protest mobilization rely on aggregate-level campaign data to assess the effect of repression on demand escalation. Asking How does repression affect the likelihood of demand escalation within a protest episode, this study complements existing work by studying demand escalation on event-level data in authoritarian regimes. Doing so provides a more precise temporal assessment of the link between repression and protests demands, critical for understanding an escalation process over time. Leveraging newly constructed data on maximalist demands per protest event, this paper examines how repression of prior reformist protests affects subsequent demand escalation during a series of protest events within the same city. Initial results highlight how political violence against reformist protest events is not significantly associated with demand escalation at later protests. This would suggest a potentially more nuanced relationship between repression and demand escalation than what previous campaign-level analysis has implied. Given the potential consequences of maximalist protest campaigns, especially in authoritarian regimes, further probing into the temporal sequencing between state action and reformist protest turning maximalist is warranted.","Keywords: Contentious Politics; Political Violence; Protests; Repression; Social Movements","Jan Rustemeyer","Jan Rustemeyer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To test our central hypothesis, we leverage variation in the informational resources of state legislatures across units and over time and compare these resource endowments to intergovernmental transfer, finding that better resourced legislatures—who presumably face smaller informational asymmetries to substate agencies—appropriate significantly smaller intergovernmental transfers, all else equal.

"abstract_0583_1735_0567.html","Ancestral institutions and Participation in Interventions for Children's Welfare among Immigrants in Sweden","The ability of states to implement policy relies on citizens' readiness to voluntarily comply with state decrees. This willingness likely depends on citizens' prior experiences of state-citizen relations. However, we cannot assume that all citizens have identical experiences with the state. In recent years, Sweden, a state that relies on voluntary compliance, has experienced a large influx of immigrants from states where the exercise of power is based on violence and coercion. The interaction between these ancestral and present state-citizen relationships remains an unexplored but crucial question for the welfare of these individuals and the functioning of the state.Using Swedish administrative data, we explore whether immigrants' ancestral institutions – defined as state capacity of their country of origin – explain compliance in their new home country, operationalized as participation in three different interventions for children's welfare: the National Child Health Services Program (CHS), and interventions by social services in accordance with the Social Services Act (SoL) and The Care of Young Persons Act (LVU). The CHS provides an example of voluntary compliance, characterized by high levels of participation and tangible direct benefits. Voluntary care of children in accordance with SoL is an intermediary case, still non-mandatory and motivated by the child's best interest, but associated with stigma and a perceived risk for the parents, like subsequent loss of custody. LVU is a prime example of coercive state power, as it is devised for use in cases of non-compliance. This allows for comparing rates of voluntary, quasi-voluntary, and, non-voluntary compliance.","Keywords: immigration, state capacity, compliance, Sweden, administrative data","Rasmus Broms","Rasmus Broms","University of Gothenburg"," Agnes Cornell","University of Gothenburg"," Andrej Kokkonen","University of Gothenburg"," Mattias Wennergren","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this article, we examine the proximity of the AfD to right-wing extremist civil society and the impact of right-wing extremist civil society protests on the party’s electoral performance. Using a novel social network dataset, we show that the AfD has become significantly more entrenched within Germany’s right-wing extremist civil society. We further show that protest by right-wing civil society actors with AfD participation significantly increases the party’s vote share.

"abstract_0585_0440_1239.html","Cyclical bias in Credit Ratings : How US Interest Rates Influence Sovereign Risk Assessments of Borrower Politics and Policies","Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) sovereign rating decisions are based on assessments of sovereign risk—a government’s default probability. Many studies explain rating decisions without considering the context in which those rating decisions are made: namely global risk appetite and liquidity. We theorize that rating decisions are conditional on global risk appetite, set by US interest rates. When US interest rates are high and global risk appetite is low,  rating agencies are more likely to adjust ratings based on a government’s political and economic characteristics and policies. In contrast, when US interest rates are low and global risk appetite is high, those same sovereign characteristics and policies do not lead to ratings adjustments because CRAs do not perceive them as central to risk as they do under tighter global financial conditions. To test our theory we use multiple methods, including (1) models of ratings outcomes, (2) models of ratings outlooks and (3) Latent Semantic Scaling in a Quantitative Text Analysis of Moody’s credit rating decision reports from 1988-2024. We identify how both sentiment about similar policies and ultimate changes or non-changes in ratings in response to policies and sovereign features depend on global risk appetite and liquidity. CRA sovereign assessments are not static, but vary according to global economic factors. This implies that CRA discipline of borrower politics is not constant, but varies with global interest rates, increasing pro-cyclicality in global financial markets.","Keywords: sovereign debt, credit rating agencies, market discipline","Natalya Naqvi","Ben Cormier","Strathclyde","Natalya Naqvi","LSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LSE","Strathclyde",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study seeks to explain this phenomenon by addressing two interrelated research questions: Do equality campaigns that highlight women’s subordination in the political process inadvertently deter women’s political participation? And does the portrayal of men as antagonists in such campaigns diminish their support for women’s causes?Using a survey experiment, this study tests whether content commonly featured in awareness-raising campaigns—such as cultural and material barriers to women’s political exclusion (e.g., anticipated discrimination, lack of time, and limited resources)—acts as a deterrent to women’s political engagement. It also investigates whether such content ""others"" men, thereby reducing their allyship with women’s causes. Furthermore, adopting an intersectional lens, this research employs BART methods to identify campaign narratives less prone to backlash, and tailored to different population subgroups.The findings will contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying political campaigns, advance the literature on gender and political exclusion, and provide actionable insights for designing equality campaigns that minimize risks of backlash while fostering inclusivity and engagement.","Keywords: Political participation, Diversity, Campaigns, Survey experiment, United Kingdom","Marta Antonetti","Marta Antonetti",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0588_0232_0814.html","Incumbents’ Parties and Democratic Backsliding: Enablers or Inhibitors?","Why does it take some leaders more time than others to dismantle democracy? In some cases, such as Turkey, it took more than a decade before democracy broke down, whereas in other cases as in Hungary, the process lasted only a few years. The literature on democratic backsliding is full of insights on how leaders elected in free and fair elections undermine democracy from within to remain in power. However, current studies so far have overlooked whether and how incumbents’ political parties matter for democratic backsliding onset and subsequent democratic breakdown. There is an implicit assumption that incumbents’ parties facilitate backsliding or that they do not matter altogether in the case of populist or personalist leaders (Weyland 2024; Rhodes-Purdy and Madrid 2020). The paper bridges this notable gap by making two central arguments. First, incumbents’ political parties facilitate backsliding onset but increase the duration of backsliding due to increased uncertainty and factional politics. Second, the paper argues that democratic breakdown after backsliding hinges on the ability of incumbents to de-institutionalize their parties. The paper examines seven hypotheses on the relationship between the incumbent’s partisan identity, party institutionalization, democratic backsliding and subsequent breakdown. We employ time-variant, multivariate survival regression analysis for autocratization episodes in all electoral and liberal democracies between 1945 and 2020 using data from V-Dem, the Ideologues dataset among others. The results confirm the importance of the incumbent’s party and its de-institutionalization for the onset and duration of backsliding and the subsequent breakdown of democracy.","Keywords: Democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, political parties, party de-institutionalization, presidents","Mahmoud Farag","Mahmoud Farag","Technische Universität Darmstadt","Isabella Montini","University of California, Berkeley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technische Universität Darmstadt","University of California, Berkeley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Researchers have attribute this pattern to elites pursuing partisan goals to the exclusion of voter opinion in their state. However, we argue that there are still reasons for U.S. governors to be mindful of voters' preferences and to take steps to appeal to them when they lay out their policy agendas.  We study U.S. governor's agendas as given in their state of the state (SOTS) address between 1960 and 2024 to classify whether each sentence in the SOTS is more like the other SOTS given by the Republican governors or the Democratic governors that year. We then aggregate the sentence level measures to get a score at the speech level for how partisan each speech is. Consistent with recent research we find evidence that elite partisanship predicts what governors focus on in their speeches. However, we also find that voter partisanship also predicts the content of those speeches.

"abstract_0590_0814_1377.html","Alerting Figures: A Framing Experiment on the Effect of Extremist Violence on Extremist Attitudes","The persistence of extremist violence and its societal implications raise critical questions about its impact on individuals with radical and extremist attitudes. This study investigates whether exposure to extremist violence reinforces these attitudes or triggers a backlash effect that reduces them. Drawing on theories of radicalization, I examine how information about the prevalence of extremist violence influences right-wing, left-wing, and religious radical attitudes.I conducted a survey experiment with 8,200 participants from Germany, France, Greece, and Hungary. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental groups. Each experimental group was presented with information about the prevalence of extremist violence, with varying emphasis on the type of extremism and the attack or attacker. Extremist attitudes were measured before and after the experiment using scales on right-wing, left-wing, and religious radical attitudes.The results show that information about extremist violence significantly reduces radical attitudes, thus providing evidence for a backlash effect. Demographic factors moderated these effects: women and Muslims were more likely to reduce their extremist attitudes, whereas older, more educated, and politically right-leaning participants were less responsive. These findings were robust across analyses for different types of extremism (right-wing, left-wing, religious) and checks on randomization and response patterns.This study underscores the interplay between extremist violence and attitudes, revealing potential pathways for de-radicalization and the critical role of institutional responses to extremist violence. Because the findings focus on short-term effects, future research should explore long-term effects through longitudinal designs.","Keywords: extremist attitudes, survey experiment, extremist violence, backlash effect, deradicalization","Nina Osenbrügge","Nina Osenbrügge",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"MZES, University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Authoritarian Attraction, Legitimacy and Diffusion [INTERAUTO]","Soft power is one of the most widely used concepts in political science, but it has underestimated the attractiveness of illiberal or autocratic states due to its inherent liberal bias. In response, this article proposes a framework of authoritarian attraction emphasizing the relational nature of power with three distinct analytical categories: 1) sender strategies, 2) audience preferences, and 3) behavioural outcomes. By drawing on and synthesizing existing literature on authoritarian legitimation, diffusion, and audience studies, the article uses the case of China to explore how  authoritarian attempts to attract and persuade, how these attempts are perceived abroad, and to what extent authoritarian proliferation is driven by learning and emulation. Finally, the article provides an agenda for further research to sharpen our research questions and improve our methodological approaches toward a better understanding of authoritarian attraction.","Keywords: Soft power; authoritarian attraction; diffusion; legitimacy; China","Julia Bader","Julia Bader","University of Amsterdam","Neil Loughlin","University of London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","University of London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0592_1775_1384.html","Of Polish Heroism and Victimhood: How Wikipedia Captures Collective Memory","Collective memories shape political narratives but are difficult to measure. Existing approaches largely rely on surveys, media, or textbooks, which face issues of scalability, accessibility, or representativeness. This paper introduces a framework that conceptualizes collective memories as context-specific group-role associations and leverages natural language processing tools and Wikipedia revision histories to measure their content and change over time. Focusing on the case of WWII and Holocaust memory in Poland, we provide evidence that our approach allows us to capture collective memory: In line with existing literature on contemporary Polish collective memory of WWII, WWII collective memory as estimated using Wikipedia data represents Poles as the main victims of the period, and Germans as the main perpetrators. This representation has been relatively stable over the past 20 years. These findings have important implications for empirical studies of collective memory. Firstly, they suggest that we can use Wikipedia data to capture relevant group-role associations that describe the content of collective memories. Secondly, they suggest that we can use Wikipedia to study collective memory content of different socio-linguistic groups over time.","Keywords: collective memory, Poland, Wikipedia, natural language processing, World War II","Kasia Nalewajko, Judith Spirig","Kasia Nalewajko","Collegio Carlo Alberto","Judith Spirig","UCL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UCL","Collegio Carlo Alberto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0593_1460_0958.html","Expanding global coverage of climate change support over space and time","While extensive cross-national research on climate change has focused on national positions and their influence on international climate negotiations, significantly less attention has been given to citizens' attitudes towards climate change across countries and over time. Most cross-national studies of climate change support rely on limited samples of 40–50 countries, with only a few expanding to over 100, often excluding lower-income and least-developed nations. This lack of data may lead to incomplete conclusions regarding the global distribution of climate change concern. Our study addresses this gap by using a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of climate change support for over 150 countries spanning up to 15 years. Our approach integrates survey data across time, space, and varying survey questions, producing a more comprehensive and globally representative dataset. This dataset allows us to examine the correlates of climate change attitudes, including in low- and middle-income countries that have been underrepresented in existing research. By broadening both the geographical and temporal scope, this study enhances our understanding of the factors shaping public support for climate change policies worldwide.","Keywords: Climate Politics,

"abstract_0594_0538_1016.html","GENCAREERS: Women in (Vice-) Parliamentary Presidencies – Getting the Consolation Prize?","As gender representation in political leadership becomes a focal point of public and media scrutiny, political parties face growing pressure to increase women's access to influential roles. While much attention has been given to the proportion of women in parliaments and governments, unexpectedly high numbers of women serving as parliamentary presidents and vice presidents warrant scholarly investigation. This paper investigates whether parties systematically appoint women to parliamentary presidencies as a means of compensating for their underrepresentation in more powerful positions, such as the leadership of the parliamentary party group, committee chairs, and cabinet roles. We argue that male favoritism leads to the selection of men to the posts that will be most beneficial for their political career, by strengthening their party network, policy expertise, or policy-making power. Women’s pressure for inclusion in the light of men’s overrepresentation results in women being selected for the posts that parties perceive to be a less promising career steppingstone – which is the parliamentary presidency, as it involves serving as a neutral representative of parliament, with weak party ties and no policy specialization. Using data from the StatePol dataset, which tracks political officeholders in Germany's sixteen state parliaments over a thirty-year period, we test the “consolation prize” hypothesis. Our analysis finds that parties are more likely to select women as (vice) parliamentary presidents if male dominance persists in the leadership of parliamentary party groups. These findings offer new insights into how political parties manage gender representation across various leadership positions.","Keywords: Gender, recruitment, parliament, political parties, political elites","Corinna Kroeber, Elena Frech","Corinna Kroeber","University of Greifswald","Elena Frech","Université de Namur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Greifswald","Université de Namur",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This approach allows for an accurate cross-country comparison, providing a robust basis for understanding GBV across diverse contexts. Furthermore, the study investigates the correlation between GBV prevalence and gender equality indicators, including female political participation, economic opportunities, and education levels. By analyzing these correlations, the research aims to reveal the socio-political factors that influence GBV, highlighting how disparities in gender equality may contribute to the persistence of violence. Additionally, the project explores the role of societal attitudes and cultural values in shaping GBV prevalence by drawing on data from the latest European Social Survey (ESS). This analysis will determine how public norms, beliefs, and values align with varying levels of GBV, providing deeper insights into the cultural context influencing these dynamics. Ultimately, this research offers the first comprehensive comparative analysis of GBV prevalence across the EU, incorporating data on gender equality and public attitudes. The findings will be instrumental for policymakers, social scientists, and advocates aiming to understand and mitigate the impact of GBV in Europe. This study thus makes a significant contribution by providing actionable insights into the socio-cultural and political drivers of GBV.","Keywords: gender equality; gender-based violence; comparative survey data;","Leire Rincón","Leire Rincón",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Political science studies of disasters are mostly limited to analysing politicians and voters in the immediate aftermath after the disaster. I study disasters from a different perspective to ask: How does government functioning evolve over the long term after a natural disaster?I draw on accountability and disaster studies that suggest that political responds positively to pressure, to derive an original hypothesis: local government exhibits a lasting increase in performance level in response to dealing with a natural disaster. My theory holds that occurrence of a disaster leads to the politicians facing a sustained increase in pressure from citizens to perform. This increase in pressure leads to rise in political responsiveness and long-lasting improvement in government performance levels. I assess this hypothesis using the case of India - a middle income democratic country. I use secondary data on country-wide government performance and use the interrupted time series approach to analyse the collected data and find results that support the core hypothesis. I then interview politicians from village to state level across two states of India (Kerala and Uttarakhand), to assess this hypothesis and mechanism.","Keywords: climate change, disasters, bureaucrat behaviour, government performance,   responsiveness","Preeti Nambiar","Preeti Nambiar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vanderbilt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Examining the effects of corporatism on climate policy","The effect of corporatism on climate policy -- which has received renewed attention as the literature on climate politics has taken an institutional turn -- is theoretically disputed and empirical ambiguous. Given that, this paper seeks to revisit the relationship between corporatism and climate policy theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, I will defend two sets of claims. First, I argue that corporatism is, ceteris paribus, detrimental to stringent climate policy when the carbon-intensive industry's economic heft is high, while the reverse holds when electoral competition from pro-climate green parties is high. Second, corporatism, I submit, has a tendency to impose a relatively greater share of costs on consumers than producers, especially when the economy is highly open. Yet, high electoral competitiveness, in particular when driven by green parties, counteracts this tendency. Empirically, I extend existing analyses and leverage newly available data to provide evidence for these hypotheses by estimating a series of fixed-effects specifications.","Keywords: Climate politics, Corporatism, Concertration, Coordination, Long-term policymaking","Jacob Edenhofer","Jacob Edenhofer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0598_1759_0118.html","Testing the Left-Behind Narrative Across Countries: Regional Economic Decline and Radical Right Voting in Four Western Democracies","Over the past three decades, the populist radical right (PRR) has experienced electoral success across the Western world, particularly in rural, peripheral or former industrial regions. This unequal geography of support has fuelled the 'left-behind' narrative, which posits that regional economic decline drives support for the PRR. Strongly articulated after Brexit, this narrative has gained traction to explain the rise of populism across Western Europe and beyond. This paper tests this narrative by analyzing four pivotal votes, where the PRR achieved breakthrough success: the 2016 Brexit referendum, the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the 2017 French presidential election, and the 2022 success of Giorgia Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia. Our analysis distinguishes electoral units at a detailed geographical level and assesses how regional economic decline, measured by changes in median income, depopulation and labour market decline, correlates with PRR voting patterns. Unlike previous studies aggregating several countries into a single analysis, we estimate separate models for each country, revealing considerable heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that the left-behind narrative explains voting patterns well for Brexit and for Le Pen in France. However, it works less well in the US, where Trump’s highest support came from poor but economically catching up counties. In Italy, the narrative fails completely, with the PRR thriving in wealthy and economically improving provinces. These findings caution against extrapolating the left-behind narrative across different national contexts. The relationship between regional economic conditions and populist radical right support is more complex than often assumed and shaped by unique national histories.","Keywords: radical right, geography, regional economic decline, voting behaviour, left-behind regions","Matthias Enggist","Matthias Enggist","University of Lausanne"," Daniel Oesch","University of Lausanne","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Lausanne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How malleable are public conceptions of national identity, and how do they evolve across time and space? We investigate these questions in India, where an elite consensus based around a secular understanding of national identity has -- as in many other regions around the world -- more recently given way to a dominant ethno-cultural one. First, we document a substantial rise over the previous few decades in ethnic conceptions of the nation. Second, in original surveys and a conjoint experiment, we explore the relative importance of different characteristics in defining national identity. Third, we conduct a survey experiment to explore the role of elite-led symbolic politics -- the use of ""Bharat"" versus ""India"" in speech -- in shifting conceptions of national identity. Throughout, we explore heterogeneity in perceptions not only across time, but also social groups and geographies. Our findings underline the existence of multiple, competing conceptions of national identity, demonstrate how they can differ across time and individuals, and highlight the important role of elites in shifting individuals’ perceptions.","Keywords: National Identity, Experiment, Nationalism, Symbolic Politics, India","Nicholas Haas","Nicholas Haas","Aarhus University","Emmy Lindstam","IE University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","IE University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, understanding the process of identity formation processes under turbulent and contested contexts that evolve rapidly has not received enough attention. This paper studies how group identities evolved during the protests against attacks on Palestine in the period 2023-2024. Computational text analysis is used to extract claims that were voiced by protesters in multiple events throughout Europe and the US, as represented in the media and on social media. Network analysis of the semantic relations between claims provides evidence for how demonstrators from very diverse backgrounds, contexts, and types of movements converge, and how they define group boundaries in response to salient events and the reactions of political elites and organizations. Cognitive and emotional contents in protesters’ claims show that the public expressions of anger and moral outrage were central in explaining how symbols and perceptions were internalized across national frontiers and pre-existing identities. Evidence on the central role played by students in university protests also highlights the importance of commitment and endurance in rapidly building the cognitive contents of social identities. These results shed light on the dynamics of social identity formation processes and the restructuring of group alignments in times of major social shocks.","Keywords: protest, social identity, comparative politics, social network analysis, semantic similarity","Camilo Cristancho","Camilo Cristancho",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0602_0916_0288.html","(PETAX) Releasing the Brake? The Covid-19 Pandemic, Public Attitudes, and the Schuldenbremse","Despite extensive research on public preferences towards fiscal rules, whether fiscal consolidation occurs because of or despite public opinion constraints remains debated.  In particular, while voters are often assumed to have pro-cyclical fiscal policy preferences – thereby necessitating independent fiscal rules and oversight bodies - it is unclear how public attitudes towards sound fiscal finances evolve during economic downturns when fiscal rules are unlikely to be met, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study examines the impact of the pandemic on public attitudes towards Germany’s debt brake policy (Schuldenbremse), which imposes strict limits on government borrowing. Using data from the German Internet Panel (GIP), the study applies an Unexpected Event during Survey Design methodology alongside a Difference-in-Differences estimation approach to analyse changes in public opinion following Chancellor Angela Merkel’s announcement of federal lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus. As the health situation deteriorated, it became clear that the state had to step in to sustain the economy, hence increasing government spending. Results indicate no significant immediate shift in the evaluation of the Schuldenbremse following the lockdown announcement. However, the findings suggest that public expectations regarding state-level compliance with the fiscal rule worsened over time, with attitudes towards fiscal rules not necessarily hinging on their feasibility. The results contribute to the understanding of public attitudes towards public debt and fiscal consolidation, offering key insights into the post-pandemic discourse on fiscal rules in Germany and beyond.","Keywords: political economy, fiscal policy, debt, schuldenbremse","Irene Germani","Irene Germani",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a new dataset covering the establishment and design of over 4,000 special economic zones across 172 countries, as well as the domestic laws governing such zones. We investigate the diffusion of zones both globally and through a case study of Uganda, an electoral autocracy that has invested heavily in expanding international trade and investment through free zones. Globally, we find that autocracies tend to have more SEZs than democracies. Consistent with our cross-national results, we find that electoral support for the Ugandan incumbent president increases in communities near recently established zones relative to communities near soon-to-be established zones. Survey respondents closer to zones also report high levels of personal economic well-being and economic optimism.

Countries with higher levels of concern about misinformation had lower GDP per capita, lower press freedom, and higher levels of corruption. In these countries, respondents were more concerned about misinformation on messaging apps and misinformation coming from their government rather than from foreign governments.

While some studies find that repression can be effective, at least in the short term, a strand of this literature doubts its effectiveness due to backlash mobilization. However, despite widespread discussions, studying the underlying mechanisms through which the backlash mechanism influences dissidents and their mobilization has received limited attention. This study argues that the rise of social media platforms for keeping and sharing personal diaries, especially among the younger generation, increases the likelihood of backlash mobilization in response to the state’s violent response to protests. Building on scholarship from psychology and communication science, I develop a theoretical framework to explain how the digital diaries of the victims of state repression brace protestors and increase social cohesion among dissidents. The study examines the proposed theoretical arguments by analyzing the nexus of repression-protest during the “Woman, Life, Freedom” revolutionary uprising in Iran. I use machine learning to analyze an originally collected dataset on the digital presence (image, video, and text) of citizens killed by the state and data on street protests and online campaigns to show that digital diaries have created online and offline backlash effects.","Keywords: repression, mobilization, social media, violence, backlash","Babak RezaeeDaryakenari","Babak RezaeeDaryakenari",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But how does competition and cooperation at these different levels impact dynamics between parties on other levels? The literature on coalitions and party competition has focused on the dynamics between parties in single parliaments. Here, we extend this literature to multi-level settings. We argue that national coalitions, their internal dynamics as well as the national electoral cycle impact interactions between parliamentary parties at the state level. The analysis is based on a dataset of parliamentary debates covering almost 30 years of state-level and national debates in German parliaments. Using applause as a measure of support, we show that parties in national government are more supportive of each other in state parliaments, but less so than they are at the national level. We also find that mutual support in national parliament is strongly correlated with support in state parliaments. These results highlight multi-level interactions as an important and hitherto under-explored element of inter-party relations.

Federalism is often praised as the ideal solution for how a community should deal with this heterogeneity. However, a dark side of this institutional arrangement is the unequal treatment of people with a migratory background in local administrations and regional courts. The paper presents a theoretical framework to explain how the local anti-immigration mood and other extra-legal factors contribute to the discriminatory decisions of administrators and judges within a federal context. Integrating classical theories of discrimination and the literature on illiberal beliefs, I argue that decision-makers exposed to anti-migration attitudes, consciously or unconsciously, adopt the preferences of their informal regional peers. Novel datasets linking the asylum determination decisions by the offices of the German Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) spread out over the country to the 48 administrative courts that make the final decision on an asylum request allow me to test these conjectures. The preliminary evidence reveals that courts can reduce the discriminatory behavior of federal agents who operate in anti-migration environments.","Keywords: Federalism, comparative politics, asylum, discrimination, courts","Gerald Schneider","Gerald Schneider",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While existing literature emphasizes the influence of objective and subjective group membership on electoral choice, it often overlooks voters’ sympathy or antipathy toward groups they do not belong to. We argue that this framework is particularly effective in understanding SVP voting.Like other radical right parties in Europe, the SVP exploits resentment toward outgroups to mobilize support. During the 2023 campaign, the SVP targeted asylum seekers and migrants in a nationwide leaflet campaign and, earlier, launched a campaign against “wokeness,” opposing gender-sensitive language and feminist demands tied to the June 2023 women’s strike.Using data from the 2023 Swiss Election Study Panel, we measure feelings toward social groups and perceptions of party-group associations in the first panel wave, before the campaign, and party choice in the postelection wave to address endogeneity concerns. We demonstrate that negative feelings toward migrants and feminists significantly shape SVP voting, directly and in interaction with the perceived association of these groups with the left, on top of known determinants like socio-structural factors (e.g., class or rural residency) and issue positions (e.g., migration policy).This study contributes to understanding radical right voting in Western Europe by highlighting the importance of group-based resentment and perceptions in shaping electoral behavior.","Keywords: radical right, voting behavior, reference groups, social group attitudes, party-group associations","Anke Tresch","Anke Tresch","University of Lausanne; FORS","Line Rennwald","FORS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Lausanne","FORS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing models by economists assume that default is a strategy to appropriate foreign capital, ignore domestic politics, and thus fail to explain almost a third of all cases of non-payment of sovereign debt since 1983. In this paper, we present a formal model explaining the choice of a government on which creditors to default and whom to spare. We find that the probability of default on different creditor types varies with the ability of governments to tax different domestic voter groups. As our model predicts a nonlinear relationship, we use double machine learning to test our predictions.

The field of gender and voting behaviour is large and well established but little research has considered the role that local election dynamics play in gendered outcomes. The overwhelming focus of the extant research is on national level gender differences in party of vote that rely heavily on sociological explanations for any divergence between men and women. Too little attention has been paid to how political campaigns influence variation in gender gaps across time and space. Recent work has returned to the role that electoral context plays (Shorrocks 2021 etc.) but has overwhelmingly focused on the national rather than local campaign. Here we focus on both the micro and meso sources of the gender differences in party support, investigating how individual decisions are shaped by the specific nature of party competition in electoral districts and how these aggregate to national gender gaps. We utilise discontinuity and matching techniques to establish how party campaigning (measured using local constituency spend) activates underlying gender differences in political attitudes and preferences.","Keywords: Elections, Geography, Gender, Multilevel, Local","Ceri Fowler","Ceri Fowler","St Hilda's College, Oxford","Rosalind Shorrocks","University of Manchester","Anna Sanders","University of York","Rosie Campbell","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","St Hilda's College, Oxford","University of Manchester","University of York","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0611_1445_0750.html","Does the rise of populist parties undermine mainstream support for climate change mitigation? Evidence from European Parliament roll-call votes","Climate change mitigation policies often impose concentrated costs in exchange for diffuse future benefits. They can ignite intense political debate, as the short-term costs associated with decarbonization disproportionately impact specific industries and communities, such as agriculture, energy, and working-class households. The associated burden has spurred opposition from stakeholders and a prominent backlash from populist parties, which politicize green policies as elitist impositions on everyday citizens. This raises the question whether mainstream political actors may react to the electoral pressure from populist parties and become less supportive of green policies. While the theoretical argument is compelling, it is not as easy to provide systematic evidence for such an effect. To do so, we make use of the fact that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from different countries, with varying trajectories of populist parties’ popularity, vote on the same proposals. Drawing on roll-call votes that deal with salient EU environmental legislation as identified by environmental NGOs, we use an extended spatial model of parliamentary voting to analyze the reactions of individual MEPs. The findings suggest that while populist actors politicize environmental issues, mainstream MEPs may respond by consolidating their pro-environment stances, potentially to attract centrist or left-leaning voters concerned with climate action. Our results also challenge the assertion that mainstream parties have assumed pro-mitigation policies across the board. The study contributes to the broader literature on climate policy and the politicization of environmental issues, offering a valuable perspective on the interplay between populist forces and support for environmental policies.","Keywords: European Parliament, climate change, populism, party competition, environmental politics","Thomas Daeubler","Thomas Daeubler","University College Dublin","Mihail Chiru","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University College Dublin","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0612_1126_0815.html","Disputing Democracy: Asymmetric Polarization and Authoritarianism in Party Systems","Political parties play an increasingly important role in episodes of democratic erosion and breakdown. Prior research identifies a pattern in which parties that are not committed to democracy exploit societal divisions and foster polarization to mobilize support, ultimately gaining power and dismantling democratic institutions. Although this pattern has certainly taken place in some countries, it is still not clear whether it explains the general rise of parties that contest democracy that has taken place in recent years. This paper investigates the factors contributing to this rise, focusing on one critical part of this sequence: the relationship between ideological polarization and the prevalence of undemocratic positions within party systems. Specifically, it distinguishes between polarization on cultural issues and economic redistribution. To do that, it draws on data from the V-Party dataset, which includes information on party positions regarding economic, cultural and governance issues across 121 countries from 1970 to 2019.

This paper examines whether and how the media contribute to accountability. Drawing on an extensive archive of local newspaper at TV newscast transcripts, media market and circulation data, state legislative roll-call votes, and measures of district-level public opinion on five policy areas, I find that media coverage is associated with greater policy responsiveness in state legislatures. I do so focusing on five policy areas in which states do a considerable amount of lawmaking and for which public opinion can be readily measured: abortion, LGBTQ rights, police accountability, the minimum wage, and gun control.However, defying the seminal theories of electoral accountability, I find no evidence that the media affects what the public knows about state politics or how they behave in state legislative elections. Rather, I conjecture that local news affects representation via a more direct, elite-focused ""watchdog"" mechanism--by informing legislators about public opinion or increasing the perceived costs that politicians face when deciding to cast an unpopular vote.","Keywords: representation, responsiveness, media, electoral accountability","Michael Auslen","Michael Auslen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Postdoctoral Fellow and Incoming Assistant Professor, University of Texas at Austin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A Computational Analysis of Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric","What leads mainstream elites to adopt inflammatory rhetoric targeting immigrants and ethnic minorities? Such rhetoric has significant implications for everything from public opinion and party politics, to inter-group attitudes and social norms, and yet we know surprisingly little about what induces mainstream parties to accommodate far right rhetoric in the first place. I analyze mainstream rhetoric by using a hitherto underutilized data source, namely parliamentary speeches, where I employ a novel computational text analysis approach to identify anti-immigrant and anti-minority rhetoric by MPs in six European countries. Results indicate that mainstream parties tend to emulate far right rhetoric following far right party electoral successes, corroborating findings from the literature on positional accommodation.  However, evidence suggests that mainstream elites also initially opt rhetorical accommodation before positional accommodation. The article contributes to the burgeoning literature on the interplay between mainstream and far right elites, by investigating the oft neglected rhetorical dimension of politics.","Keywords: mainstream, far-right, accommodation, parliamentary speeches","Ali Karcic","Ali Karcic",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0615_0867_0885.html","Importing networked control? How economic cooperation shapes digital authoritarianism [INTERAUTO]","How do trade relationships with authoritarian countries shape governments’ preferences for digital repression? Recent research links Chinese exports of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to greater use of digital repressive tactics, such as internet shutdowns. Chinese technology is often dual-use, supporting both infrastructure development and state control over digital communication. However, the repertoire of digital repression tactics is broad, ranging from targeted surveillance to indiscriminate internet shutdowns, with significant differences in economic cost: internet shutdowns disrupt business, while content takedowns or spyware usage are less costly. Thus, acquiring potentially repressive technologies alone does not fully explain their use.We argue that importing ICTs from China is necessary but insufficient for employing digital repression tactics. Trade relationships influence both the availability and deployment of tactics. Specifically, two types of trade relationships explain variation in governments’ use of digital repression. Homogeneous cross-border trade with neighboring autocracies—focused on raw materials—is unaffected by the costs of indiscriminate repression and does not incentivize cost-sensitive tactics. In contrast, heterogeneous trade with China—importing internet-reliant technology in exchange for raw and manufactured goods—discourages costly repression like internet shutdowns while encouraging subtler tactics.To test this argument, we construct a dataset covering African states (2014–2023) with variables capturing tech imports, trade complexity, and different digital repression tactics. Preliminary results show imports from China reduce internet shutdowns but increase less costly tactics like spyware usage. This effect is absent in trade with neighboring autocracies. Leveraging frameworks from international political economy, this research contributes to understanding external drivers of digital authoritarianism.","Keywords: Autocracy, Trade, Censorship, Surveillance, China","Maurice Schumann","Maurice Schumann","Hertie School","Fabiola Schwarz","Technical University of Munich / Hochschule für Politik München","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School","Technical University of Munich / Hochschule für Politik München",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because it is ultimately the engagement of citizens that makes the difference between obsolete historical facts and dynamic collective memory, it is important to understand citizens’ reactions to materials about historical atrocities. However, the evidence from different disciplines is mixed. While some studies highlight possible negative effects (e.g., increased defensiveness), others underline the positive effects (e.g., support for democratic values and actors). Existing studies differ in terms of their treatment, and to some extent also how they measured the outcomes. Our research aims to comprehensively understand if and when reading about historical atrocities has positive vs. negative effects, and if it has any effect at all on contemporary intergroup relations. We employ survey experiments in five different countries: Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the US. These countries are very similar to each other in many aspects (e.g., Western, democratic, and economically developed), but differ with respect to memory culture and the specifics of the atrocities. The treatment is as uniform as possible. Participants read a text that provides information on what happened, when it happened, the scale of the atrocities, the suffering of victims, and the complicity of civilians. Our analysis points to positive effects on intergroup relations and highlights the importance of structural factors (e.g., memory culture and public discourse).","Keywords: atrocities, intergroup relations, acknowledgment","Oguzhan Turkoglu","Oguzhan Turkoglu","Hertie School","Ruth Ditlmann","Hertie School","Berenike Firestone","WZB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School","WZB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0617_1596_0960.html","The Exposure Effect of Social Science and Humanities Courses on Political Orientations","Research on the effect of education on political orientations has typically focused on the degree obtained rather than the specific exposure to different fields of study. Studies investigating political orientations in higher education typically struggle with identifying causal effects due to their unit of measure, the degree obtained. Yet the differences in political orientations between fields of study among the college-educated are apparent. In this study, we use micro-data as a more granular measure of exposure to education, specifically measuring the social science and humanities course credits of undergraduate students at a large public university in California. By measuring exposure using courses within these departments, we can disentangle the selection effects from the causal impact of students’ exposure to social sciences or humanities. Since the treatment effect of exposure doesn’t depend on the student’s chosen degree, in contrast to previous research. Employing recent methodological advances in Difference-in-Differences estimators, we test the causal impact of exposure to social science and humanities courses on political orientation using inverse probability weighting. Combining the UCI MUST survey data with course data, we find that exposure to social science and humanities courses causally predicts a leftward shift in political orientations. Our analysis reveals that the effect of exposure is both significant and robust, accounting for self-selection biases and peer influences. The young and highly educated are socialized by exposure to these courses to become more left-leaning than their peers. Our findings highlight the consequences of overlooking exposure when identifying socialization effects among the highly educated.","Keywords: Exposure, Higher Education,  Causal Inference, Exposure Effects, Selection Effects, Difference-in-Differences,  Political Orientation, Political Ideology, Civic Engagement, Courses, Education, Socialization, Political Cleavages, Ideological Shifts, Selection Bias, Political Behavior, Social Science, Humanities, Public University Education, Micro-data","Martin Dybdahl","Martin Dybdahl","PhD Scholar at European University Institute","Herman van de Werfhorst","Professor at European University Institute","Simon Hix","Professor at European University Institute","Richard Arum","Professor at University of California, Irvine","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Scholar at European University Institute","Professor at European University Institute","Professor at European University Institute","Professor at University of California, Irvine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scholars have long argued that political elites are highly strategic, particularly in making decisions about ambition for offices beyond their current position. But how do shifting opportunities for political advancement shape legislators' behavior in their current offices? We argue that legislators adjust their behavior as institutional reforms change their prospects. Focusing on Argentina and women’s limited opportunities to compete for political office, we leverage an uneven roll out of provincial-level gender quotas; as subnational careers often follow national service in Argentina, these quotas changed the opportunities available to women in the national legislature in the next stage of their career. We expect that, absent gender quotas, men in the national legislature will be more likely than women to introduce legislation targeting local jurisdictions, a common credit-claiming strategy for national legislators who might want a future subnational position. The introduction of gender quotas at the provincial legislature levels the playing field by increasing the chances that women in the national legislature can continue their political careers in their home districts. Consequently, once provincial gender quotas are in place, the gender gap in local credit-claiming legislation disappears. Our work speaks to the ways in which institutional changes can shape the behavior of a wide set of political elites and the strategic behavior of those in political office.","Keywords: gender, gender quotas, political careers, ambition, legislation, Argentina","Mirya Holman","Tiffany Barnes","University of Texas, Austin","Mirya Holman","Hobby School of Public Affairs, University of Houston","Agustín Vallejo","Hobby School of Public Affairs, University of Houston","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Texas, Austin","Hobby School of Public Affairs, University of Houston",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While existing literature has focused on how the existence of IPV courts influences the demand side—specifically, the reporting of gender violence—less is known about their impact on the supply side, particularly whether these courts increase convictions and enhance judicial outcomes. We hypothesize that IPV courts also influence judicial outcomes by fostering specialization among judges, enabling them to evaluate evidence more effectively and resolve cases more efficiently. To analyze this effect, we use data on conviction rates, protection orders, and victim support measures from Spanish judicial districts spanning 2005 to 2023, sourced from the General Council of the Judiciary (GCPJ). Employing a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, we compare districts with and without IPV courts, leveraging population thresholds and temporal variation in court establishment to identify causal effects.

However, key questions remain: What conditions foster acceptance of expert advice? Do preferences vary across policy domains or stakeholder groups? This paper addresses these gaps through a large-scale experimental vignette study involving three key actors: citizens, politicians, and experts.Using a mixed-factorial design, the study manipulates two factors: the alignment of expert advice with participants’ preferences (favorable vs. unfavorable) and the nature of policy domains (morally-based vs. knowledge-based). Respondents evaluate hypothetical scenarios that explore the acceptability and legitimacy of three types of expert involvement. This innovative approach examines whether stakeholder attitudes differ between morally charged issues (e.g., free speech, LGBTQ+ rights) and knowledge-intensive domains (e.g., economic policy).By including multiple stakeholder groups, the study moves beyond citizen-focused research to capture politicians’ and experts’ perspectives, providing a multi-actor view of technocratic legitimacy. Additionally, the design isolates whether support for expert involvement depends on issue characteristics or aligns with broader distrust in politicians.This paper enhances our understanding of technocratic governance by bridging experimental rigor with practical relevance. It provides fresh insights into the factors influencing support for expert involvement, contributing to broader discussions on democratic legitimacy, political representation, and how electoral systems shape the role of experts in policy-making within increasingly knowledge-driven societies.","Keywords: Technocratic Governance, Stakeholder Attitudes, Expert Involvement, Policy Domains, Democratic Legitimacy","Janne Ingelbeen","Janne Ingelbeen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Ghent University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0621_2389_0048.html","Not In My Basement: The Political Costs of Climate Action","How can we understand public opposition to reforms that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and induce a clean-energy transition? Previous work documents that exposure to the material costs of a policy reform can generate public disapproval, but much less is known about the extent to which voters anticipate the costliness of climate reforms and voice opposition already in the policy formation stage that precedes actual implementation. We study these dynamics in the context of Germany in the spring of 2023, when the government coalition announced an amendment to the Gebäudeenergiegesetz (buildings energy act, “GEG”). This amendment, which was advanced by the Green Party, should accelerate the replacement of fossil fuel-based heating systems with electricity-based systems in residential buildings. We study how the announcement of this reform affected public approval of incumbent parties and politicians, led to an electoral realignment toward the right-wing anti-environmental party AfD, and caused a public backlash, more broadly, for the support of environmental policies. We examine our argument at the individual, regional, and national level using an integrated observational and experimental research design. We use individual-level panel data, local election results, and high-frequency polling data in combination with difference-in-differences estimators to explore how expected exposure to policy-related costs affected support for incumbent parties, the Green Party, the radical right, and climate action more generally. We further investigate the sources of climate policy resistance by exploring voters' narratives and (mis)perceptions using a survey experiment and AI chatbot-based qualitative interviews.","Keywords: climate politics, voting behavior, public opinion, causal inference","Nils Blossey, Paul Michel","Michael Bechtel","University of Cologne"," Nils Blossey","University of Cologne"," Paul Michel","University of Cologne","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Cologne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the subject of partisan bias remains underexplored. I test the extent of partisan bias in India, where previous studies have found little impact of informational interventions, but partisanship as a possible mechanism behind this has been uninvestigated. Using survey experiments and observational data, I find performance assessment of the incumbent government to be strongly associated with people’s pre-existing partisan ties. Partisans affiliated with the opposition party significantly downgrade their evaluation of the government upon exposure to negative information, particularly regarding corruption scandals. In contrast, news of ethnic violence has a weaker impact. Importantly, partisans with affiliation to the incumbent remain unmoved irrespective of the subject of exposure. Drawing on observational data collected before and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic reinforces these findings: even pandemic related mortality and administrative mismanagment in this period does not shift attachment to one's own party. These results contribute to an emergent literature on bias outside the developed world, where lower institutional safeguards make the presence of partisan bias all the more worrying.","Keywords: Partisanship, Motivated Reasoning, Partisan Bias, Experiments, India, Developing Democracies","Ankita Barthwal","Ankita Barthwal",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find comportment is a desired end in itself, not just a signal of willingness to provide material benefits.

However, the police response to protest actions remains, even today, a relatively underexplored area. This paper aims to address this gap. What factors explain police intervention during protests? When and why does this intervention involve the use of force? What are the predictors of police violence against political protest movements? To answer these questions, we draw on Protest Event Analysis (PEA) using a comprehensive, original dataset developed as part of the Disobedient Democracy (DISDEM) and Evolution of Political Contention in Spain (ECOPOL) research projects. The dataset contains information on protests held in Spain between 2000 and 2020 (n=4623). By applying statistical regression models, we aim to identify the key variables that significantly influence police intervention and the use of force during collective protests. Specifically, we examine the effects of both the characteristics of the mobilization (in terms of weakness vs. threat) and the political opportunity structures for repression shaped by the context of the protest. This includes factors such as the size and duration of the mobilization, the confrontation tactics employed, the nature of the demands, the identity of the organizers, and the political orientation of the government in power. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a framework that identifies the key factors influencing police control of protests in Spain over the past two decades.","Keywords: Contentious politics, repression, violence, policing of protest","Patricia Pinta Sierra","Patricia Pinta Sierra","Universidad Rey Juan Carlos","Eduardo Romanos Fraile","Universidad Complutense de Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Rey Juan Carlos","Universidad Complutense de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Corresponding with this rise in outward investment are industrial policies, where emerging market governments use financial subsidies to incentivise their firms’ outward investments.  Why are developing countries increasingly adopting policies that would shift capital outside of a capital-scarce economy? To explain this puzzle, I argue that outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) confers developmental benefits to developing economies similar to those usually fulfilled by inward FDI flows (IFDI). Developing countries that experience less success harnessing developmental benefits from IFDI are thus more likely to adopt a policy strategy of supporting OFDI.I test my theory using a mixed methods approach, combining a quantitative analysis from 84 emerging markets, as well as case studies of India and Brazil. This paper employs an original dataset of outward investment policies (ranging from subsidies, development loans, and equity support for mergers & acquisitions) coded from Export-Import banks in 84 emerging markets. Using this data, I test the core argument that global value chain integration is a key determinant of outward-facing investment policies, particularly the use of M&A support and equity finance. Further, I test the causal mechanisms underpinning the shift towards overseas investment finance with case studies from India and Brazil drawing from interviews conducted over thirteen months of fieldwork in both countries.

Using a voting advice application and a conversational chatbot to mitigate political hostility in Poland","In the recent US affective polarization literature, the focus has clearly shifted on reducing partisan animosity. Several studies have confirmed that it is, indeed, possible to depolarize the electorate with various interventions (e.g. the megastudy by Voelkel et al. 2024). However, similar efforts remain almost non-existent in Europe and the rest of the world. With this paper, we aim to address this gap by developing and testing interventions to reduce affective polarization prior to the Polish presidential election (May 2025). Poland constitutes a suitable case for such endeavor, as it has simultaneously experienced increasing affective polarization, democratic backsliding and decreasing social solidarity.Our project focuses on informing voters via online civic education tools. In particular, we try to correct their potential misperceptions about different candidates and their supporters – an approach that has shown promising results in the US context. We plan to identify the issues with largest misperceptions about the opposing side in the Polish context and address these with two online tools: a voting advice application (VAA) informing people about the real policy positions of the candidates, and a conversational chatbot that is aimed at correcting misperceptions about the supporters of different parties/candidates. Shortly before the election, we will field a survey experiment to test the effects of both interventions on feelings toward different parties, candidates and their supporters, and potential democratic norm violations.

"abstract_0629_1345_0414.html","Safe City, Silent Opposition: How Digital Surveillance Transforms Protests and Repression in Russia","Since the end of the Cold War, authoritarian regimes have undergone significant transformations to adapt to the new international dynamics and become more resilient to the increasing democratization pressures. As part of this process, they are increasingly adopting digital surveillance systems as an efficient information-gathering mechanism to further control the population. However, little is known about the impact of these systems on opposition dynamics and state repression. Drawing from formal models of authoritarian politics and information theory, this paper examines how digital surveillance systems affect protests and repression in electoral autocracies. This paper argues that digital surveillance systems substantially reduce the costs of repression, as they allow dictators to monitor and target dissenting citizens. This, in turn, substantially increases citizens’ costs to participate in anti-government activities, forcing the opposition to adapt its contentious repertoire in response. When digital surveillance systems start being implemented in a city, it is expected that targeted repression will increase and mass gatherings will decrease and be replaced by spontaneous disruptive performances. However, when the density of these systems in a city are high enough and effectively capable of monitoring all citizens’ movements and activities, they will deter any opposition activity, leading to a reduction of any form of anti-government political participation and state repression. To test these arguments, I use public procurement data and government documents to analyze the impact of the digital surveillance program “Safe City” in Russia on anti-government activities and targeted repression in 180 cities from 2011 to 2021.","Keywords: Authoritarianism, digital surveillance, repression, protests","Héctor Martínez Pérez","Héctor Martínez Pérez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extending beyond voting rights, the analysis also examines public attitudes toward non-citizen access to free healthcare and citizenship to explore whether opinions shift depending on the rights under consideration. Findings reveal that instrumental motivations, often attributed to political calculus, are strongly influenced by perceptions of cultural and economic alignment, highlighting the role of ethnocentric dynamics.

This is puzzling as the political actors these citizens support often behave in ways that counter the very principles of established democracies. While social desirability effects and alternative understandings of 'democracy' have been discussed as potential explanations, another potential way is to consider the alternatives to democracy in a systematic way. While some studies have asked citizens about the desirability of non-democratic alternatives, these questions are often open to interpretation about their level of 'non-democraticness' and asked in parallel to the desirability of democracy. In contrast, this study builds on innovative surveys fielded in the Netherlands and the UK that explicitly contrasts democratic and non-democratic alternatives. These survey items make respondents choose between a democratic and undemocratic version of elections, representation and accountability where the undemocratic version is presented clearly undemocratic but attractive (e.g. 'my party always wins the elections').

However, this debate has been hampered by conceptual ambiguity, reliance on individual cases, and insufficient attention to borrower agency. We address these limitations by developing a more precise conceptual framework for identifying debt-trap diplomacy. Drawing on research in international political economy and authoritarian politics, we propose multiple empirical approaches to examine debt-trap dynamics. Using data on Chinese lending patterns and borrower characteristics from 2000-2020, we find limited evidence for the conventional debt-trap narrative. However, our analysis reveals that certain combinations of lender practices and borrower characteristics - particularly personalist authoritarian regimes with weak institutions - create conditions conducive to unsustainable debt. Our findings suggest that while ""debt-trap diplomacy"" may be too simplistic a characterization, the interaction between Chinese lending practices and recipient country political institutions merits attention. This study advances the debate by providing conceptual clarity, systematic evidence, and a clearer understanding of how domestic political factors shape international lending relationships.","Keywords: sovereign debt, default, debt-trap, China","Patrick Shea","Patrick Shea",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Glasgow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Meanwhile, emerging evidence highlights the presence of 'sexually modern nativists' - voters who support gender equality but oppose immigration - as a significant PRR constituency. At the same time, while PRR parties are generally more gender-traditional than mainstream parties, there is substantial variation across Europe in the extent to which these parties emphasise gender issues and the positions they take on them. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis to examine the relationship between gender attitudes and PRR party support across the region. Specifically, we investigate whether this relationship varies depending on the salience attached to gender and the position taken by PRR parties. To do so, we exploit data from the Horizon Europe funded UNTWIST project. We match novel data from automated coding of European party manifestos – capturing the salience and positions on gender issues - with survey data on gender attitudes from cross-national surveys such as the EVS, ISSP, and ESS. This approach allows us to assess the extent to which PRR parties across Europe attract support from voters with specific attitudes on gender issues, and whether this is moderated by the extent to which gender is politicised by the parties themselves.","Keywords: gender attitudes, issue salience, populist radical right, vote choice, comparative politics","Giuseppe Carteny","Giuseppe Carteny","Department of European Social Research, Saarland University; Interdisciplinary Institute for Societal Computing, Saarland University","Louise Luxton","University of Manchester","Rosalind Shorrocks","University of Manchester","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Manchester","Department of European Social Research, Saarland University","Interdisciplinary Institute for Societal Computing, Saarland University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Still, most research addressing this topic focuses on descriptive, rather than substantive representation, pointing to the low number of representatives or candidates variously defined as “young”. Instead, this paper assesses to what extent political elites take up the issue priorities of the youth.   Specifically, we study legislative debates to capture representativeness in the parliamentary arena, beyond electoral pledges or party manifestos. We retrieve party issue emphasis through the ParlEE corpus of plenary speeches in the legislative chambers of 28 European countries (2009-2019). We then match it with young voters’ priorities from Eurobarometer, to measure our outcome of interest: issue congruence between parties in parliament and voters below the age of 30. We examine three factors that we expect to increase the congruence between young voters and elected representatives. First, the electoral system, as more proportional systems can improve the representation of specific groups such as women, minorities, or low-income citizens. Second, the share of young citizens among the party’s voting base (taken from the ESS), since we can expect parties to respond to their own supporters. Third, the age composition of the legislature, to explicitly test the connection between descriptive and substantive representation (from the WARP dataset).  By showing to what extent and under what conditions political elites represent the priorities of young voters, this paper contributes to research on the underrepresentation of disadvantaged groups' preferences and the factors that could help mitigate it. ","Keywords: youth, representation, congruence, political parties","Henrik Bech Seeberg","Sofia Marini","Aarhus University"," Henrik Bech Seeberg","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing studies suggest a positive association between these two concepts, yet it remains unclear whether these concepts represent distinct or similar psychological predispositions. This research note aims to assess the boundaries between populist attitudes and conspiracy mentality, arguing that while both share a Manichean outlook - perceiving the world divided into good and evil forces - they represent two empirically distinct concepts. Using exploratory, network and confirmatory factor analyses, we show that populism at the individual-level and conspiracy mentality are indeed two distinct, but related factors.

While states typically align with IOs that reflect their regime type, many democratic IOs now include autocratizing regimes. These IOs often lack tools to prevent or sanction democratic erosion, or focus too narrowly on empowering executives and monitoring elections instead of promoting broader democratic norms. In the paper, I argue that a yet under-researched international dimension of autocratization is the strategic engagement of leaders with autocratic clubs through observer status. Turkey, for instance, has been a dialogue partner in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) since 2012, learning about illiberal practices through active engagement with other fully autocratic member states. Using statistical analysis, the paper examines whether autocratizing regimes deliberately seek entry into authoritarian ROs as observers, and whether observer status correlates with further domestic autocratization. The findings contribute to the study of the international dimensions of autocratization, shedding light on the strategic use of tiered membership and observer status in advancing authoritarian rule.

Although earlier comparative studies have documented significant differences between post-communist and non-post-communist contexts, we still lack clarity on how these patterns have evolved in Central and Eastern Europe after more than three decades of political and economic convergence.Older generations who experienced life under communist regimes are gradually being replaced by younger cohorts who matured under new political conditions. In addition, EU accession has normalized Western political agendas in many countries throughout the region. Finally, turbulent shifts in party systems and elite-level factors—such as the rise of populism—may further influence the trajectory of belief alignment.Drawing on multiple sources of public opinion data, we conduct age-period-cohort analyses (1990–2020) to identify shifts in beliefs and their alignment across the region. In addition, we field an original cross-country survey in three heterogeneous countries—Czechia, Hungary, and Lithuania (N = 4,296)—to more thoroughly examine intra-country differences in belief alignment across 13 contemporary political issues of high policy relevance. Using correlational class analysis, we find that populations are divided into multiple groups based on their belief structures. While some groups display configurations that diverge from Western patterns or are fragmented, a substantial portion (over one third) shares belief structures similar to those found in Western contexts. In an exploratory extension, we further characterize these groups according to their socio-economic profiles and voting behaviors, highlighting several potential avenues for future research.","Keywords: Post-communism, Belief alignment, Central and Eastern Europe","Tadeas Cely","Tadeas Cely","Masaryk University, Brno","Lenka Hrbkova","Masaryk University, Brno","Matej Jungwirth","Northwestern University, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Masaryk University, Brno","Northwestern University, USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0640_2271_0956.html","IPD meta-analysis for political science","There has been an increasing focus on external validity, both in terms of replication and generalisation, in political science and, especially, in experimental political science. With this increasing focus comes the proliferation of fixed and random effects meta-analysis models to pool experiment-level estimates across contexts to answer political science questions. However, few political scientists to date have made use of the individual-level data that is now readily available for thousands of studies, to perform individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. IPD meta-analysis allows researchers to test theories of individual-level treatment effect moderation that most individual experiments are underpowered for, and which are of interest to political scientists. In this paper, we set out best practices for IDP meta-analysis and effect heterogeneity analysis from other fields such as medicine and epidemiology, and make two methodological contributions. First, we think about how we can efficiently estimate uncertainty in common experimental set-ups, where intervention arms share the same control group and are clustered within experiments. Second, we extend this set-up to heterogeneity analysis with one and multiple moderators. We apply these new methods to a novel individual level dataset of get-out-the-vote interventions that aim to increase turnout, testing what groups such treatments mobilize most.","Keywords: meta-analyses, experimental methodology, individual-level data","Francisco Tomas-Valiente","Francisco Tomas-Valiente","ETH Zurich","Asli Ceren Cinar","Juan March Institute -Universidad Carlos III - Madrid","Florian Foos","London School of Economics and Political Science","Peter John","King’s College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","Juan March Institute -Universidad Carlos III - Madrid","London School of Economics and Political Science","King’s College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Examining Gender, Parenthood and Electoral Outcomes among Candidates GENCAREERS","Is there a fatherhood bonus or a motherhood penalty for political candidates? Extensive research on gender gaps in pay and the labor force suggest that, on having children, mothers tend to be penalized, while fathers are often rewarded. Experimental studies applied to politics offer mixed evidence, with some reporting that men politicians are rewarded for having children more than women are while others find no such evidence. Thus far little research investigates this question using observational data at the candidate level. We argue that similar dynamics could be at play in politics, with parenthood impacting the chances of electoral success for women and men in different ways. To test this argument, we use data from the Comparative Candidate Survey to explore patterns of self-predicted and actual electoral success and motivation to run for office by gender and parenthood across countries and over time. Initial results suggest an interactive effect between gender and parenthood: parenthood is linked to different patterns of electoral success for men versus women. We report evidence consistent with a fatherhood bonus, but not a motherhood penalty. Men who have dependent children are more likely to win their election than men without children. For women, conversely, having dependent children is not associated with different chances of electoral success. These descriptive findings highlight the ongoing political relevance of the gendered dynamics of parenthood.","Keywords: political recruitment, parenthood, comparative, gender","Jessica Smith","Jessica Smith","University of Southampton","Ana Weeks","University of Bath","Susan Franceschet","University of Calgary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southampton","University of Bath","University of Calgary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While Sweden introduced consent-based rape legislation in 2018, Norway is in the process of revising its current, coercion-based rape legislation. Drawing on expressive law theory, this paper seeks to disentangle how a consent-based legal reform affects perceived social norms and individual attitudes on sexual consent. Given that states employ rape legislation as a measure not only to sanction, but to prevent unwanted sexual behavior from happening in the first place – it is important to understand how the communication of a law matters for its expressive function. This paper compares how representative samples of Norwegian and Swedish citizens view sexual consent across two time periods. To ascertain whether there is an overall effect of a consent-based legal reform, I employ a difference-in-differences design to examine whether there is a shift in perceived social norms and attitudes among Norwegian respondents after the rape legislation revision. Implementing a survey experiment in both countries, I test whether the effect of additional information about the contents of the rape law and its implications modifies perceived social norms and individual attitudes on sexual consent. If the 2018 legislative change to consent-based rape legislation in Sweden shifted social norms and individual attitudes on sexual consent, the treatment effects should be smaller in Sweden than in Norway.","Keywords: legal reform, consent, rape legislation","Eli Sofie Baltzersen","Eli Sofie Baltzersen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0643_0969_1111.html","The Pursuit of Fairness: Can Media Literacy Interventions Reduce Discrimination in Welfare Offices?","Discrimination in welfare offices, especially in times of increasing misinformation and negative media coverage on immigration, poses a critical challenge to fairness in public administration. Research shows that such media reporting shapes public opinion and deepens inequality in bureaucratic decisions. While research has addressed strategies to reduce administrative bias, the potential of media literacy interventions remains underexplored. By synthesizing research on bureaucratic discrimination and communication, this study argues that media literacy interventions can mitigate media-induced biases about immigration. Since the intervention provides strategies for street-level bureaucrats to critically assess immigration-related news and recognize stereotypes, I expect it to increase caseworkers’ awareness of biases, and, as a result, lead to fairer decisions regarding ethnic minority clients.To investigate these dynamics empirically, I conducted a preregistered, representative survey experiment in November 2024 with 550 street-level bureaucrats from 35 of 405 German job centers. First, participants are randomly assigned to the intervention, presenting two contrasting newspaper articles on the same migration study: one framing immigration negatively and the other offering a more neutral perspective. These articles are then discussed by two media experts, followed by reflection questions. Second, I measure bureaucratic decision-making with a conjoint experiment involving choices related to job placement services. The results show that the media literacy training significantly increases awareness of media bias and reduces discriminatory behavior: Job center caseworkers become less likely to disapprove a job training for individuals with Romanian nationality. These findings highlight media literacy as a practical tool to promote fairness in welfare offices.","Keywords: Bureaucratic discrimination, unemployment benefits, media literacy intervention, immigration, survey experiment","Stefanie Rueß","Stefanie Rueß",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universität KonstanzZeppelin Universität",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0644_2686_0050.html","The geography of climate attitudes","This study examines geographic divides in attitudes towards climate change and climate action in Europe. While a wealth of scholarship has demonstrated how urban dwellers’ electoral choices and societal attitudes considerably diverge from their rural counterparts, we still know much less about whether -- and if so, how -- citizens’ environmental attitudes and policy preferences are spatially polarized. On the one hand, rural residents may be more skeptical of and opposed to governments’ efforts to halt the climate crisis: recent years have witnessed such measures grow increasingly contentious and politicized, with their staunchest advocates (the greens) and opponents (the radical right) drawing their support from citizens on opposing ends of the urban-rural axis. Rural regions also tend to bear a disproportionate proportion of the costs of climate action, whereas urban agglomerations reap its (diffuse) benefits. On the other hand, environmental concerns and demand for action might be more pronounced in rural regions: not only are these areas the most impacted by climate change, but their residents are also typically strongly embedded within, and attached to, their surrounding environment. Drawing on longitudinal public opinion data and conjoint experiments fielded in Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and England, we argue and demonstrate that rural and urban populations hold largely similar attitudes towards the environment and climate action: both groups express equally high levels of concern over the environment, and favor policies that benefit their respective places of residence. This study offers novel insights into environmental politics and the spatial polarization of political preferences.","Keywords: climate change, environment, geographic polarization, public opinion, green transition","Pauliina Patana","Quinton Mayne","Harvard Kennedy School","Pauliina Patana","Georgetown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Harvard Kennedy School","Georgetown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I examine the political effects of the withdrawal of in-person private services and argue that this process represents a new dimension of economic transformation that shapes voter behavior. Using a novel dataset on bank branches in Spain, I analyze how their closures - largely driven by the transition to digital banking - affect support for populist parties. Unlike conventional studies that emphasize direct economic hardship, I explore how changes in the availability of bank branches fuels perceptions of abandonment and restricts access to essential services, both of which can profoundly impact political preferences. To isolate the causal effect, I leverage the exogenous acquisition of Banco Popular by Banco Santander, which led to the closures of 93\% of Banco Popular branches. Results show that these closures are significantly associated with an increase in support for Podemos, Spain's left-wing populist party. Further analysis demonstrates that these effects are more pronounced in rural and smaller areas. These findings reveal that structural economic transformations not only reshape local economies but also shift political preferences toward populist parties.","Keywords: populism, globalization","David Vilalta","David Vilalta",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I argue and show that this relationship has primarily been tested on industrialized Western democracies that often expanded education prior to democratization. Using the case of India, I leverage the assignment rules for the expansion of education in India in a regression discontinuity design and show that the expansion of education can, under certain circumstances, cause citizens to disengage from the political process and become more distrusting. Since the mid-1980s, the Indian Government has rapidly expanded access to education. As a result, India has achieved near-universal enrollment in education, previously a pox on India's social development record. I use several household survey panels to show that although educational attainment has increased, those induced into higher levels of education are more distrustful of public institutions and less likely to participate in politics. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with actors involved in the expansion of education, I then show how the form of expansion has downstream consequences for political effects that policy-makers and legislators should account for when designing public policy.","Keywords: Political economy of development, South Asia, Development, Education, Regression Discontinuity","Emmerich Davies","Emmerich Davies",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Brown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While previous research has emphasized the limited state capacity to enforce environmental regulations, we show that entrenched social hierarchies, particularly caste-based inequalities, significantly influence patterns of noncompliance. Triangulating evidence from village-level census records, satellite data on farm fires and meteorological data on air flow and pollutant concentration, we find that the prevalence of farm fires is notably higher where social inequality is more pronounced, and lower in villages where upper-caste groups are numerically dominant. We propose two mechanisms linking inequality to poor policy implementation. First, in villages where few upper-caste elites monopolize landholdings, we find fewer instances of administrative interventions to stop farm fires, suggesting that these powerful actors may actively impede effective policy enforcement. Second, in more socially homogeneous communities, we find greater use of shared resources, which may mitigate the incentives to adopt destructive practices, thereby reducing stubble burning. Our study underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing underlying social dynamics to inform more nuanced policy approaches when confronting environmental challenges.","Keywords: Environmental compliance, state capacity, India, air pollution, social inequality","Ankita Barthwal","Ankita Barthwal","University of Oslo","Sahil Gill","World Bank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","World Bank",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0648_0035_0362.html","Three Roads to a Coup","On the ground, all coups share similar features. A group of military officers, or other elites, attempt to capture key strategy points and arrest the incumbent leader. Yet, the motivation behind a coup can differ significantly. Using a series of formal models, we identify three sets of circumstances that lead to coup attempts. First, when there is mass discontent with the regime and the elites fear losing their privileged position, they act to preempt a revolution. Second, when a leader underprovides for her supporters, the coalition of backers depose her and replace her in expectation of being better rewarded by her successor. Third, and perhaps most counterintuitively, coups are precipitated by leaders who overprovide rewards for their supporters. A global game model of institutional changes identifies such overprovision of rewards as a precursor to leader led attempts to purge and contract the coalition. Current elites use coups to preempt being purged.  Using corruption as a measure of coalition rewards, the empirical analyses find that coups are most likely when 1) there is a heighten and growing level of mass protest; 2) leaders are under-providing their supporters with rewards; and, 3) when leaders provide more rewards than anticipated given economic and political conditions. The latter conditions also coincide with circumstances where purges and contractions in the winning coalition are likely.","Keywords: coups; instability; leader survival","Alastair Smith","Alastair Smith",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that a) +1pp of economic growth is as preferred as a 10% increase in tax progressivity; b) those who care about growth and about progressivity are not the same people. Second, we identify that there is aversion to increasing taxes, driven by aversion to paying taxes. This depends on the purpose: education and cash transfers justify it (BR, ES); or lowering consumption taxes and debt (US). Third, we identify that progressivity preferences are driven by preferences for low tax rates for low incomes.We estimate the heterogenous preferences depending on trust in the government and also on political ideology.

"abstract_0650_2493_0244.html","State Aid in Times of Crisis – How Did Fixed Cost Grants Help Firms to Cope with COVID-19?","The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated an unprecedented global economic crisis, compelling governments to implement various support programs to stabilize economies. This study investigates the impact of fixed cost grants under Germany's largest COVID-19 financial aid program, Corona Bridging Aid III (UBH III), on post-COVID firm performance. Utilizing a unique dataset, which includes detailed grant disbursement information and firm-level financial data, this research examines the relationship between the approved funding amount and key performance indicators such as sales, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), cash flow, equity ratio, and employment. The analysis reveals a negative correlation between the volume of approved funding and post-COVID firm performance. Specifically, higher funding amounts are associated with slower recovery in terms of sales, EBIT, and cash flow. This trend is particularly pronounced in 2021, with the negative effects diminishing but still present in 2022. The findings suggest that while the grants helped firms stabilize to some extent, they were insufficient to fully offset the losses incurred during the pandemic. Additionally, the study finds no significant relationship between the funding amount and employment levels, indicating that the grants were effective in preventing layoffs. The results exhibit considerable heterogeneity across industries and firm sizes. The study also explores the role of digitalization investments, finding only slight evidence that such investments positively influenced recovery. These findings underscore the need for more tailored government support programs that consider industry-specific and firm-specific characteristics to enhance the efficiency of public funds allocation during economic crises.","Keywords: Government support, Public subsidies, Grants, Crisis, COVID-19","Nadine Weuschek","Nadine Weuschek",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Signal detection analysis revealed that optimal encoding occurred when facts were proximal to related jokes, particularly when related facts were presented before jokes, outperforming the presentation of facts without jokes and facts proximal to unrelated jokes. These findings underscore the potential of comedic news to enhance political knowledge acquisition through humor, which is especially relevant in the context of rising media skepticism and news avoidance.","Keywords: comedic news, knowledge acquisition, political satire","Lucía Cores-Sarría","Julia R.

I argue that this approach overlooks the critical interaction between content and network structure, which fundamentally shapes communication dynamics by determining both the spread and impact of information. To address this gap, I analyse over 1.5 million tweets posted by politicians and news media in the United States between 2015 and 2020, examining both intra- and inter-party variations. Using supervised machine learning to measure polarisation levels and unsupervised topic modelling to identify key discourses, I apply exponential random graph models to directed social networks to explore online interactions.

"abstract_0653_1379_0416.html","Pulling the rug out from under the feet? Internet shutdowns and the spread of protest","What is the effect of Internet shutdowns on the spread of mass dissent? Over the last decade, there has been a noticeable surge in Internet shutdowns as a means to contain dissent and unrest. However, systematic cross-national evidence on their ‘desired’ chilling effects on mobilization remains scarce with a few single case studies indicating that shutdowns affect the pattern of protest diffusion. Our argument centers around varying costs of protest organization incurred through the disruption of electronic communication tools, depending on the protest’s stage and the shutdown timing in a locality. Well-established and ongoing protests exhibit a greater ability to cope with the loss of digital infrastructure. This stands in contrast to those in earlier stages of mobilization, where local organizing structure are still evolving. To test this argument, we examine protests in Africa between 2016-23 in a longitudinal setup and focus on full Internet shutdowns that pose a hard case for circumvention. Our findings reveal limited effects on ongoing protest; nevertheless, full shutdowns are associated with a notable shift in the spatial diffusion pattern, preventing new locations from initiating protests, thereby limiting the spread of dissent across cities. The paper offers important insights into the digital regime tactics employed to govern domestic dissent and protest mobilization. Assessing the effects of Internet shutdown on the changes in spatial spread of protests also have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of protest containment, potentially influencing the logistics and organization of state repression.","Keywords: internet shutdown, protest, Africa, digital repression","Fabiola Schwarz","Fabiola Schwarz","Hochschule für Politik / Technical University of Munich"," Katrin Paula","Hochschule für Politik / Technical University of Munich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hochschule für Politik / Technical University of Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the use of decrees does not directly enhance satisfaction with the government’s performance, it does shape perceptions of governmental efficiency and responsiveness. The research underscores the strategic use of decrees to frame issues as urgent, raising concerns about the potential balance shift from the legislative branch in favor of the executive. The findings offer insights relevant to legislative dynamics in parliamentary systems but also to a larger research agenda concerned with democratic backsliding in mature democracies.","Keywords: legislative strategy, suvery experiment, executive action, democratic backsliding, political communication","Umberto Platini","Umberto Platini",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0655_2366_0571.html","Political Trust and Support for Democracy Among Migrant Groups","Despite centuries of human migration, little is known about the political attitudes of those who migrate. As our understanding of political trust and the rise of distrust continue to develop, and the share of residents with a migration background increases in many European countries, it is timely to consider the interaction of these trends. How does a history of migration affect political trust and democratic attitudes among different groups and in different contexts? To address this question, I combine existing over-sampled survey data collected in several countries, including France, Germany, and the Netherlands, and combine it with original survey data collected as part of the ActEU project, a Horizon Europe-funded study of political trust in 10 EU countries. Recent studies find that political attitudes result from early socialisation and change little over time, particularly with regard to political trust. Others find evidence of Euroscepticism, low turnout, and a lack of political participation among some migrant groups in some European countries, potential indicators of political distrust. My research therefore contributes to two strands of research to address the stability of trust attitudes and demonstrate their presence or absence among migrant groups. The results illustrate the differences and similarities between the attitudes of minority and majority groups in different contexts, and identify the factors which change or strengthen political trust and support for democracy.","Keywords: migration, political trust, democratic satisfaction, political attitudes, survey data","Alex Hartland","Alex Hartland",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Saarland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While surveys across Europe indicatea surge in far-right support among the youth (Faiola & Fernandes Martins, 2024), little isknown about the causes of that surge. Popular explanations tend to emphasize the economic grievances of the young people (Henley & Sauer, 2023), drawing on the more general research on economic insecurity fueling the radical right. However, those theories have not yet been put to a causal test on young voters.A rich body of literature contributed to explaining the emergence of far-right populism(e.g., Berman, 2021; Margalit et al., Nd; etc.) Theories of far-right voting boom tend to pit cultural explanations (e.g., Mutz, 2018) against economic ones (e.g., Cavaillé and Ferwerda, 2023). While some recent contributions combine two explanations (e.g., Cremaschi, Bariletto, & De Vries, 2023; Rhodes-Purdy et al., 2021), these frameworks do not consider whether economic or cultural mechanisms work similarly for different social groups.In this study, we aim to test theories of support for the far-right on a sample with a large proportion of young voters using a survey experiment, which provides extra leverage of causal identification. The research employs a two-wave online survey targeting approximately 6,000 respondents in France, Germany, and Italy during the 2024 European elections, with a focus on young people (under 35). The survey experiment uses a series of vignettes to examine preregistered hypotheses regarding the effects of economic insecurity, immigration, and cultural discontent on political attitudes.","Keywords: populism, youth, far-right, voting, Europe","Kevin Arceneaux","Konstantin Bogatyrev","Bocconi University","Catherine De Vries","Bocconi University","Kevin Arceneaux","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi University","Sciences Po",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0657_1544_1238.html","Economic policy measures' role in firms' financial resilience: determinants of corporate insolvency across European jurisdictions.","Research on the 2008-2014 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of creating a generalized model to predict corporate insolvency, consistent with prior literature. Analyses of ratios associated with insolvency risk revealed significant cross-country variations concerning corporate mortality rates. This variability stemmed from two main factors: the divergent interests of financial creditors influenced by jurisdictional differences, and the political, legal, and economic measures adopted to mitigate the crisis. These factors significantly impacted companies' economic stability, as reflected in their mortality rates during the crisis.Identifying external factors affecting insolvency outcomes remains challenging due to limitations in data availability across countries, sectors, and firm sizes. These limitations hinder the establishment of time series data for representative analysis. To address these issues, this research leverages data from EUROSTAT and BACH (Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonized) to analyze the relationships between various factors and business mortality rates across Europe.Building on this framework, the present study examines the impact of economic policies implemented by the European Union to counter the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it evaluates whether these policies reduced business closures or facilitated a more efficient market adjustment by supporting viable firms' continuity while enabling less viable firms to exit the market. This analysis provides insight into the effectiveness of policy measures in fostering economic resilience during crises and contributes to the broader understanding of insolvency dynamics in varying economic contexts.","Keywords: Economic policies, Financial crisis, Corporate insolvency, Business mortality rates, COVID-19 pandemic","Gustavo Calvo Cruz","Gustavo Calvo Cruz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Francisco de Vitoria",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While this inequality is commonly attributed to women's lower political interest in turn shaped by national political contexts, our analysis of Spain reveals a more nuanced picture.Using European Election Study (EES) data from Spain (2009, 2014, 2019 and 2024), we investigate conflicting findings in existing literature regarding supranational differences in voter turnout. Although traditional explanatory factors such as political interest, internal political efficacy, and political knowledge exhibit gender differences, our findings suggest these variables do not substantially explain voting behavior disparities in Spain. Contrary to expectations, we find no overall gender gap in Spanish voter turnout. However, significant disparities emerge within specific demographics: younger voters, those with intermediate political interest, and ideological centrists display notable gender-based differences in electoral participation.Our findings further reveal that Spain's political fragmentation—marked by emerging parties and the breakdown of the two-party system—has predominantly mobilized men rather than women voters. We attribute this pattern to the absence of strong gendered political affiliations, persisting even in parties featuring women in prominent electoral positions.","Keywords: electoral behavior, gender gap, European elections, political participation, Spain","Paula Zuluaga","Alejandro Tirado Castro","Spanish Research Council, IPP (CSIC)","Paula Zuluaga","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)","Marta Fraile","Spanish Research Council, IPP (CSIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Spanish Research Council, IPP (CSIC)","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I introduce EuroParlBase, an automated, linked database of annotated European Parliament data, covering a period of over 25 years from 1999 to today. At its core, EuroParlBase features individual-level data on parliamentary activities, such as voting, speechmaking, and attendance, supplemented by data on Members of the European Parliament and plenary sittings. An accompanying R package offers easy access to the database, and additional identifiers allow for linkage to other core political science data sets.

"abstract_0660_2007_1530.html","Trading democracy for security? How democratic concerns influence support for militarization of law enforcement","Using the military to fight organized crime and restore public security is an increasingly common strategy adopted in countries plagued by high levels of violence, especially in Latin America. Although militarizing security is widely perceived as an effective strategy, it can erode fundamental democratic principles and institutions. Are people willing to trade long-term democratic stability with short-term security? We address this question in the context of Ecuador, where violent crime has recently shaken the country. In April 2024 President Daniel Noboa called for a referendum to approve a series of constitutional reforms to give the military a more active role. The week before the referendum, we conducted a nationwide survey experiment in which we made respondents aware of the possible adverse effects of militarization. We find that reminding people that the militarization of security can undermine the rule of law or increase the chances of an executive coup decreases support for this approach to security. This reduction holds even when respondents are explicitly told that militarization has been proven effective in reducing violence. These findings suggest that people are unwilling to trade long-term democratic principles for short-term security, even during a security crisis.To investigate further the trade-off between short-term security and long-term democratic stability, in spring 2025, we plan to replicate the study in three additional countries in Latin America that vary in terms of crime levels and democratic history. We will present the preliminary results at the EPSA conference.","Keywords: crime, democracy, violence, Latin America","Davide Morisi","Juan Masullo","University of Milan","Davide Morisi","Leiden University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Milan","Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper examines the left-authoritarian voters, a significant yet underrepresented group that combines support for economic redistribution with conservative cultural preferences. Despite their prevalence, these voters often lack political outlets and disproportionately support right-authoritarian parties, creating a unique ""representational puzzle"" in Latin America.Using data from the 2023 AmericasBarometer (LAPOP) and the Parliamentary Elites in Latin America (PELA) survey from the University of Salamanca, we map the ideological positions of voters and parties across 13 countries. Our analysis reveals a significant ideological misalignment, with 27.5% of left-authoritarian voters aligning with right-authoritarian parties, prioritizing authoritarian cultural values over economic preferences. Furthermore, left-authoritarian parties, where they exist, struggle to reduce ideological distances with voters, particularly on cultural dimensions like gender and identity issues.These findings challenge the dominant single-dimensional narrative of Latin American politics and highlight the ""unmet demand"" for left-authoritarian representation. This study underscores the need to reconsider party strategies and ideological realignments to better represent the diversity of voter preferences in the region.","Keywords: Left-Authoritarianism, Representation, Political Alignment, Voter Behavior, Spatial Competition","Emma Turiño González","Emma Turiño González","University of Salamanca","María del Mar Martínez Rosón","University of Salamanca","Herbert Kitschelt","Duke University","Philipp Rehm","Johns Hopkins University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Salamanca","Duke University","Johns Hopkins University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0662_2486_1518.html","Can Public Opinion Polls Legitimize Pariah Parties?","Previous research has shown that public opinion polls can be crucial in shaping voter behavior and political discourse. While polls inform voters and political elites about public preferences, they may also distort democratic processes by legitimizing and normalizing controversial political actors. This paper addresses this underexplored effect by investigating whether polls can legitimize previously stigmatized parties in voters’ eyes.Focusing on the case of far-right parties, we theorize that increasing polling support for pariah parties signals legitimacy to voters, potentially enhancing these parties' acceptance and electoral appeal. To test this hypothesis, we combine two complementary analyses. First, using a novel dataset of over 250,000 polling values from 32 OECD countries, we employ trend detection techniques to demonstrate that far-right parties are disproportionately associated with prolonged upward polling trends. These findings suggest a possible self-fulfilling prophecy effect, whereby polling trends legitimize these parties. Second, we directly investigate polls’ influence through a survey experiment conducted in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Exposing respondents to different polling trends, we examine how these trends affect respondents’ perceived legitimacy and voting intentions toward pariah versus mainstream parties.This study advances our understanding of the complex role of public opinion polls in modern democracies. We shed light on a so far neglected factor potentially driving the normalization and rise of pariah parties. This research underscores the critical role of opinion polls in shaping democratic resilience and highlights the need for reflection on their broader implications for democratic politics.","Keywords: Public Opinion Polls, Pariah Parties, Far Right, Radical Right, Normalization","Werner Krause","Werner Krause",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Potsdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, as resurgent autocratizing forces challenge democratic norms and practices around the world, rights activists are increasingly confronting contentious and uncertain conditions in which to advocate for fundamental freedoms. In this paper, we focus on an often overlooked dimension of democratic backsliding as it affects human rights activists: The role of international donors and networks. Qualitative and quantitative studies have found that grassroot rights activists are more likely to succeed when they can partner with international organizations and transnational networks. These international ties provide parallel, though distinct, mechanisms for bringing about change. Activists can enhance their capacity to influence government behavior by activating transnational advocacy networks to ramp up foreign pressure. Where news media are not objective or independent, international networks can provide an alternate mechanism for information diffusion in allowing a country’s citizens to become aware of systematic rights violations. But how do international networks and donors respond to the challenges of autocratization and new legal restrictions?

Leveraging the natural experiment created by the 1815-1860 border separating France from the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, I employ a spatial discontinuity design to estimate the political legacy of these distinct paths, characterized by different exposure to the 1851 political repression against Republicans. The results indicate that communes remaining in France during this period have a persistent preference for left-wing candidates, which is driven by limited cross-border population mixing during higher education and at work. Archival data on arrest reports reveal that the 1851 political repression increased abstention rates. Further analysis suggests the repression’s long-term effects stem from its impact on local political demand and supply, as well as a contraction in the Republican activist network.","Keywords: Economic History, Political Economy","Antoine Boucher","Antoine Boucher",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Göttingen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores methodologies designed to explicitly model all climate “policy parameters.” By integrating Bayesian priors, we regularize the estimation model, incorporating additional information to ensure that only policies meeting a certain threshold of evidence are considered. At the same time, by employing propensity score matching we ensure causal identification in a context of scarce data with respect to the number of parameters to estimate, which constitutes a methodological challenge.Applying our methodology to the analysis of 47 different climate policy measures in 40 countries over 32 years in four policy sectors (1,737 individual policies), we identify those policies being consistently effective under various contextual conditions and examine their emission reduction potential in greater detail. Our findings provide decision-makers with insights into the most likely effective policy measures for achieving emission reductions and equip scholars with an innovative tool for evaluating policies within the context of expanding policy portfolios.","Keywords: Bayesian estimation, Causal identification, climate policy, matching, observational methods","Xavier Fernández-i-Marín","Xavier Fernández-i-Marín","Universitat de Barcelona (UB)","Markus Hinterleitner","Université de Lausanne","Christoph Knill","LMU Munich","Yves Steinebach","University of Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat de Barcelona (UB)","Université de Lausanne","LMU Munich","University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in an era marked by anti-establishment sentiments and demands for political renewal, seniority may no longer provide unambiguous advantages. Recent research highlights the growing electoral appeal of young, inexperienced (male) candidates, yet little is known about how politicians themselves perceive the role of seniority. This paper investigates whether politicians consider seniority to be an advantage or disadvantage in nomination processes and examines the factors shaping these perceptions. We draw on data on how politicians describe seniority in open-ended survey questions and on a survey experiment both embedded in the Norwegian Panel of Representatives (PER), to study the interplay of political career stages, gender and ideology in shaping views of seniority and its advantages. By considering the ""internalist view"" of politicians, the analysis contributes to our understanding of meso- and individual-level factors perceived as influencing candidate selection. The findings reveal nuanced and intersectional patterns in the perceived advantages of seniority versus newcomer status.  By analyzing how political actors interpret and navigate the dynamics of seniority and newness, the study contributes a new perspective on candidate selection and elite behavior offering critical insights into perceived and structural barriers shaping representation in times of political flux.","Keywords: seniority, newness, gender, representative survey , survey experiment , intersectionality","Francesca Feo","Francesca Feo","University of Bergen","Ida-Elise Seppola Asplund","University of Bergen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bergen","University of Bergen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am particularly interested in whether state efforts to reduce GBV shift public opinion about stigma in contexts of impunity. In this project, I rely on the policy feedback effect literature in political science to argue that anti-GBV policies can lead to perceptions among the public that there is less stigma around GBV, especially when credible messengers diffuse awareness about these efforts to the public. To test these arguments, I collect original survey experiments from Mexico and Guatemala.

"abstract_0668_2455_0052.html","Pathways, barriers, and alternatives to green extractivism in Europe: Insights from survey experiments in Germany and Spain","Rising demand for lithium-ion batteries to decarbonize mobility and energy sectors has significantly increased lithium extraction. Since current production is geographically concentrated in the Global South, several European countries have domestic extraction plans to ensure supply security, higher environmental standards, and local economic benefits amidst rising geopolitical rivalry over decarbonization technology supply chains. Yet plans for domestic lithium extraction have been met with widespread public opposition in European countries. Little is known about potential drivers of this opposition, including concerns about environmental degradation, procedural and distributive justice, or the inherent contradiction of exploiting the planet to save it. Even less is known about which alternatives to domestic lithium mining extraction-opposed but climate-concerned individuals are willing to accept, such as reducing personal mobility and energy consumption. Assessing the relative significance of presumed opposition drivers is important to understand whether mitigating resource governance policies could ensure majority support for European lithium extraction, or whether a more fundamental rejection of green extractivism necessitates a rethinking of the extractivist premise of technology-based decarbonization and a re-orientation towards alternative approaches to climate change mitigation.Leveraging a survey-embedded conjoint experiment and adaptive conjoint analysis fielded in Germany and Spain, we aim to assess to what extent resource governance policies that address various opposition drivers affect public support for lithium extraction in European countries, and which alternatives to decarbonization based on domestically extracted resources opposed individuals prefer. The results of our research can help assess the political feasibility of European lithium extraction and, more generally, technology-based decarbonization.","Keywords: Green extractivism, Critical minerals, Technology-based decarbonization, Degrowth, Political feasbility","Clara Brügge","Clara Brügge","ETH Zürich, Switzerland"," Thomas Bernauer","ETH Zürich, Switzerland","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zürich, Switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0670_2205_0361.html","The temporal dynamics of anti-government protests and security force insubordination","The outcome of anti-government protests in authoritarian contexts has been shown to heavily depend on state security forces’ willingness to engage in repression on the incumbent’s orders. In explaining security force (dis)obedience in the face of mass protests, previous research has mainly focused on conditions that are time-invariant within each protest episode, such as the long-term relationship between the regime and its security forces. This, however, leaves under-explained why security forces often change course during a single protest episode. Against this backdrop, the paper proposes a game-theoretic account of security force disobedience that highlights the role of (changing) on-the-ground protest dynamics in shaping security force behaviour via expectations. Specifically, I argue that an increase in the perceived strength of the opposition relative to the regime, as reflected e.g. in a growing number, size and geographical spread of protest events, increases subsequent disobedience chances. The argument is assessed using existing day-level data on protest events alongside original data on disobedience events (coded alternatively from secondary sources or news media reports), across authoritarian countries in the past two decades. The proposed informational pathway will specifically be tested by examining effect moderation by levels of media freedom. The findings highlight the need to move beyond primarily structural accounts of security force (dis)obedience during regime crises and to more explicitly take into account these actors’ changing informational environment, and suggests examining more systematically the different ways in which static conditions may interact with more volatile protest dynamics in shaping security force behaviour.","Keywords: protest, security force disobedience, temporal conflict dynamics, time-to-event data","Julia Nennstiel","Julia Nennstiel",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To overcome these identification issues, we use the novel partially pooled synthetic control method, which constructs a synthetic control group based on the pre-treatment imbalance for each treated state and across all treated units.

The effect of labelling false social media posts in Brazil, India and the UK","Although studies have typically found that exposing people to factchecks can help combat misinformation, the effectiveness of labelling—the strategy used by the most widely used social networks—is less clear. Using online survey experiments conducted in Brazil, India, and the UK (N=1000 in each country), we find that: (i) the effectiveness of labels in reducing the perceived accuracy and likelihood of sharing false coronavirus information varies by country, with stronger effects in India and negligible effects in the UK; (ii) individuals with high levels of conspiracist ideation and trust in social media are more likely to perceive false information as accurate and express intentions to share it; however, (iii) labels are neither significantly more nor less effective for these groups. These findings suggest that while labelling false posts can “move the needle” in addressing misinformation, the effects are modest compared to fact checks and may be context-dependent.

"abstract_0673_2039_1541.html","Can We Work Together? How Political Polarization Undermines Cooperation in a Cross-Country Behavioral Experiment","A major concern regarding polarization is whether its effects can spill over beyond the political realm and affect our everyday interactions, compromising our ability to work together and collaborate in situations where both sides can achieve mutual gains. This paper investigates how affective polarization influences cooperation across political divides through a behavioral experiment conducted in the United States, Brazil, and Spain. Participants were asked to engage asynchronously in a simple one-shot task: converting into capital letters either a salad recipe or a political text written by another participant. The experiment manipulates several factors: whether the other participant supports the respondent’s most liked or disliked political party, the type of text (political or apolitical), and the rewards for cooperation (altruistic, individualistic, or a contribution to a public good). The results consistently show that cooperation decreases substantially when participants are informed that their partner supports their most disliked political party. This negative effect is observed across all three countries, although its magnitude varies. However, the detrimental effect of polarization on cooperation is mitigated, though not eliminated, when collaboration contributes to a public good. Among those who choose to cooperate, we also find that task quality improves with material rewards but declines when political texts are involved. These findings demonstrate that the effects of affective polarization extend beyond political behavior to influence fundamental social interactions, while also identifying factors that mitigate the extent to which partisan animosity undermines cooperation. Understanding these dynamics is critical for fostering collaboration in increasingly polarized societies.","Keywords: Political polarization, Cooperation, Behavioral experiment, Cross-country experiment, Partisan animosity","Ignacio Jurado, Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Sandra León","Ignacio Jurado","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Albert Falcó-Gimeno","Universitat de Barcelona","Sandra León","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Universitat de Barcelona","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite its importance, the conceptualization and operationalization of the vote of no confidence remains underdeveloped. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing the vote of no confidence within a broader framework of confidence relations, which also includes the votes of investiture and confidence. It then operationalizes it, identifying categorical institutional indicators of the parliamentary process and uniting them into an index variable for the overall procedural process. Empirically, the study examines 20 parliamentary democracies to test the developed indicators and identify patterns in the institutional design of no-confidence votes. The results of the empirical analysis show a low internal consistency in the proposed index variable for the vote of no confidence—measured through Cronbach’s alpha—which poses a common issue in institutional comparative studies, especially in small-N comparative research. While low alpha scores are typically seen as a normal methodological limitation, and substantive significance can justify the continued use of such variables, if the final index variable fails to accurately capture the phenomenon and merely averages its indicators, it may undermine the variable’s applicability and reliability in future research. This paper engages with this methodological issue, offering solutions for balancing theoretical validity and empirical reliability. The study contributes to ongoing debates about measurement in institutional research and provides a refined approach for analyzing parliamentary dynamics, with potential applications in cross-national studies of legislative-executive relations.","Keywords: Comparative Politics, Parliaments, Institutions, Legislative-Executive Relations, Vote of No Confidence","Gaya Stav Sigavi","Gaya Stav Sigavi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0675_2475_0568.html","How Biased Police Reporting Shapes Misperceptions of Out-Group Crime","We investigate a key paradox in Western democracies: even though objective crime rates are stable or declining, public fears about crime—particularly crime attributed to immigrants and ethnic minorities—are rising. These fears drive support for far-right populism and anti-immigrant sentiment. While prior research emphasizes the roles of the news media and far-right campaigns in shaping misperceptions about crime, we focus on a previously understudied factor: biased police reporting of out-group crimes. We argue that the police play a central role in shaping public perceptions of crime, as both the media and far-right actors rely on police-provided information to report and politicize out-group crime. By deciding which incidents to report and which perpetrator characteristics—such as nationality or ethnicity—to disclose, the police occupy a causally prior position in shaping crime narratives. We use GPT-4 to extract information from over two million German police press statements (2014–2024), verifying its performance against human coders. Using this data, we conduct the most extensive analysis of police reporting behavior to date. Our findings reveal that the German police overreport crime attributed to immigrants and ethnic minorities by a factor of ten, indicating substantial bias in reporting practices. In a second step, we evaluate how biased police reporting impacts public perceptions of crime and the formation of negative stereotypes about out-groups. Our study underscores the police's key role as information gatekeepers in shaping public crime discourse and highlights the urgent need for transparency and accountability in reporting practices to counter the spread of misperceptions that fuel anti-immigrant sentiment.","Keywords: Crime Reporting, Anti-immigrant sentiment, Police behavior, Public perceptions, Large language models","Violeta Haas","Violeta Haas","IAST, Toulouse School of Economics","Sascha Riaz","European University Institute (EUI)","Tobias Roemer","University of Oxford","Ashrakat Elshehawy","Stanford University","Arun Frey","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","IAST, Toulouse School of Economics","European University Institute (EUI)","Stanford University","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Examining the Electoral Strategies of Far-Right Parties","The rise of far-right parties has been extensively studied, yet less attention has been given to the specific activities these parties organize to expand their popularity and mobilize voters. This study examines the case of Golden Dawn in Greece and adopts a novel approach to understand how localized activities influenced electoral outcomes. Relying on computational methods, we extract activity-related articles from the party’s official website, parse the documents to classify activities by type (e.g., commemorative events, demonstrations), geolocate the activities, and map them to the municipalities where they occurred. These data are combined with municipal-level election results to assess the impact of different activity types on changes in Golden Dawn’s electoral vote share during four elections between 2012 and 2015. Socio-demographic factors, such as immigrant population percentages and unemployment rates, are incorporated to control for their influence on vote share. By focusing on nonviolent activities, this study addresses inconsistencies in the classification of far-right mobilization strategies and explores how specific localized engagement patterns contribute to electoral gains at the municipal level.","Keywords: far-right mobilization, electoral outcomes, localized activities, computational social science","Elena Karagianni","Constantine Boussalis","Trinity College Dublin","Elena Karagianni","Trinity College Dublin","Lamprini Rori","National and Kapodistrian University of Athens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trinity College Dublin","National and Kapodistrian University of Athens",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ricardian equivalence (Barro, 1974) states that an increase in government debt will cause people to expect increased taxes in the future, and hence implies lower investment. We test whether entrepreneurs' expectations about the future and their investment change in response to public debt. We do this by using three survey experiments as well as historical data on the real investment decisions of entrepreneurs. We find that entrepreneur's investment plans are highly sensitive to public debt and that historically ""public debt averse"" entrepreneurs invest less in years when public debt is more salient.Our survey experiments include a conjoint analysis, where entrepreneurs are presented with potential future states of the economy (with various characteristics randomized) and asked about their investment plans, an information provision experiment where entrepreneurs are provide with either a high or low forecast of future public debt as well as a survey hypothetical, where they are asked how they would respond to the government receiving an unexpected windfall. Across all experiments, we find that entrepreneurs are highly sensitive to news about public debt, and that this is not driven by experimenter demand effects.We also link survey responses to historical investment data and find that, in years where parliament discuss public debt more, entrepreneurs who consider public debt to be a major political problem invest less.","Keywords: public debt, small business economics, Ricardian equivalence","Mikael Paaso","Mikael Paaso",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Erasmus University Rotterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0678_2142_0751.html","National or European, that is the Question: Explaining MEPs’ Voting Defection from European Party Groups in the European Parliament","What mechanisms explain the voting defection of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from their European party groups? Previous literature shows that when the ideological position of an MEP’s national party differs from that of the European party group, the national party is the primary principal that influences MEPs’ voting behaviour in the European Parliament. However, the empirical evidence is somewhat sporadic, and there has been a considerably high voting cohesion among MEPs within EP groups over time. Against this backdrop, I investigate under what conditions the greater ideological distance between national parties and EP groups leads to MEPs’ voting defection from their EP groups. Taking an issue-specific approach, I argue that the effect of ideological distance depends on the level of issue salience to national parties and proximity to European elections. Conducting a multi-level logistic regression analysis on the individual MEPs’ voting decisions in the 7th–9th European Parliament (from 2009 to 2022) across six different policy areas, I find that greater policy distance between the national party and the EP group increases the probability of an individual MEP voting against the majority of the EP group, particularly on issues that the national party prioritizes in its election manifesto. Furthermore, MEPs are more likely to defect from their EP groups when the next European Parliament elections are proximate and the ideological divergence between their two principals is more pronounced. This research has important implications for our understanding of legislative behaviour, party competition, and the politicization of Europe.","Keywords: MEP Behaviour, EP Group Cohesion, European Parliament","Eunhyea Oh","Eunhyea Oh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Essex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, similar studies on congruence in representative style or process congruence remain rare. In this paper, we contribute to extant research on the process gap by gauging the effects of different measurements of process (in)congruence—i.e., citizens’ congruence with the government, all elected representatives and MPs from their preferred party—on various measures of democratic disenchantment, namely satisfaction with the current state of democracy, support for the democratic regime, and confidence in parliament and the government. Moreover, we test political interest as a key mechanism through which the effect of the process gap should operate on democratic disenchantment. Whereas this mechanism has been established in the literature on policy incongruence and its effects on democratic disenchantment; it has yet to be examined in the case of process congruence. Hence, the present article aims not only to assess the impact of process congruence on satisfaction with democracy as well as a number of attitudes signaling citizens’ support or disenchantment towards democratic institutions, but also whether the effect of (in)congruence varies depending on their interest in politics. Finally, we examine these dynamics by drawing on longitudinal data from Portugal collected before, during, and after the eurozone crisis. This approach allows us to explore whether the economic state of a country affects the relationship between process incongruence and democratic disenchantment.","Keywords: elite, democracy, process congruence, representation","Philippe Mongrain","Philippe Mongrain","University of Antwerp","Nino Junius","University of Antwerp; Vrije Universiteit Brussel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Antwerp","Vrije Universiteit Brussel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Justificatory Mechanisms of the Diffusion of Democratic Backsliding [INTERAUTO]","Diffusion of democratic regression occurs when incidents of democratic backsliding abroad increase the likelihood and magnitude of democratic backsliding at home. We have elsewhere found strong evidence that democratic regression diffuses on a global scale. In this paper, we develop two key domestic mechanisms of the diffusion of democratic regression. We argue that observing external precedent of democratic regression emboldens anti-liberal domestic actors by making anti-liberal reform appear (1) more normatively appropriate and (2) more programmatically effective (Ambrosio 2010). The mechanisms affect both political elites and voters, increasing the electoral supply of and demand for anti-liberal reform, and ultimately the likelihood and intensity of democratic regression. We focus on elites in this paper. We provide a mixed-methods analysis to bolster our argument. We estimate Bayesian spatial-x models to show the general effect of external backsliding precedent on anti-liberal electoral supply, i.e. the number of anti-liberal electoral parties and the degree of their anti-liberalism. In qualitative and computer-assisted (LLM) text analyses of parliamentary debate and state-of-the-union type speeches of heads of government, we trace narratives of appropriateness and effectiveness of external backsliding precedent and examine whether and how the two mechanisms appear in political justifications for reform that lead to democratic regression. We compare two most-likely and most-different cases to strengthen the generalizability of the mechanisms. Preliminary findings provide support for our argument that external precedent emboldens anti-liberal domestic actors in processes of democratic regression.","Keywords: Democratic regression, democratic backsliding, diffusion, mechanisms, mixed-methods","Lisa-Marie Selvik, Alexander Schmotz","Lisa-Marie Selvik","WZB Berlin Social Science Center"," Alexander Schmotz","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"WZB Berlin Social Science Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An initial descriptive analysis sheds light on whether certain social or occupation groups – such as young, uneducated men or Catholics – were more or less likely to be (early) supporters of the Nazi regime.

Their performance varies depending on the task complexity, prompt strategy, language, and model parameters. For example, temperature is one of the most well-known parameters that could affect the reproducibility level of LLMs. In addition, there are concerns associated with using proprietary models, including limitations on reproducibility. Although open-source models offer reproducibility under controlled circumstances, they perform less effectively than closed models for several tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive benchmark to test the stability of LLMs on a complex classification task: policy agenda topics in bills and acts of Parliaments. The complexity of this task relies on using a multiclass categorisation, such as the 21 major topics of the Comparative Agendas Project, which is quite challenging for most of these models because of the high number of categories involved in the annotation. We conduct classification tasks in different languages (e.g., Dutch, English, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) and incorporate prompt variations and temperature experiments to perform ground-truth evaluations on both proprietary and open-source models such as OpenAI’s GPTs, Claude models, xAI’s Grok, Meta’s Llama recent releases like 3.3, Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5, Mistral models, among others. In sum, this paper offers a better understanding of these models’ performance for a complex task and insights into how classification routines could affect the annotation process and reproducibility.","Keywords: LLMs, GPTs, text-as-data, NLP, policy agendas","Bastián González-Bustamante","Bastián González-Bustamante",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0683_1376_1017.html","GENCAREERS: The Influence of Mental Load Priming on Politicians’ Static and Progressive Ambition","Women remain underrepresented in politics in the majority of democracies around the world. Part of this gender gap is due to not only the decision to run for office in the first place, but gender differences in  elected politicians’ desire to continue in their post (static ambition) or run for a higher office (progressive ambition). In this study, we explore one potential mechanism which could influence politicians’ static and progressive political ambition: the mental load. Women continue to take a “second shift” of unpaid labor in the household, and part of this involves not only the physical work of caring for children and relatives and taking care of other household work, but the mental work of anticipating household needs, making decisions, and monitoring progress. We argue that women politicians are more likely to carry the domestic mental load compared to men politicians, and that this added cognitive burden can reduce interest in further political ambition. To test our argument, we rely on a survey experiment fielded to local councillors in England which manipulates whether respondents are asked to think about their own domestic mental loads before answering questions about political ambition. The results offer new evidence about the relevance of household inequalities, and the often-invisible mental load, in political life.","Keywords: Mental load, political ambition, survey experiment","Anna Helgøy","Anna Helgøy","University of Oslo","Ana Weeks","University of Bath","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","University of Bath",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Social movements, domestic abuse legislation, and the Bristol Women’s Liberation Movement","Before the Women’s Liberation Movement emerged in Britain in the 1970s, domestic abuse was not on the national agenda. Intimate partner violence was treated as outside the proper scope of legal and political intervention, and police would rarely engage in ‘domestic’ disputes. In this paper, I take the anti-domestic abuse movement in Bristol, UK, as an illustrative case in successful society-led agenda setting. For the first time, I use extensive archival research, including policy documents, personal letters, and conference minutes, directly from the Bristol Women’s Library. As I show, the movement in Bristol began without state funding or resources – and even in properties that were criminalised. As the decade wore on, however, anti-domestic abuse became a decidedly mainstream position. How did this under-resourced, under-staffed, and criminalised movement manage to take domestic abuse from a marginal to mainstream issue? In this paper, I ask: how did civil society organisations place domestic abuse at the heart of the political agenda? What was the role of policy coalitions in the shifting salience of intimate partner justice? And how did legislation provide the tools for domestic abuse to be treated as a matter of public, rather than private, concern?","Keywords: Agenda setting / Gender / Domestic Violence / Politicisation","Rachel Darby","Rachel Darby",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Nuffield College, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0686_0549_0054.html","The Historical Roots of Legal Mobilization: Evidence from Land Rights Litigation in Northeast Argentina","Rural marginalized communities in the developing world, such as subsistence farmers and indigenous groups, often face threats to their land rights and access to natural resources. Large-scale land grabs, deforestation, and agrochemical drift undermine their livelihoods, even when they hold property rights. Structural barriers, including limited legal awareness and high litigation costs, often prevent these groups from defending their claims in court. However, in some regions, rural communities successfully pursue litigation to protect their land rights.This paper examines why rural litigation emerges in some areas but not others, focusing on the historical legacies of collective action. Specifically, we analyze the role of the Agrarian Leagues, a mass movement active from the 1940s to the 1970s in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, which advocated for land reform and peasant rights. We argue that in regions where the Agrarian Leagues were active, rural communities inherited (i) heightened legal consciousness and (ii) organizational skills that help them overcome barriers to litigation.We test this hypothesis using econometric and qualitative evidence from Argentina’s Northeast during 2004–2012. Combining fieldwork, archival research, and nearly 40 in-depth interviews, we construct a dataset of collective legal cases and map the historical presence of Agrarian Leagues chapters. Our findings show that historical experiences of collective action have enduring effects, equipping marginalized rural groups with the tools to navigate judicial systems and defend their land rights in contemporary settings.","Keywords: Legal mobilization, historical legacies, collective action, Latin America","Jorge Mangonnet","Sofía Berrospi","Vanderbilt University","Ezequiel González-Ocantos","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Jorge Mangonnet","Vanderbilt University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vanderbilt University","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Vanderbilt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0687_0635_0150.html","The Authoritarian Shadow of Modernization: Economic Development and Support for Illiberalism in Post-Communist Europe","What explains the survival of illiberal political preferences in former authoritarian countries? While most research has focused on repressive experiences under authoritarianism, much less attention has been paid to the systematic assessment of why citizens in former authoritarian countries maintained illiberal political preferences. This is particularly evident in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where a large share of the electorate suffered under repression, and yet continues to support more pro-authoritarian parties. Thus, I focus on policies which could have created support towards the communist regime, namely modernization. I argue that citizens which have profited from modernization under communism remain more supportive of pro-authoritarian political parties. As these citizens have experienced stronger increases in living standards compared to pre-communist times, they might be more receptive to authoritarian ideas. I use three sources of evidence. First, I present survey evidence confirming the pro-authoritarian pattern. Second, I collect fine-grained housing census data from major CEE countries to study the relationship between construction as modernization proxy and pro-authoritarian political preferences. Third, I focus on the case of Systematization in communist Romania where the regime sought to accelerate urbanization. Using a regression discontinuity design leveraging the population cutoff that has been used to allocate investments, I can identify more precisely the relationship between pro-authoritarian political preferences and communist modernization strategies. Overall, I find that modernization under communism leads to stronger pro-authoritarian preferences. This paper seeks to offer novel evidence on how pro-authoritarian preferences persist, underlining the economic foundation of political culture in post-authoritarian societies.","Keywords: Modernization, HPE, Communism, Illiberalism, CEE","Ludwig Schulze","Ludwig Schulze",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Electoral Accountability for Public Service Provision : Insights from Delhi","Public services are consistently ranked among the most significant factors influencing citizens’ evaluations of government performance. However, the scholarship on whether electoral accountability is enforced for public service delivery remains unclear in the context of low- and middle-income democracies. This paper examines the mechanisms linking public service provision to electoral accountability through the case of the Delhi state government, which has been re-elected three times on a platform prioritising public services.Drawing on original survey, experimental and ethnographic data collected during 18 months of fieldwork, the study reveals that while public service provision is significantly associated with government performance, the credit for implementing public service delivery primarily accrues to the party leadership rather than local representatives. While voters consider the overarching agenda and policy promises when evaluating party performance, local electoral accountability operates on a different rationale: The past records of an individual elected official's policy implementation play a minor role in voters’ decisions regarding their reelection. Instead, voters prioritise candidates willing and capable of effectively addressing and resolving citizens’ immediate concerns.This study advances our understanding of electoral accountability by disentangling voters’ perceptions of a party's policy agenda from their views on elected officials' constituency service. It highlights that, while public service provision informs government performance at a policy level, the selection of local officials does not adhere to programmatic criteria. Instead of choosing policy implementors, voters prefer officials who can act as mediators to the local state.","Keywords: public services, electoral accountability, India, governance","Sofie Heintz","Sofie Heintz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0690_0006_0419.html","Rebellion Mergers: Investigating the puzzle of the Forces Nouvelles","Despite increasing attention to group fluidity in multidimensional conflicts, there has been scant research into rebellion mergers as an outcome of interest. Existing theory holds that the leaders of discrete rebellions should prefer informal alliances from which they can easily defect if opportunities shift in their favour, thus only becoming willing to bear the strategic costs of a formalised merger when alternatives have been eliminated by an existential threat. In this light, the formation of the Forces Nouvelles in 2003 from three previously discrete Ivorien rebellions presents a puzzle. Not only was the balance of power frozen at the time by an internationally-upheld zone of confidence, preventing any direct military confrontation, but the power-sharing bargain outlined in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement should have heightened rivalries between rival leaders seeking to carve out a separate slice of the pie, according to extant scholarship. This paper relies on elite interviews with key rebel decision-makers to shed light on the causal processes behind merger events. Using inductive process tracing techniques, it reveals how settlement implementation failures have reputational consequences for the government, incentivising rebel leaders to join forces in response to the reduced range of bargaining outcomes, thus allowing the armed opposition to overcome commitment problems on the government side.","Keywords: Conflict transformation, rebel alliances, bargaining","Chelsea Johnson","Chelsea Johnson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Liverpool",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0691_1688_0324.html","Housing Financialization and Political Opportunism","House prices across the US have escalated, causing significant economic hardship. Politicians and the media increasingly attribute affordable housing crises to financial investors, who are accused of inflating prices, diminishing inventory, and pushing out regular homebuyers. Although investor activity has increased, we argue that the financialization narrative serves as a convenient scapegoat, diverting attention from politicians’ failures to expand the housing supply and shifting blame to Wall Street. This populist narrative is politically expedient: it appeals to the electorate at large while simultaneously protecting organized housing insiders who seek to limit supply. We provide several types of evidence in support of this argument. First, fine-grained address-level data on investor purchases reveal that neighborhoods exposed to housing financialization do not necessarily experience higher housing costs compared to unexposed areas. Second, original survey results reveal that voters across partisan lines are troubled by Wall Street’s role in the housing market, both because it undercuts the American Dream of homeownership and because it challenges the notion of housing as a right rather than a commodity. Third, analyses of local government meetings, legislative activity, and political speeches indicate that anti-investor rhetoric persists even where investor activity is limited. By combining observational data, speech and legislative evidence, and targeted survey interventions—including experiments linking respondents to local investor activity—we show how anti-financialization appeals reinforce populist sentiments and generate a self-sustaining political equilibrium that ultimately hinders the policies needed to address underlying housing shortages.","Keywords: affordable housing; financialization; political elites; inequality; public opinion","Vincent Heddesheimer","Rafaela Dancygier","Princeton University"," Vincent Heddesheimer","Princeton University"," Andreas Wiedemann","Princeton University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, we examine whether political parties in Turkey reward the campaign efforts of candidates equally, regardless of gender. Our study focuses on the unique context of the twin elections held in 2015, providing a rich dataset for analysis. We hypothesize that social media campaign efforts may have divergent effects on the renomination prospects and list positions of male and female candidates. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an extensive data collection effort, gathering biographical and political career information for 2,200 candidates. Additionally, we analyzed their social media activity on Twitter (which was rebranded as X) during the campaign period. Our preliminary findings suggest the existence of a gender penalty in Turkish politics. Counterintuitively, as the frequency of female candidates' social media campaigns increases, their prospects for renomination decrease. This trend stands in stark contrast to the experience of male candidates, for whom increased social media activity correlates positively with improved renomination prospects. ​Interestingly, our analysis did not find a statistically significant difference between female and male candidates' campaign efforts in terms of their impact on list positions. This nuanced finding suggests that while gender disparities exist in renomination prospects, they may not extend to all aspects of political advancement.","Keywords: Candidate renomination, gender, social media campaign, elections","Esra İssever Ekinci","Esra İssever Ekinci","Bilkent University","Ali Çarkoglu","Koç University","Susan Banducci","University of Birmingham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bilkent University","Koç University","University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis demonstrates that opposition legislators affiliated with Islamist ideologies are more active than other legislators in submitting queries to the government. Furthermore, they ask more questions about sensitive political topics, economic issues, and social policies often associated with Islamism. These patterns suggest that legislative seats do not co-opt Islamists into silence but instead allow them to draw attention to their agendas.

The EU is no exception in that regard. Nevertheless, the EU is also based on fundamental values as envisaged in Article 2 TEU. These core values should be common to all EU Member States and the EU as a whole. As noted by Simon Hix, ‘if the values that constitute collective identity [of democratic international communities] come under threat, we should expect the international organization to defend them’. However, political developments of the last decades have shown that even when it comes to core values such as democracy or guarantees of the rule of law, EU political actors are not necessarily as united as one would in theory expect. This article aims to explore the role Article 2 TEU played in the debates on the rule of law in EU member states. In doing so, the analysis targets the only directly elected EU institution and arguably the most vocal proponent of the EU democracy: the European Parliament. More specifically, I ask two research questions: (a) How did the MEPs frame the debates on the quality of democracy and rule of law in backsliding EU member states?; and (b) Do the MEPs consider Article 2 values as a strong legal basis or rather as a proclamatory article with a limited practical use? Qualitative content analysis is employed for analysing more than 40 EP debates that have taken place since 2004.","Keywords: Article 2 TEU, EU values, European Parliament, Rule of Law","Lukas Hamrik","Lukas Hamrik",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Masaryk University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0697_0172_0574.html","’That Could Be Me’: Fear of Sending-Country Chaos Can Drive Immigration Attitudes","Attitudes about immigration are central to political contestation around the world. Research has focused on fear of economic, cultural, and security threats. We describe a new sort of fear about immigration that can polarize attitudes: how the presence of migrants from particular countries can intensify voters’ anxiety about their own country’s future. Politics in sending countries can spark “that could be me” fears in receiving countries – that one day migrants’ experience could be their own – that they’d be forced into exile because their own country became as oppressive or chaotic as the sending country. Such fear can arise independently of perceptions that immigrants represent economic, cultural, or security threats.The Venezuelan exodus across Latin America offers a useful context for exploring our hypothesis. Countries in the region are similar culturally and economically, but vary in terms of polarization and the salience of immigration. To determine whether immigration sparks “that could be me” fears, we fielded a survey-experiment in several countries that vary across these dimensions, cueing voters to think about Venezuelans versus immigrants from elsewhere. Across countries, a large Venezuelan inflow drives economic and security fears. Yet where Venezuelan immigration is relatively insignificant but political polarization high, conservative politicians use Venezuelan immigrants to raise fears of what might happen under a future left-wing government at home. Our argument offers a novel way of thinking about immigration attitudes, particularly in terms of south-south global migration, where 'that could be me' fears are potentially quite common.","Keywords: Migration; Venezuela; Latin America; survey-experiment; polarization","Fernando Mello, Cesar Zucco","David Samuels","University of Minnesota","Fernando Mello","Universidad Carlos III","Ignacio Jurado","Universidad Carlos III","Cesar Zucco","Getulio Vargas Foundation","","","","","","","","","","","","","Getulio Vargas Foundation","Universidad Carlos III","University of Minnesota",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0698_0217_0637.html","Unpacking the Voting Gender Gap","Two facts have characterized elections in the Western world since 2016: a) a gender gap, where women vote for progressive candidates, and men for more conservative ones; b) an educational gap, as more educated people vote for the left, and less educated for the right. We claim that both phenomena are connected. In particular, we argue that the observed gender gap is, to a large extent, a consequence of the expansion of higher education, and of the fact that women overperform men in every indicator of success in higher education  ---test scores, completion rates, and others. If left-of-center parties represent educated groups, then it is natural that men who struggle in this field will feel increasingly alienated from these parties. We study this topic primarily in the United States, a country where both the gender and the educational gap deepen in the 2024 election, especially among youngsters. First, we will conduct a descriptive and correlational analysis, aiming to demonstrate that the gender gap diminishes when adjusting for education. Second, we plan to exploit university expansion, in order to grasp the causal effect of education on political attitudes.","Keywords: Voting behavior; Gender gap; Educational gap; Expansion of higher education.","Pablo Argote, Daniela Urbina","Pablo Argote","University of Southern California","Daniela Urbina","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0699_0277_0641.html","IDENT1 Strategic Alienation: The Dynamics of Group Appeals in Negative Campaigning","In this paper, we investigate how political parties employ group appeals as a strategic component of negative campaigning in their communication on social media. Although the existing literature extensively explores negative campaigning, it has paid limited attention to the mechanisms that drive specific target choices. One critical and under-researched dimension of this phenomenon is the role of group appeals—messages referencing social groups like social classes, ethnic communities, or occupational groups. Group appeals are a particularly powerful tool for parties to frame political discussions because they tap into voters’ social identities and other group-based predispositions. Through their ability to resonate with voters on a personal level, these appeals can significantly shape how voters perceive political actors and issues. By integrating group appeals into negative campaigning, parties can more effectively highlight their opponents’ failures to represent certain groups while bolstering their own connection to that group at the same time. We therefore expect that parties are more likely to attack their competitors with appeals to social groups for which they have a poor reputation of representation to strategically alienate group supporters and identifiers from their competitors. To test this theoretical expectation, we analyze Facebook and Twitter posts from political parties in the United Kingdom, focusing on the period from 2016 to 2023, and combine this data with public opinion data from the British Election Study Internet Panel. This approach enables us to systematically examine how parties leverage group-based messaging in negative campaigning to shape electoral narratives and voter perceptions.","Keywords: Negative Campaigning, Group Appeals, Social Media, Party Competition, Political Communication","Lena Maria Huber","Lena Maria Huber","MZES, University of Mannheim","Martin Haselmayer","FORESIGHT Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","MZES, University of Mannheim","FORESIGHT Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0701_0836_0755.html","Parliamentarians as “backlash mobilisers”: Climate backlash and just transition in the plenary debates of the European Parliament (2004-2024)","The 2024 European elections have seen a great surge of the Radical Right in Europe, partly attributed to a so-called “greenlash” or “climate backlash”– citizens lashing out against green policies due to their financial burden (Patterson, 2023; Sengupta, 2024; Tasch, 2024). But in order to understand citizens’ climate change attitudes we need to consider elite-led opinion formation (Merkley & Stecula, 2021). Furthermore, political actors might act as catalysts of political backlashes (so called “backlash mobilisers”)(Alter & Zürn, 2020; Freedman, 2020).This study adopts a mixed-methods approach to analyse the development of climate backlash rhetoric in the European Parliament (EP) plenary debates. Utilising an original dataset comprising of approximately 2,000 EP speeches on climate change between 2004 and 2024, this paper measures MEPs’ rhetorical engagement in backlash against climate change mitigation policies. It examines whether this rhetoric has supplanted earlier trends of climate change skepticism and whether just transition arguments have increased in response. Multinomial logistic regressions further explore individual-level and country-level factors driving these rhetorical shifts. This paper shows that climate-backlash-related rhetoric has been present in the EP since 2004 but increased during the 2019-2024 parliamentary period. Simulatenously, outright climate change denial and climate change scepticism have declined. However, there is a notable regional effect to take into account: whereas the Western European Radical Right might increasingly use climate change as a wedge issue (Dickson & Hobolt, 2024), the share of climate change sceptic arguments and climate backlash rhetoric has drastically decreased among Eastern European Radical Right MEPs.","Keywords: Climate Politics, Parliamentary Speech, European Parliament, Radical Right, Backlash","Reja Wyss","Reja Wyss",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Sociology, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0702_0890_0818.html","Group Appeals in Historical Perspective—Comparing Over 50 Years of Parties’ Election Campaign Communication with Social Groups.","Recent scholarship shows a renewed interest in how political parties connect with various social groups when communicating with voters during election campaigns. However, the scarce available data hinders our ability to gain insights into this aspect of the party-voter relationship. As questions of parties’ appeals to social groups are of high value to our examination and understanding of party behavior via-a-vis their voters, we take a significant step forward to expand available data on group appeals by presenting a new dataset focusing on a cross-national and longitudinal analysis in this paper. Covering 865 general election manifestos of all political parties that gained seats at national-level elections between 1970 and 2024 from Austria, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK, this is the first large-scale dataset to allow over time and across-country comparisons of parties’ direct and indirect appeals to social groups. Relying on a comprehensive approach to the concept of group-based appeals developed by Huber and Dolinsky (2023), the dataset is built using advanced computational text analysis methods that combine group and stance detection (positive, negative, neutral) as well as whether policy is included or not. Processing and analyzing parties’ general election manifestos reveal over-time trends in group-based appeals, showcasing within- and between-country similarities and differences in party behavior. This new dataset facilitates a better understanding of group-based appeals via a coherent conceptualization and enhances scholars’ ability to engage in comparative studies.","Keywords: Group Appeals, Party Manifestos, Election Campaigns, European Parties","Alona O.

"abstract_0704_0138_0963.html","Predicting populism: Methodological and substantive insights from supervised classification of social media data","Populism has become a prominent concept in social science. To study populism empirically, it is necessary to identify it within large, rapidly expanding text corpora that are too vast for manual analysis. In the past, a limited number of researchers have analyzed populism in social media, party manifestos, and speeches using supervised methods such as logistic regression, random forest, and BERT, with mixed results. This paper makes three key contributions. First, we systematically review previous research that has predicted populism in various contexts, highlighting the challenges in defining populism clearly and illustrating the limitations of existing definitions for classifying social media data. We then propose a clearer definition. Second, using this refined definition and a large Twitter dataset, we compare various predictive machine learning and deep learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and three LLM models—GPT-3.5-turbo, as well as finetuned versions of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The overall accuracy (correct classification rate) varies significantly, from .62 (GPT-3.5-turbo), to .85 (Random Forest), and up to .96 (finetuned GPT). Our comparison provides additional methodological insights that can be generalized to the classification of populism in different contexts and to other related concepts (e.g., in terms of classification time, cost, and model interpretability). Finally, as an ultimate test, we explore how model accuracy affects substantive conclusions on the prevalence of populism, offering insights into which modeling choices are most suitable for analyzing such data.","Keywords: populism, machine learning, classification, accuracy, bias, llm, llms","Paul C.

"abstract_0705_0091_1021.html","Household Work, Bargaining, and Women's Economic and Political Participation","How do women assert power and negotiate space within the household? Existing literature suggests that factors outside the household shape women’s empowerment – such as employment opportunities, laws that regulate the relationship between men and women, as well as societal norms. In this project, we explore how women make use of resources within the household to assert power. We argue that in settings where women's employment opportunities are limited, household labour is not just a loss of time for women. Instead, women use the allocation of different types of household tasks to pursue their own goals. Consequently, women may want to take on more of some types of household work, because these types of work will increase their decision-making capacity without having to overtly negotiate or challenge the status quo.

Do you prefer public services to be delivered in the right manner or by the right person – i.e. by a public employee that represents you? Studies on representative bureaucracy have accumulated theoretical and empirical insights about how racial and gender attributes of bureaucrats and citizens influence both the performance of bureaucracies and citizens’ perceptions of those performances. Yet the existing literature presents shortcomings that justify further studies. First, previous research shows sharply contradictory results. On the one hand, better represented administrative bodies, particularly in terms of race and gender, can lead to more positive outcomes for the represented citizen groups, such as minority citizens being better treated by minority police officers (e.g., Hong 2017), higher test scores for girls with female teachers (e.g., Meier 2019). On the other hand, some studies present opposite findings, such as an increase in racial profiling in police divisions with more minority officers (Wilkins & Williams 2008). Second, research on representative bureaucracy has predominantly focused on Anglo-Saxon contexts. We aim to contribute to this literature by exploring a highly politicized cleavage in the Basque Country, Spain: the language spoken by the public official: Basque vis-à-vis Spanish. We explore how citizens evaluate efficiency vis-à-vis representativeness in the Basque public sector employing two vignette experiments describing hypothetical scenarios in health care and law enforcement.","Keywords: representative bureaucracy, quality of government, identity, health care, police","Victor Lapuente","Victor Lapuente","University of Gothenburg","Agnes Cornell","University of Gothenburg","Georgios Xezonakis","University of Gothenburg","Xabier Barandiaran","Deusto University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","Deusto University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ""balance norm'' has been an important principle guiding journalism, emphasizing objectivity in reporting and covering opposing perspectives. However, recent changes in newsroom revenue models, staff demographics, and Trump's attacks on the mainstream media challenge this norm. This paper empirically examines how individual and political factors affect journalists' citation patterns for climate change articles in six major U.S. newspapers for 2012-2022. We construct the most comprehensive dataset of news source citations using large language models and use the DIME data to measure article slant. We extracted nearly 89,000 sources from approximately 17,000 news articles on climate change. The volume of articles on this topic increased sharply after 2018, a trend primarily driven by more liberal media outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. For the sources extracted, we categorize them into various types, including academics, bureaucrats, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. U.S. government sources. There is variation across media outlets in terms of the sources they rely on. We document how the characteristics of individual journalists correlate with source citation patterns. We collect data on journalist-level characteristics, focusing on their education and experience. Our findings reveal that journalists with less experience and elite education increasingly write articles with a greater leftward slant.

"abstract_0708_0213_1386.html","Psychological Drivers of Identity Politics Attitudes in Denmark and the United States","“Identity politics”—issues revolving around the degree to which majority groups should accommodate minority groups to respect individual or collective identities often relating to ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion—has become center of political attention causing strong ideological disagreements across countries. Interestingly, a substantial number of identity politics disagreements relate to seemingly non-political issues like product names, packaging styles, choices of influencers to promote products etc. The name of a Danish ice cream, “Giant Eskimo”, and American food brand “Uncle Ben’s” use of a Black American butler on their packaging, both drew criticism with companies viewed as disrespectful or derogatory towards specific minority groups. Despite the high prevalence of these ideologically rooted disagreements, research has not yet illuminated the psychological explanations underlying such debates. Consequently, this project generates two competing theoretical accounts suggesting that identity politics disagreements may reflect i) preferences for group-based (in)equality (as measured by Social Dominance Orientation), or ii) traditionalism and conventionalism (as measured by Rightwing Authoritarianism). We pit the two accounts against each other in three well-powered studies with Danish (NStudy1=1100; NStudy2=2000) and American (NStudy3=2600) representative samples and measure attitudes towards salient identity politics issues related to ethnic, sexual and religious minority groups. Our results provide strong and robust support that ideological disagreements about identity politics are driven by individual differences in both i) preferences for group-based (in)equality, and ii) traditionalism and conventionalism, but with the latter explanation as the substantially stronger driver. We discuss the broader theoretical and practical implications of the results.","Keywords: Identity politics; Political psychology; Ideology; Cross country comparisons.","Lasse Laustsen","Lasse Laustsen","Aarhus University"," Benedicte Grønhøj","Aarhus University"," Claire Gothreau","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0710_0737_0055.html","Winners of Transformations","The significant structural transformations in Western democracies have inspired extensive research on the political consequences for groups perceived as ""losers"" of these changes. Yet, surprisingly little attention has been directed toward the ""winners""—those who benefited from these transformations, for example through higher wages or expanded political rights. What are the political effects of acknowledging these positive changes? To explore this question, we employ a well-powered survey experiment in which respondents reflect on how their quality of life has improved over the past 30 years. Our analysis focuses on East and West Germans, two groups that experienced these transformations in different ways. While East Germans faced significant personal and professional costs during German reunification, they also saw significant improvements in political freedoms and living standards. West Germans, albeit less directly affected by reunification itself, experienced similar structural shifts over the same period. Embedded in our survey is an experiment that prompts respondents to reflect on improvements in the quality of life either of themselves, of their peers, or in relation to others. We then record a series of questions on attitudes toward democracy and populism. Our main finding is that reframing economic transformation processes in a positive way improves democratic satisfaction and support for democracy. By doing so, this paper contributes to the broader understanding of the political consequences of structural changes and makes the case for why we should highlight more the positive compared to negative developments in recent years.","Keywords: transformation, inequality, survey experiment","Eda Keremoglu","Eda Keremoglu","University of Konstanz","Hans Lueders","Stanford University","Ludwig Schulze","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","Stanford University","European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the profound cultural and socioeconomic differences between North America and Latin America, comparing their political systems has been challenging for academics. However, Brazil and the US currently offer a unique opportunity to carry out such comparative analysis. On the one hand they are both prominent federalist democracies that recently experienced democratic undermining under populist leaders, and on the other hand they faced such challenges with distinct institutional frameworks.

By establishing the causal relationship between electoral governance models and democratic resilience, this work will advance the following hypothesis: Brazil demonstrated an easier realignment to its established political norms and practices (resilience), at least partly attributed to specific mechanisms designed to prevent partisan intervention. In contrast, the US exhibited a more prolonged disruption from its institutional equilibrium, which was explained by the misalignment of a politized system that was resistant to change.","Keywords: populism, democracy, institutions, elections, US, Latin America,","Cristina Ramirez","Cristina Ramirez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Kings College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over the past two decades, the Mexican government has expanded the military’s role to include distributing social welfare, safeguarding elections, and patrolling streets. We argue that increased exposure to the military normalizes its presence and boosts support for its involvement in civilian domains. Using a survey experiment embedded in a nationally representative sample of Mexicans, we measure how exposure to images of military personnel in civilian roles shapes public attitudes. Our findings reveal that priming respondents with pictures of the military safeguarding ballot transportation, patrolling streets, and providing social welfare significantly increases support for their presence inside and outside polling stations during elections and increases respondents’ overall trust in the military. Viewing multiple images of these activities, compared to a single image, further amplifies support for military oversight of elections. Finally, exposure to the military providing social welfare raises approval for their involvement in other traditionally civilian domains, such as public works, operating ports, and education. These findings highlight an overlooked mechanism in the militarization of public life: habituation through normalized exposure, underscoring the potential risks of expanding military roles in civilian governance.","Keywords: Militarization, Mexican Politics, Political Behavior","Tesalia Rizzo Reyes","Tesalia Rizzo Reyes","University of California, Merced","Rodrigo Castro Cornejo","University of Massachusetts-Lowell","Abby Córdova","University of Notre Dame","Víctor Hernández-Huerta","Wake Forest University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Merced","University of Massachusetts-Lowell","Wake Forest University","University of Notre Dame",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0713_1043_0417.html","Grievances and Conflict: The Predictive Power of Subjective Grievance Measures","Early studies of the grievance-conflict nexus suggested that economic grievances make civil conflict more likely. Follow-up empirical studies that employed objective measures of grievance at the national level often failed to find a relationship between grievances and conflict, while more recent studies that disaggregate these measures to the subnational level often find support for a grievance-conflict relationship. In this paper, we argue that regardless of the level of analysis of previous work, nearly all suffer from the limitation that they employ objective indicators as measures of grievance, while the theoretical arguments for a grievance-conflict relationship require that economic hardship be subjectively perceived by actors on the ground. Bringing together subnationally aggregated public opinion data from cross-national surveys with a variety of demographic and other population-level information, we use advances in multilevel regression with poststratification to construct aggregate measures of subjective grievances among the populations of subnational units. Employing these measures, we show that subjective measures of grievance predict conflict in the way suggested by previous subnational researchers, largely washing away the effects of objective measures when both are considered simultaneously. This research provides a starting point and an exemplary framework for the study of factors related to conflict that are rooted in actors’ subjective perceptions of the political, economic, and social context.","Keywords: grievance, conflict, public opinion","David Hendry","David Hendry","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"," Sunhee Park","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It argues that traditional metrics, such as income and unemployment, may be insufficient to fully capture the impact of economic conditions on voting behavior. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of disposable income, which accounts for both earnings and expenditures. The paper proposes that this concept is particularly useful for understanding how economic shocks, such as increases in mortgage rates and rental prices, differentially affect various socioeconomic groups and shape their voting behavior. The study suggests that homeowners with mortgages and renters are more likely to punish the incumbent government (e.g., the Conservative Party in the UK) compared to debt-free homeowners when confronted with economic shocks (e.g., increases in mortgage rates), ceteris paribus income. Moreover, mortgage holders residing in more expensive areas tend to penalize the incumbent government more after economic shocks compared to those with mortgages in less affluent areas, ceteris paribus income. Finally, the paper highlights that income disparity may also play an important role in shaping voting behavior within housing classes, although the evidence is mixed. Thus, this paper calls for a more nuanced understanding of economic voting that incorporates wealth and cost-related economic shocks to better analyze voting behavior.","Keywords: economic voting, mortgage, renters, cost-driven","Deniz Tufur","Deniz Tufur",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Researcher",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0715_0642_0250.html","The Political Conflict Potential of Digitalization (TECHPER panel)","The digital revolution has triggered profound societal and economic transformations through advancements in information technologies, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Despite its far-reaching implications, digitalization has thus far played a limited role in shaping political conflict. This study examines the extent to which digitalization-induced structural change creates fertile ground for emerging political conflict over digitalization. Drawing on cleavage theory, we investigate two key prerequisites for cleavage formation. First, we assess whether objective winners and losers of digitalization develop a shared social identity within their respective groups (identity divide). Second, we explore whether winners and losers hold distinct views on digitalization policies (political divide). To evaluate the political conflict potential of digitalization, we employ carefully designed focus groups and a large-scale survey in Switzerland. Our findings reveal a nascent but discernible identity structuration and political divide around digitalization, with winners and losers expressing divergent perspectives on digitalization. While these patterns suggest fertile ground for cleavage formation, we also shed light on why broader conflict over digitalization has yet to materialize. First, winners prioritize digitalization as a political issue, whereas some losers view it as inevitable, fostering technological determinism and hindering policy demands. Second, the third cleavage component—mobilization and politicization by political actors—remains underdeveloped.

"abstract_0716_0717_1483.html","Sister, where is your sickle? Social class in the political behavior of LGBTQ+ individuals","Literature on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer (LGBTQ+) political behavior has scarcely engaged the relevance of social class. Accordingly, LGBTQ+ subjects are generally presented to act as a monolithic group regardless of objective or subjective class measurements. Not only this, but it assumes that class explanatory power is equal across LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ voters. Overall, the contemporary consensus embraces LGBTQ+ subjects as intrinsically liberal, middle class and cosmopolitan at face value, thus neglecting how class immanence affects the constitution of sexual and gender identities as the symbolic and engenders differential material interests within the community. In other words, the prevalent literature construes LGBTIQ+ as a political monolith prey to electoral capture by liberal elites. This paper introduces a new way to understand LGBTQ+ political behavior in majority systems, combining the supply and the demand side. On the one hand, we propose that working class LGBTQ+ subjects will be more likely than working class non-LGBTQ+ subjects to support social-democratic and liberal parties and engage in political participation due to linked fate. On the other hand, working class LGBTQ+ subjects will be more likely than affluent LGBTQ+ subjects to support more radical options on the left, materially and symbolically. We empirically assess these relations using existing datasets in the United States and Canada in conjunction with a novel LGBTQ+ dataset from the United Kingdom.","Keywords: LGBTQ; Social class; Political Behavior.","Joel Canto Roche","Joel Canto Roche",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Toronto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0717_0590_0450.html","Increasing the Supply of Women Candidates in Local Elections: A Field Experiment of Training and Networking Approaches in Zambia","How do we get more women on the ballot in new democracies? We introduce and test a new approach: Working with international and local NGOs in the forthcoming local elections in Zambia, we combine classic candidate training, which specifically targets the women, with a networking intervention aimed at the broader electoral context. The networking intervention provides women with points of contact to influential local leaders, trains local leaders to support women in politics, and engages local leaders with potential women candidates. The aim is to encourage women to run for political office by positioning them in local power networks and potentially improving a sometimes-hostile electoral environment. We test the effect of engaging women in political networks in combination with classic candidate training in a field experiment covering 12 randomly selected Zambian districts, encompassing 179 wards, and use informants to identify potential women candidates. The candidates are randomly selected (on the ward level) to receive either no interventions, classic candidate training, or candidate training and networking. We assess the effects as well as the channels of causation through a three-round survey as well as outcome data on eventual party-membership, primary election participation, and candidacy in the 2026 elections among the potential women candidates.","Keywords: Women in politics, elections, local politics, Africa","Merete Bech Seeberg","George Ofosu","London School of Economics","Merete Bech Seeberg","Aarhus University","Michael Wahman","Michigan State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","London School of Economics","Michigan State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing studies of regime transitions typically focus on aggregate outcomes, which may reflect changes in elite composition rather than individual behavior. Yet some elites survive even after a major transition, though whether they adapt their behavior in response to new incentives is unclear. In this paper we study patterns of bill (co)sponsorship in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies between 1982 and 2012, exploiting the fact that while most formal institutions remained the same, elections became increasingly competitive.Looking at within-individual variation, we find that legislators belonging to the ruling pri who served both before and after the 1997 electoral reform submitted many more bills in their second term than in the first. In contrast, opposition legislators and priístas elected twice before 1997 or twice afterwards did not change their behavior as much. We further exploit the fact that Mexico’s democratization proceeded at different paces in different states, finding that alternation at the subnational level had a more modest effect on legislative behavior.","Keywords: Mexico, transitions, PRI, bill drafting, democratization","Juan Pablo Micozzi, Adrian Lucardi","Juan Pablo Micozzi","ITAM"," Adrian Lucardi","ITAM"," Jeffrey Weldon","ITAM","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ITAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In that context, the paper studies Polish political actors’ strategies towards the Constitutional Tribunal (CT). While there is an abundant literature studying courts’ curbing strategies by autocratizing actors, we hardly know anything about the other side of the coin. Against that background, this paper examines the reestablishment of the RoL in the context of the Polish CT by posing the following research questions: which strategies have been employed by political actors seeking to facilitate the restoration of the RoL and actors inhibiting the process? Which factors explain domestic actors’ strategies towards the CT?The empirical analysis of this article draws on content and discourse analysis of national parliamentary debates devoted to the legislative project reforming the CT in Poland: one resolution (Druk nr. 226) and two legislative projects (Druk nr. 253 as well as Druk 254). Results indicate that autocratizing parties are likely to change their strategies towards courts depending on their position in the government. Preliminary result therefore suggest that in case of autocratizing parties their strategy towards courts seems to be mostly driven by partisan interests rather than deep ideology.","Keywords: Rule of Law, Constitutional Tribunal, courts’ (un)curbing, parliamentary parties","Aleksandra Maatsch","Aleksandra Maatsch",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Wroclaw",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0720_0352_0576.html","Elevating Positive Narratives: WhatsApp Campaign Effects on Migrant-Host Relations in Colombia","Colombia hosts nearly three million Venezuelan migrants, yet discrimination and distrust remain significant barriers to integration. Given the widespread use of WhatsApp, this intervention explores the platform's potential to improve migrant-host relations. In collaboration with Innovations for Poverty Action Colombia and El Barómetro, this study examines a WhatsApp video campaign – developed in an academic-NGO partnership and featuring positive economic, cultural, and social interactions between Venezuelans and Colombians – to enhance intergroup attitudes and socio-psychological integration. The randomized evaluation included 1,561 participants from 13 cities, randomly assigned to three groups: individuals receiving videos via WhatsApp, participants in WhatsApp co-viewing groups, or a comparison group viewing neutral, non-migration-related videos. The campaign led to positive changes in prejudice reduction and policy-relevant attitudes among Colombians, though the effects on Venezuelans’ attitudes were more limited. While participants expressed more positive norms about migrant-host relationships, they showed reluctance to share this content. To complement survey data and WhatsApp co-viewing group transcripts, we conducted one-on-one interviews with 20 participants to provide insights into their experiences and the potential mechanisms behind the observed effects. We also demonstrate the importance of measuring actual treatment uptake in video-based interventions. To this end, we tracked the time participants spent watching the videos and analyzed their engagement, including sharing behaviors. This study highlights the potential and limitations of digital campaigns and group-based messaging to foster social cohesion in migration contexts.","Keywords: migration; WhatsApp; polarization; integration","Nejla Asimovic","Nejla Asimovic","McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University","Mateo Vasquez-Cortes","School of Global Policy and Strategy, University of California San Diego","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University","School of Global Policy and Strategy, University of California San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0721_1064_0634.html","Strategic representation of women in far-right parties: a puzzling phenomenon","The proposed research paper aims to examine the increasing representation and leadership of women within far-right parties, that are predominantly led, represented, and supported by men. Drawing on Weeks' (2023) argument regarding strategic descriptive representation, the central hypothesis asserts that far-right populist parties strategically endorse female candidates to attract new female voters, while avoiding programmatic changes that might threaten their existing electoral base. My research examines whether such strategic endorsements are more common among far-right parties than among other political families. Existing literature on women's representation suggests that both numeric (descriptive) and policy (substantive) representation has historically been more aligned with left-leaning parties, underscoring the predictive influence of party ideology. In this context, the success of female leaders within far-right parties is a puzzling phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, I have compiled a comprehensive dataset on female candidate and MPs in Italian regional counculs from 2013 to 2024, along with data on gender differences in voter support across the country’s 20 regions. This period coincides with the significant rise of two far-right parties, Lega Nord (LN) and Fratelli d’Italia (FdI)- which is both led and funded by a woman. By comparing these parties with other political families, I aim to assess their strategic approaches to female representation and evaluate their electoral success. Preliminary results suggest that the hypothesis holds true for LN but not for FdI. This contrast highlights differences in their strategic support for female candidates and suggests opportunities for further research to explore these dynamics in greater depth.","Keywords: descriptive representation of women; radical right; candidate selection; subnational politics; Italian politics.","Rossella Merullo","Rossella Merullo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Hamburg (UHH)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Party Competition and Dynamic Group Identities","This paper examines how political parties in European democracies leverage group identities to increase their electoral support. We propose a novel framework of dynamic identity appeals in which parties try to make salient different identities that are associated with stronger party support. Building upon recent contributions, we argue that voters have a ""mental map"" that links various societal groups with a higher affinity for specific parties. We propose that when political actors make one of these group identities salient, this map activates, leading voters to feel a stronger connection to both the group and the associated party. This, in turn, increases their likelihood of voting for that party. We argue that this identity-based linkage between voters and parties operates independently of policy preferences. We provide evidence for this theory based on an original survey experiment conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduce and empirically test a novel theory of party competition in European multiparty systems, and second, we theorize the existence of party-voter linkages that extend beyond programmatic and clientelistic frameworks","Keywords: Political parties, identities","Tarik Abou-Chadi","Tarik Abou-Chadi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of OxfordHumboldt University BerlinUniversity of Oxford, Humboldt University Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0723_0818_0719.html","Appeals to Conservative Values and Support for Climate Action among Rightist Voters","Extant work documents pronounced ideological disagreement over climate action, with rightist voters becoming increasingly skeptical of climate protection measures. This divide poses a major challenge to effective climate governance. However, little is known about why rightist voters reject climate action and how political parties could sway these voters’ preferences in support of more ambitious climate action. Based on a pre-registered factorial survey experiment among a conservative-leaning sample of 5500 voters in Germany, this paper provides a detailed assessment of conservative voters’ climate attitudes and tests the effects of a conservative pro-climate narrative. Leveraging insights from political psychology, the paper argues that presenting climate action in connection to conservative core values like tradition, obedience, and social order should increase support for climate action among rightist voters. The results demonstrate that although conservative voters are concerned about the green transition of the economy, they primarily worry about its economic aspects rather than its environmental necessity. The findings also demonstrate that presenting climate action in connection to conservative values can be a viable political strategy – especially, for centre-right parties. This highlights the potential of a conservative pro-climate narrative in building the broad societal consensus needed for the green transition of the economy.","Keywords: Climate Change, Conservatism, Persuasion, Survey Experiment, Framing","Markus Kollberg","Markus Kollberg",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, little is known about how mainstream adapt to populist success. We examine how mainstream adjust their rhetoric, in both topics selection and ton. Using a unique corpus of over 300,000 speeches from the European Parliament, we confirm that populist rhetoric is significantly more emotional than that of mainstream politicians. Topic selection explains only a quarter of this emotional gap, leaving an extra-emotional component unique to populists. Then, leveraging variations in populist exposure across member states, we show that populist emotional rhetoric is contagious, shaping both the tone and topics of mainstream politicians. This shift is largely driven by a substitution effect, where less emotional mainstream politicians are replaced by those adopting a more emotional style.","Keywords: Political rhetoric, Emotions, Legislative behavior, European Parliament, text-as-data.","Hugo Subtil","Hugo Subtil","University of Zurich","Vincent Verger","CREST, Ecole Polytechnique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zurich","CREST, Ecole Polytechnique",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This work finds that “group-based appeals” are a central feature of contemporary party competition. Yet scholars disagree on a key conceptual question: what ‘counts’ as a group for the purposes of a group-based appeal? While all agree that appeals to consolidated socio-demographic categories – such as “women”, “the working class”, and “Catholics” – should be included, there is disagreement over whether to consider other kinds of group categories, for example, “feminists”, “hard-working families”, and “the German people.” We wade into this morass in two ways. First, we introduce a typology of group-based appeals, distinguishing between statements based on the kind of attributes they use to invoke group boundaries, whether sociodemographic, moral/cultural, political/ideological, or national. Second, we apply this typology to a corpus of British and German election manifestos, quantifying parties’ use of appeal types across categories. Empirical sections of the paper test the overall performance of a ‘broad’ versus ‘narrow’ conceptualization of group-based appeals, and also explore whether the use of appeal types varies systematically with particular party characteristics, especially age, governing experience, and left-right ideology. We test the effect on these different types of group appeals on voters' on party preferences with a survey experiment.","Keywords: Group appeals, Representation, Party strategies","Ronja Sczepanski","Ronja Sczepanski","Sciences Po Paris","Alex Mierke-Zatwarnicki","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po Paris","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0726_1789_0962.html","Uncertain performance: How to quantify uncertainty and draw test sets when evaluating classifiers","Supervised machine learning has become increasingly popular in social science research, often employing classifiers to measure political constructs of interest. While evaluating classifiers on a test set is critical for establishing measurement validity, guidance on how to conduct such evaluation is limited. In particular, researchers have paid insufficient attention to the variance of performance metrics estimated on test sets. This paper demonstrates that typically-sized test sets yield highly noisy and often uninformative estimates of classifier performance, particularly for imbalanced tasks —common in social science applications like identifying hateful tweets or political speeches containing emotional language— where one outcome class is rare. To address this issue, the paper introduces simple methods to quantify uncertainty in performance estimates, based on their sampling distribution and validated with simulations. It also introduces a design-based approach in political science to enhance statistical precision in evaluation tasks through efficient stratified sampling based on the outcome's predicted probability. Simulations show that this strategy meaningfully improves the precision of performance estimates, especially in imbalanced tasks, while ensuring they remain unbiased. Finally, the paper illustrates how to calculate the test set size required to achieve a desired level of statistical precision. Accompanying statistical software enables researchers to easily implement these methods, estimate uncertainty around performance metrics, implement optimal stratified sampling, and conduct power calculations for test set design.","Keywords: machine learning, validation, evaluation, sampling","Francisco Tomás-Valiente","Francisco Tomás-Valiente",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research on rape perceptions indicates that victims have a hard time detecting the violence they experience, especially under particular conditions like who the aggressor is or the use of force. We expand the knowledge in the field in two ways: one, we examine victims’ capacity to detect sexual violence generally, and not just rape, but we also distinguish between several forms of rape that have not been explored by previous literature. Second, we provide a novel argument and empirical data to show there is an important yet overlooked variable: partisanship. We argue that feeling closer to political parties that deny the existence of gender-based violence hinders the identification that this is the case. Our findings show that this is the case: partisanship has the largest effect over identifying oneself as a victim, reducing this probability by 25%. Sexual violence type, the aggressor and frequency also play an important role too. Overall, our findings have important implications to the study of sexual violence, victim identification and speak to the recent debates over feminist awakening and gender backlash.","Keywords: gender-based violence; sexual violence; surveys; ideology; partisanship; violence identification","Leire Rincón","Leire Rincón","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Alberto Ortega","VU Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","VU Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The central argument is that the structure of family networks shapes performance incentives: even in highly nepotistic environments, decentralised family networks can promote accountability and performance as family-employed members are closely monitored by their relatives. I empirically test this hypothesis using an original dataset of the Mexican judiciary that includes measures of family network centrality and density at the judicial circuit and court levels. The analysis reveals that horizontal family network structures—characterised by low degree of centrality and density—positively influence judicial performance.

"abstract_0729_0558_1165.html","Newsworthy Attacks: How U.S. Drone Strikes Are Shaped by Media Coverage and Public Opinion","We investigate how media coverage influences the timing and public perception of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. Specifically, we ask: How does news congestion in the U.S. and Pakistan affect the likelihood of a drone strike, and how is this coverage shaped to serve political interests? Using American drone warfare as a focal case, we analyze how drone strikes are not only timed but also reported in both countries, examining the strategic role of the media in shaping public opinion. Our analysis uses an instrumental variable approach to explore whether media pressure correlates with changes in the probability of drone strikes. We find that major news events in the U.S. decrease the likelihood of a strike, while similar events in Pakistan increase it by 6.5% the following day. Our findings suggest two possible mechanisms: U.S. leaders may seek positive media attention by publicizing successful strikes, or they may strategically time strikes to coincide with major events in Pakistan to avoid backlash. To further investigate these mechanisms, we analyze how media in both the U.S. and Pakistan cover these attacks and incorporate public opinion data to assess Americans’ views on terrorism and the perceived success of the U.S. government's fight against it. The Bush and Obama administration’s use of drones exemplifies how media manipulation serves both domestic political gain and international strategic goals. These insights are supported by robustness and mechanism tests, providing a comprehensive look at the intersection of media, military intervention, and political accountability.","Keywords: Drone strikes, media, public opinion, US, Pakistan.","Kirill Chmel, Abhyudaya Tyagi","Kirill Chmel","Columbia University"," Abhyudaya Tyagi","Columbia University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, whether this potential means that politicians use moral appeals strategically has so far not been investigated. If this were the case, we should see moral appeals ebb and flow with the election cycle, such that moralization intensifies as an election is nearing. To test politicians’ strategic use of moral appeals, we use fine-grained social media data from six countries over an eight-year period to document dynamic changes in moralization including whether such changes can be predicted by distance to an election. We also examine the relative use of positive moral appeals emphasizing virtues and negative moral appeals emphasizing vices as a function of the election cycle. Finally, to validate the mobilizing potential of moral appeals, we examine patterns of likes and retweets, including whether moral appeals are more effective in generating social media engagement during election campaign periods.

"abstract_0731_0579_1244.html","The Secret Ballot, Landholding Inequality, and Popular Support for Suffrage Extension: Evidence from Four Swiss Direct-Democratic Votes","Secret ballot systems aim to ensure voter anonymity and thereby thwart attempts at voter intimidation or vote buying. The secret ballot is thus a key institutional innovation in the process of democratization. Surprisingly, little empirical evidence exists on its effectiveness. In this paper, we take advantage of four direct-democratic votes between 1866 and 1877 in Switzerland, all concerning franchise extension to the same previously excluded groups. In each case, a majority of the voters rejected franchise extension. In line with the existing literature on concentrated resource endowments and democratization, we show that landholding inequality decreases support for suffrage extension. We argue that this negative relationship between landholding inequality and local support for suffrage extension reflects pre-industrial forms of social power and control, which undermine democratization preferences of the local population. The introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 allows us to examine whether anonymity enables voters to escape these processes of social control and express their political preferences more freely. We show that the introduction of the secret ballot significantly reduces the negative impact of landholding inequality on support for suffrage extension. Moreover, factors influencing the ability of local landlords to exercise social control – population density and distance to the political capital – moderate the relationship between the secret ballot, landholding inequality, and support for suffrage extension. Together, this evidence suggests that the secret ballot was effective in curtailing local elites’ ability to manipulate political processes.","Keywords: secret ballot, democratization, social control, landholding inequality, suffrage extension","Andreina Thoma","Patrick Emmenegger","University of St. Gallen"," Andreina Thoma","University of St. Gallen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of St. Gallen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines how narrowly won elections by far-right candidates in the United States and France influence attitudinal and behavioral hostility toward minorities, measured through hate crimes and prejudicial attitudes. Using regression discontinuity designs, we plan to show that far-right success amplifies exclusionary rhetoric, legitimizes hostility, and fosters an environment where discrimination becomes more socially acceptable.

While many studies demonstrate that investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare yield positive electoral returns for incumbents, others find zero or even negative effects. We identify four key mechanisms that help explain when and why public goods investments may fail to translate into electoral gains: (1) interest group opposition, where reforms alienate influential stakeholders; (2) unmet expectations, where public goods fall short of voter expectations; (3) reduced clientelism, where services diminish reliance on patronage networks; and (4) mismatched priorities, where investments do not align with voter preferences. Our findings contribute to theories of electoral accountability, highlighting both the potential and the limits of public service provision as a strategy for securing voter support.

On the one hand, repression might stifle the movement’s mobilization efforts; on the other hand, repression might have a contrary effect by strengthening the coherence of the repressed. We study this question in the context of the socialist movement in late 19th and early 20th century Germany. In the first part of the paper, we use an original geo-coded dataset of more than 2,000 bans of socialist associations and publications based on the Socialist Laws (1878-1890) to analyze if the suppression of German Socialists triggered a regionally differentiated mobilization of the Social Democratic Party. Studying electoral outcomes at the electoral district level, we explore how the intensity of oppression is linked to the strength of the Social Democratic Party in the German Empire. We find that Social Democratic vote shares increased disproportionally in those districts where oppression was most intense. In a second step, we extend this analysis to the Weimar Republic to explore to what extent these differences persisted. Here, our results suggest a continued strengthening of the left, particularly of the more moderate left in regions that saw more intense oppression. On the other hand, repression is not correlated with stronger results for the Communist party, which could be expected if the repression had caused radicalization among the repressed.","Keywords: socialism, state repression, social democratic parties, democracy","Dominik Flügel","Dominik Flügel","Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Geneva","Lukas Haffert","Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Geneva","Anton Könneke","Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Geneva","Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Elites are harder to access than citizens, and the behavioralist paradigm has prioritized public opinion research. Yet, understanding why some politicians undermine democratic institutions while others in similar circumstances do not is a vital question in the study of democratic erosion.We explore this question by examining how committed political elites are to democracy and why. Our study focuses on India, a country that has seen significant democratic backsliding in the past decade. Using a survey of 300 politicians—both winning and losing MPs and MLAs—across four Indian states, we investigate their commitment to three dimensions of democracy: electoral, liberal, and egalitarian. Additionally, we examine how their social backgrounds, networks, political pathways, and criminal records shape their adherence to democratic norms.A key hypothesis is that while elites may endorse democracy in principle, they often fail to uphold its values in practice. To capture this gap, our survey includes questions on abstract democratic principles (e.g., protecting freedom of expression during crises) and their concrete applications in India (e.g., raiding a news agency’s office). By studying the origins and dimensions of elites' democratic commitments, our research sheds light on the mechanisms of democratic erosion and the role elites play in either safeguarding or undermining democratic institutions.","Keywords: democratic backsliding, elites, democratic norms, India","Ursula Daxecker","Kris Ruijgrok","University of Amsterdam; KITLV, Leiden","Ursula Daxecker","University of Amsterdam","Ward Berenschot","University of Amsterdam; KITLV, Leiden","Imke Harbers","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","KITLV, Leiden",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, limited empirical research has explored their potential institutional complementarity. We argue that combining both approaches increases state's capacity to provide universal goods and services. Using data from Brazilian municipalities, we examine how the effects of participatory budgeting (PB) are conditional on anti-corruption audits through a difference-in-differences with heterogeneous effects design. The results suggest that PB increases healthcare spending, especially in municipalities with strong state bureaucratic capacity, where spending shifts toward universal rather than targeted goods.

This paper investigates the transnational dimensions of anti-government extremism (AGE) through the lens of conspiracy narratives, focusing particularly on the QAnon movement's role as a radicalising and unifying force across polities, social media platforms and extremist milieus. Empirically, the paper explores the relationship between the storming of the Reichstag (Berlin, 2020), the Capitol (Washington, 2021), and Congress (Brasília, 2022) by conducting comparative network analyses of QAnon-related Telegram channels in the run up of the events. By then examining their qualitative linguistic usage patterns of hate speech and calls for violence, this paper also considers narrative similarities that foster anti-democratic attitudes and anti-government violence. The paper builds on the hypothesis that meta-conspiracy theories with anti-elitist epistemologies like QAnon operate as powerful bridging narratives, connecting diverse actors and movements across regional and political contexts.","Keywords: Anti-Government Extremism, Conspiracy Theories, Network Analysis, Political Violence, Social Media","Leoni Heyn","Leoni Heyn",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Institute for Social Sciences, Department for Political ScienceInstitute for Security Policy Kiel, Department for Research on Terrorism and Radicalisation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0738_1465_0418.html","The Strategic Behavior of Rebel Leaders: How Rebel Leaders Shape Splits in their Organizations","How do rebel leaders manage splits in their organizations? The leaders of state governments strategically distribute goods to maintain a stable base of power and prevent widespread defections. Do rebel leaders engage in similar behavior? Existing theories of splintering largely overlook the role of rebel group leaders. This paper challenges this existing work and contributes a new theory of splintering in which rebel leaders play a central role in the splintering process. I argue that rebel leaders can leverage their control over group structures, decision-making, and resources to actively manage internal conflicts and stop subordinates from breaking away. However, periods of leadership transition disrupt these tools and provide new motivation and opportunity for splintering. Consequently, organizational splits are most likely when groups transition between leaders. I assess this theory with original quantitative and qualitative evidence from Myanmar. Drawing on field interviews with rebel leaders, I find that leaders employ several tools to manage splintering pressures during Myanmar's controversial peace process. Using original historical data, I show that groups were more likely to split during years of leader transition. Overall, I find evidence that rebel leaders act strategically to shape splintering in their organizations.","Keywords: rebel groups, civil war, peace agreement, Myanmar, fieldwork","Kaitlyn Robinson","Kaitlyn Robinson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Rice University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper investigates how these twin trends have affected other-regarding preferences for the welfare state by carrying out an online survey experiment with a sample of 4,000 respondents from the United States. We find that people are less inclined to provide welfare state support to the university educated. So, not only do university-educated workers think they are less in need of welfare state insurance, other people also think that they are. We also find evidence that this dynamic has been exacerbated by (skill-biased) technological change that has (further) improved the position of university-educated workers. Overall, our results hold important insights for the future of the welfare state in contemporary knowledge economies.","Keywords: technological change, education, welfare state preferences, survey experiment","David Hope","David Hope","King's College London","Sebastian Diessner","Leiden University","Niccolo Durazzi","University of Modena & Reggio Emilia","Federico Filetti","London School of Economics","Hanna Kleider","King's College London","Julian Limberg","King's College London","Simone Tonelli","University of Edinburgh","","","","","","","King's College London","Leiden University","University of Edinburgh","London School of Economics","University of Modena & Reggio Emilia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0740_1143_1484.html","Normative Breaches and Women’s Mobilization: The Enduring Legacy of Executions in Catalonia","This paper investigates the enduring impact of wartime violence on social capital and political mobilization. Specifically, we examine how exposure to extreme forms of publicly displayed violence, such as executions, during periods of war and authoritarian rule influences participation in civic associations during peacetime. Drawing on insights from two distinct bodies of literature - political violence and social norms - we argue that certain acts of violence are perceived as normative breaches even in the midst of conflict. We contend that executions of women exemplify such breaches for two key reasons: their rarity and their public visibility, which brings the suffering and sacrifice of women to the forefront of local communities’ awareness. This, in turn, can trigger enduring narratives within affected communities, shaping women’s social capital and political mobilization over the long term. To empirically test our hypothesis, we focus on Catalonia, utilizing data on state violence during the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist regime. Our analysis relies on extensive datasets capturing the universe of associations post-1975 as the primary outcome measure. Our findings reveal a positive association between the execution of women and women’s social capital, solely within associations related to women’s rights. Notably, this effect is exclusive to executions and not observed with other forms of oppression. This suggests that the mechanism activating enduring local dynamics, even decades after periods of authoritarian rule, is exposure to selective killings of female individuals.","Keywords: gender norms; political violence; political behaviour; civil war; political legacy","Magalí Serra Duran","Magalí Serra Duran","European University Institute"," Karmen Misiou","European University Institute","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0741_2320_0452.html","Evaluating the Effect of Inclusive Historical Narratives on Support for Undemocratic Measures","Concerns about the state of democracy have surged in several countries amid new evidence that many citizens do not value democratic principles or accept election results. We theorize that support for measures restricting the political rights of the opposition will be higher among individuals who subscribe to ethno-cultural conceptions of national identity and associate the opposition with ethnic minority groups. Building on this argument, we hypothesize that interventions fostering perceptions that minority groups are central to national identity can strengthen democratic commitment. To test this theory, we examine whether inclusive historical narratives embedded in history textbooks affect perceptions of minorities’ place in the nation, as well as individuals’ willingness to place restrictions on the democratic rights of the opposition. We conduct incentivized online experiments across the world’s two largest democracies—India (N=2,049) and the United States (N=1,998)—randomly assigning participants to (1) inclusive educational content sourced from real history textbooks and (2) information about the political opposition’s ethnic composition. Using innovative revealed preference measures, we evaluate how our treatments affect democratic commitment. Our results show that while inclusive historical narratives tend to strengthen democratic commitment, they can also provoke backlash under certain conditions. Our findings highlight the important role of national identities in shaping support for democratic principles and indicate that battles over history education may carry consequences for democratic resilience.","Keywords: Democratic commitment, historical narratives, ethnicity, experimental research","Emmy Lindstam","Emmy Lindstam","IE University","Nicholas Haas","University of Aarhus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IE University","University of Aarhus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0742_0920_0518.html","Your Democracy, Not Mine! The Rhetoric of Democracy in Parliamentary Interpellations During Taiwan’s Authoritarian Era","Recent studies of authoritarianism have paid attention not only to the existence of nominally democratic institutions, but also to what political elites say within these institutions. Even the most notorious dictators speak democracy, and authoritarian elites tend to use democracy as an instrument to strengthen the legitimacy of the regime. The opposition, by contrast, might promote democracy in order to push forward regime changes. This research probes the concept of democracy in the interpellations made by the members of parliament from different groups during the authoritarian era (1970-1992). Specifically, I study four groups of the MPs, including those elected from the Mainland China, local Taiwanese elites leaning toward the government, the opposition soft-liners and the opposition hard-liners. I train a word embedding using a corpus where “democracy” appears for each group-year and examine what words are semantically close to democracy for each group-year. Additionally, I perform semantic network analyses to further investigate the connections of words to democracy across groups and time. For the Mainland-elected MPs, democracy might be more connected to Sun Yat-Sen’s philosophy and the antagonism toward the communists, while it might be more associated to Taiwan’s social and economic developments for the local Taiwanese elites. Meanwhile, democracy might be more associated with human rights, regime changes and Taiwan independence for the opposition. This research contributes to the literature on regime transition by empirically examining the rhetoric of democracy shown in a nominally-democratic parliament. The findings also address long-lasting controversies over what politicians mean by democracy.","Keywords: Nominally Democratic Institutions, Authoritarian Parliaments, Democratization, Text Analysis, Semantic Network Analysis","Isaac Shih-hao Huang","Isaac Shih-hao Huang",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0743_1834_0538.html","How Democratic Backsliding Influences Sentencing Behaviors: Evidence From Hong Kong","Democratic backsliding is often associated with the erosion of judicial independence. One mechanism is the rise of special jurisdictions, such as military or political courts, which are designed to enforce social order and challenge the authority of regular legal systems. This paper argues that authoritarian-leaning executives appoint ""law-and-order"" judges to these special jurisdictions and that the establishment of such courts can influence judicial behavior more broadly. This paper examines the hypotheses in the case of Hong Kong, a special administrative unit of China. In response to social movements, the central government imposed a national security law in 2020, creating a specialized judicial jurisdiction with a subgroup of judges designated to handle these cases. Using LLM-assisted text classification on 24,868 ordinary criminal cases decided between 2010 and 2024, this paper finds that executives selected judges who exhibited stricter stances on order and crime for national security cases. However, differences in sentencing behavior between national security and ordinary judges decreased after the establishment of the special jurisdiction, suggesting a spillover effect on the broader judiciary.","Keywords: Rule of law, judicial bias, political court, text classification","Siyun Jiang","Siyun Jiang",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"IE University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, studies have shown that poor people are more likely to be risk-averse, meaning the former two explanations would be mutually exclusive. I resolve this paradox by arguing that poverty distorts individuals' migration expectations, thus increasing their propensity to migrate even under risk aversion. To test this hypothesis, I apply panel data on more than 10,000 people living in The Gambia, one of the world's poorest countries, from which migrants depart on an often deadly journey across the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea. Respondents were interviewed in 2019 and re-contacted over the course of a year, allowing for measuring not only migration intentions but also migration behavior. The results show that both relative poverty and general risk tolerance predict migration. Poverty, however, is also associated with over-confidence about the journey. Put differently, hardship drives even risk-averse individuals into high-risk migration, casting doubt on the efficacy of many policies aimed at deterring flows.","Keywords: migration, risk preferences, poverty, panel data, migration policy","Daniel Auer","Daniel Auer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Collegio Carlo AlbertoUniversity of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0745_1169_0636.html","Breaking the Backlash: How Early Exposure to Female Authority Reduces Men’s Far-Right Support","While a substantial literature documents that men who feel threatened by social change, gender equality, and women's rising aspirations tend to support far-right parties, there is limited evidence on the role of early socialization in shaping such attitudes. Bridging theories of cultural backlash and the demand-side dynamics of far-right support with theories of political socialization, we argue that early exposure to a female authority figure—specifically, an older sister—durably impacts men’s outlook on traditional gender roles by confronting them with female agency and authority early in their lives. This experience should reduce their susceptibility to the culturally conservative ideologies advanced by far-right parties, which emphasize traditional gender hierarchies and the marginalization of women in power. To test this proposition, we draw on a unique survey dataset linked to Swedish registry data that connects respondents' party preferences with detailed information on their family background, allowing us to exploit the random assignment of growing up with an older sister. Our findings show that men exposed to a female authority figure in early life are significantly less likely to vote for the far right. This large effect remains robust after accounting for a range of confounding factors, including socio-economic status, parental education, and family structure. In drawing attention to the role of early childhood socialization in influencing voters' support for the far right, our study enhances our understanding not only of the micro-level foundations of far-right support, but also of the critical role of internalized social norms in shaping political behavior.","Keywords: radical right support, cultural backlash, natural experiment, political socialisation, social norms","Sirus Dehdari, Julia Schulte-Cloos","Sirus Dehdari","Stockholm University","Julia Schulte-Cloos","University of Marburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stockholm University","University of Marburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Insights from a Survey Experiment","Parties often target specific groups in their campaigns, but there is limited empirical evidence on whether this strategy effectively increases electoral support. We conducted a survey experiment in Germany (N=3,500) in 2024 using fictional campaign posters to examine how voters respond to promises targeting specific groups, such as parents, pensioners, or rural residents, compared to broad-based pledges benefiting everyone. We argue that targeting conveys information on linkages between parties and specific groups and increases the perceived stakes of the pledge and thereby its visibility among target voters. As a result, parties might anticipate increased electoral support from voters (1) identifying with the targeted group and/or (2) perceiving this group as deserving. However, we find no electoral benefits of targeted promises compared to broad-based ones. Instead, our results reveal a backlash effect among voters outside the group or those who do not view the group as deserving. These findings suggest that targeting might carry more electoral losses than returns.","Keywords: Electoral targeting, Electoral behaviour, Prospective, Survey experiment, Group politics","Isabelle Guinaudeau","Isabelle Guinaudeau","Centre Marc Bloch","Elisa Deiss-Helbig","University of Konstanz","Theres Matthieß","University of Göttingen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Centre Marc Bloch","University of Konstanz","University of Göttingen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While research consistently demonstrates that language use contains linguistic signatures indicative of personality traits, and voters in many countries--including the U.S.--prioritize certain traits in leaders, we show people are surprisingly poor at accurately interpreting personality traits from language alone. Specifically, using a range of methodologies and novel datasets, both experimental and observational, we show voters' perceptions of personality are often unreliable. These findings challenge assumptions about how personality plays into campaign communication and suggest that voters may be easily misled or unable to accurately judge leaders' personalities through speech or text.

We also study under what conditions MEPs talk about integrity themes, testing hypotheses on their party ideology and their populist versus mainstream condition.

"abstract_0749_2247_0821.html","Testing the effects of party-group linkage and identity strength on vote choice","Parties’ connections to social groups are critical to their electoral success, particularly in contexts of de- and realignment of voter loyalties. The literature emphasizes that demographic characteristics can become salient social identities, which parties can mobilize through direct group-based appeals to strengthen party-group linkages. However, existing research mostly infers group memberships from demographics, neglecting the importance of identification strength. We argue that party-group linkages positively influence vote choice only when voters strongly identify with the relevant social group. If a voter belongs to a group “on paper” but lacks a strong sense of belonging, a party’s representation of that group’s interests is unlikely to sway their vote. Our study examines how voters perceive party commitments to social groups and how these perceptions influence electoral behaviour. We hypothesize that voters are more likely to support a party if they believe it strongly represents the social groups they identify with. The stronger their identification with those groups, the stronger this effect is likely to be. We test this assumption using novel survey data from the German National Election Study (GLES Tracking). By highlighting the role of identity strength, this paper advances our understanding of a claim in social group appeals research, for which evidence is still rather scarce, namely that voters recognize and electorally reward parties' group images.","Keywords: social identities, survey data, identity strength, party-group linkages","Felicia Riethmüller","Felicia Riethmüller","University of Göttingen","Denise Al-Gaddooa","University of Göttingen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Göttingen","University of Göttingen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This question has become increasingly important in the face of ongoing autocratization and the growing political weight of autocratic powers, yet it has not been investigated systematically.We address this gap using an elite-level survey experiment involving 2000 high-level bureaucrats, who are key actors in the design and implementation of international treaties and whose preferences greatly impact states’ implementation of international agreements. Our sample consists of bureaucrats from ministries and state agencies representing ten different policy areas, and includes ten countries, covering democracies and autocracies in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas.The conjoint experiment will expose respondents to different hypothetical treaties, varying in issue area, represented values, enforcement mechanisms, and the level of compliance from other democracies and autocracies, and measure how variation in these treatments affects their preferences for compliance with international agreements.We expect bureaucrats in democracies to be more likely to favor compliance than their autocratic counterparts, especially when agreements pertain to social and political reforms, and when they place weight on liberal values. Conversely, we expect the preferences of bureaucrats in autocracies and democracies to be more aligned when agreements primarily concern technocratic aspects of global governance, place weight on states’ autonomy, and are being complied with by most other autocracies.These findings carry important implications for the future of global governance, offering a nuanced understanding of how the increasing power of autocracies may shape different areas of international cooperation.","Keywords: Compliance, Cooperation, Regime Type, Experiment","Jonas Willibald Schmid","Jonas Tallberg","University of Stockholm"," Faradj Koliev","University of Stockholm"," Jonas Willibald Schmid","University of Stockholm","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Stockholm",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A comparative study on climate politics’ most popular instrument","Climate policy efforts struggle to keep pace in an era of accelerating climate change and growing economic and political inequalities. Existing research shows the climate mitigation success of countries that first introduce subsidies to promote the switch to renewables and sequence it with regulation and carbon taxes. Still, the general public overwhelmingly prefers to stick with subsidies.This raises the question of whether climate subsidies really promote not only the acceptance of ambitious climate politics but also the switch to the other, stricter climate protection instruments, namely taxes and regulations, which are necessary for the policy mix of a successful strategy. I argue that, from a comparative political economy perspective, consumer subsidies offer the necessary public exposure to direct demand for climate policies. But can policymakers leverage subsidies for measures like energetic modernization or electric vehicles to perpetuate national strategies and facilitate bans and rising fossil fuel prices?To answer this question, I use automated classification coding based on an established database of domestic climate policies (N=3000) and measures of carbon pricing schemes across developed democracies. This allows me to test the relationship between subsidy adoption and the prioritization of stricter climate measures in national policymaking by running regression analyses across 30 years in a large sample of high-income democracies. My results show that the adoption of climate subsidies, in fact, can serve as a blueprint for ambitious instruments. Still, domestic factors, such as the political landscape, structural demands, and diffusion through mutual dependencies, remain dominant in explaining climate policymaking.","Keywords: domestic climate subsidies, stricter climate instruments, comparative public policy, automated classification coding, longitudinal analysis","Simon Rittershaus","Simon Rittershaus",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0753_1014_1167.html","Online political expression under censorship: when backlash is short-lived","The implications of censorship are often boiled down to two overall mechanisms by scholars: either the regime succeeds in silencing dissent or will endure the cost of backfire in the form of circumvention or public backlash. Much existing scholarship debates the contextual characteristics and settings in which each mechanism prevails. This paper analyzes how overt and repressive censorship shapes online discourse in times of political unrest. Using Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and subsequent authoritarian consolidation as a case, this paper studies over 4,500,000 comments across different pro and anti-regime-leaning YouTube channels targeted toward Russian-speaking audiences. I use an embedding-based topic model to analyze the changes in online discourse in the days following the invasion as well as the introduction of Russia's censorship law in March 2022. The results suggest that discourse on collective action nearly doubled at the start of the invasion. However, both discourse on collective action and criticism of the war sharply dropped as the law was introduced. In sum, the findings indicate that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine initially triggered (online) backlash but that the regime swiftly curtailed the dissent through the implementation of overt and repressive censorship. This showcases how regimes can successfully balance sparks of unrest by doubling down on repression. In light of the findings, the paper contributes to the theoretical discussion on the complicated dynamics of backlash and deterrence. It demonstrates how the impermanent nature of backlash patterns can make the associated costs worthwhile for autocrats hoping to reduce long-term risks.","Keywords: political expression online, self-censorship, Russia, information control, NLP","Kristina Aleksandrovna Pedersen","Kristina Aleksandrovna Pedersen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Copenhagen Business SchoolUniversity of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0754_1723_1171.html","How does the communication strategy employed by political elites influence individuals’ evaluation of political elites?  ","In our fast-moving digital communication environment, where citizens regularly make their voices heard, political parties and candidates face an important dilemma: should they stick to their message or adapt it to keep up with the times at the risk of being perceived as “flip-flopping”?  Evidence suggests that elite repositioning on specific policy issues can influence voters. Recent research shows that when parties change their position on an issue, they adopt specific communication strategies in anticipation of potential electoral punishment – by framing their new position differently from the previous one. However, little is known about the extent to which such communication strategies affect voter perception. As an important contribution to the literature, in this paper we empirically test how political elites’ reframing of their message when changing position on an issue affects the public's credibility perception and voting intention. Using a cutting-edge experimental survey design, we present different vignettes of a fictitious (online) newspaper article to a representative sample of the Swiss population. The vignette exposes respondents to statements by a fictitious politician on an issue at two points in time, where the text varies in terms of whether the politician changes position or not, and whether the politician changes the frame or not. Our results indicate that voters are indeed more forgiving of political elites who shift their position along with their frame. Given the declining political trust in many advanced democracies, our findings highlight a crucial issue for the influence of elite communication on public perceptions.","Keywords: repositioning, political communication, political elites, political behavior","Anna-Lena Nadler","Anna-Lena Nadler","University of Fribourg"," Alexandra Feddersen","University of Fribourg"," Jonas Baur","University of Fribourg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Fribourg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Very little is known about the impact different characteristics of previous undemocratic regimes have on post-transitional democracies. If autocratic legacies have been extensively studied from an ideological standpoint (e.g. how ideology shapes attitudes towards policy and voting preferences), in this article, I provide an innovative political economy approach to legacies of autocratic regimes.Using archival evidence collected at the province-level for Franco’s dictatorship in Spain (1939-1975), I show that the “self-interested” relationship between the general population and autocratic incumbents, operating through a top-down logic of reception of material benefits provided by autocratic policies, is crucial in shaping post-transitional attitudes towards the regime, policies and voting preferences. This article empirically demonstrates that when an autocracy produces policy outputs resulting in welfare improvements that are large and widespread among the general population, after transitions to democracy — which constitutes a situation of high uncertainty —, rational voters are motivated to vote for parties that, by aligning themselves with the past regimes in order to exploit its competence, would offer to maintain the benefits delivered during the regime.The economic growth brought about by the modernization process that took place in Spain during the second-half of the regime (“Spanish Economic Miracle”), explains the post-transitional electoral success of right-wing parties associated with the past dictatorship. Areas with greater quality of life improvements, indicated by GDP per capita, showed higher voting rates for these parties.","Keywords: autocratic legacies, political economy, economic growth, democratic transitions, material benefits, post-transitional parties","Catarina Leão","Catarina Leão",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po, Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0756_2194_1385.html","Polarized effects of attacks against minorities","In recent years there has been a significant increase in violence against migrants and minorities in developed western democracies. How does this violence affect attitudes towards minority groups? Research to this point has generally focused on the effects of Islamist terror attacks, showing that these attacks have a negative effect on attitudes towards Muslims (and other minorities in some cases). However, data from the USA suggests there has been twice as many attacks by right-wing groups against minorities than Islamist attacks since 2008.  Utilizing unexpected event design, we present evidence from two distinct contexts which shows that attacks against minorities polarize attitudes towards the targeted group. Firstly, in Germany, we investigate the ramifications of the 2020 Hanau shootings, which targeted migrants and claimed nine lives. Secondly, in the US, we delve into the aftermath of two incidents: the 2019 El Paso shootings, targeting Latinx individuals and resulting in 23 fatalities, and the 2015 Chapel Hill shootings, which targeted Muslims and led to three deaths. Our analyses indicate that the effect of these attacks on attitudes vary across the population. Specifically, prejudice against victim groups increases among right-wing voters (in Germany) and Republicans (in the US), and it decreases among left-wing voters and Democrats. These effects typically subside within a week.

"abstract_0757_1900_1247.html","Local Elections and Central Government Grants","According to Cox & McCubbins (1986), parties reward their core constituency in an effort to maintain the coalition of voters and activists that brought them into office. There is also ample evidence that intergovernmental transfers in established democracies accrue disproportionally to politically aligned local constituencies (e.g., Scheiner 2005, Solé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro 2008, Tavits 2009, Fouirnaies and Mutlu-Eren 2015, Hessami 2017, Coman 2020). In this paper, we make two novel contributions to this literature. First, we develop a theoretical argument integrating both the strategic choice of national parties about whether to compete in local elections or not, and the resulting effects this choice has on intergovernmental transfers back to the local level. The literature on local party system nationalization (e.g., Kjaer and Elklit 2010; Ennser-Jedenastik and Hansen 2013; Dodeigne, Close and Teuber 2021) remains largely silent on this question. Second, we exploit a national transfer program to poorer municipalities introduced in Sweden in 1917 that included a discretionary component which allowed the national government to withhold or adjust what transfers were granted. In a two-period difference-in-difference model based on data from >1600 municipalities in 1937-1939, we find that the newly installed Social Democratic-Farmers Union coalition government disproportionally rewarded municipalities in which these two parties made significant gains in previous local elections. However, if broken down by party, the effect is minuscule for the Social Democrats but quite sizable for the Farmers. We discuss possible interpretations of this result.","Keywords: elections, party system, intergovernmental transfers, local government","Jan Teorell","Jan Teorell","Stockholm University"," Kåre Vernby","Stockholm University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stockholm University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0758_0196_1581.html","Rulers, Resistance, and Retreat: Flight as a Constraint on Predatory Rule","Predatory rulers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible from the population, but that does not mean they are unconstrained. Scholars have often focused on rebellions as such a constraint due to the costs they impose on rulers. However, rebellions also involve severe costs for participants, including risks of injury, punishment, or death. Given these costs, I argue that commoners frequently opted to resist predatory extraction by fleeing, especially during the pre-industrial era. To explore the implications of this contention, I model the dynamic between a revenue-maximizing ruler and a peasant, who chooses to comply, flee, or rebel. This model shows that when rebellion is relatively costly, flight, rather than rebellion, serves to constrain the ruler. I provide empirical evidence for this insight by drawing from the case of indigenous exploitation in colonial Peru. First, I demonstrate that the Spanish Crown set lower tax rates where indigenous peasants could more easily flee. Using a difference-in-differences design, I then show that when peasants were subjected to overextraction through forced labor in mines, they responded by fleeing rather than rebelling. These findings provide a new perspective on the dynamic between rulers and their subjects that can be applied to numerous phenomena and settings.","Keywords: Authoritarian rule, revenue extraction, flight, rebellion, historical political economy","Kimberly Renk","Kimberly Renk",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0759_2290_0149.html","Elite Support for Incumbent Takeover: Evidence from Turkey","Research on contemporary incumbent takeovers by elected leaders demonstrates that incumbents often centralize power with the backing of their regime coalition. While canonical theories of authoritarian power-sharing posit that elites should collectively resist moves, a puzzling number of takeovers gain traction with the support of key coalition members, seemingly against their own institutional interests. In this article, we offer a new theoretical account of this variation. We argue that whether regime elites align with or resist incumbent-led power consolidation hinges on their positions within the regime hierarchy. Elite rank influences their assessments of long-term costs and benefits, as well as their exposure to punishment risks and replaceability. To empirically test our claims, we develop a novel measure of elite loyalty and support for presidentialism based on large-scale, automated text analysis of parliamentary speeches by Turkish legislators during a period of political upheaval (2016–2018) coinciding with the rise of a personalist autocracy. Combining our measures of loyalty and support for presidentialism with detailed biographical data on legislators, we show that elites’ positions within the regime hierarchy critically shape their responses to incumbent-led centralization. Higher-ranked elites, with robust networks and resources that insulate them from immediate punishment or removal, and more to lose in terms of agenda-setting power, are less likely to endorse the takeover. In contrast, lower-ranked elites, facing greater vulnerability, are more inclined to support centralization to safeguard their survival and advance their careers within the evolving power-sharing framework. Our findings provide new insights into the micro-foundations of regime personalization.","Keywords: Incumbent Takeovers, Regime Personalization, Democratic Breakdown","Berker Kavasoglu","Berker Kavasoglu","Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Germany","Kevin Koehler","Institute of Law, Politics, and Development Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Germany","Institute of Law, Politics, and Development Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0760_2683_0208.html","How Militarizing Public Security Affects Local Collective Action Capacity","Countries across the globe increasingly militarize law enforcement in response to security threats. However, the extant scholarship suggests that militarizing law enforcement has negative domestic implications: more violence and abuse of human rights, and less taxation, public support for police reform, and trust in law enforcement. While research on state-society relations suggests that a strong civil society can help insulate communities from crime and organized violence, other studies argue that civil society is vulnerable to the negative, potentially violent effects of having high levels of social capital and capacity for collective action, such as turns to vigilantism. How does increased militarization affect the strength of civil society and its ability to protect citizens in times of threat? This paper examines how militarization affects civil society’s capacity to provide services and respond to security threats, along three dimensions: service provision, organizational capacity, and local social capital. I argue that militarization erodes all three dimensions over time, resulting in an overall decreased local collective action capacity and ability of civil society to insulate the public from security threats. I find preliminary empirical support for these notions using data on militarized crime-fighting policies, civil society organizations’ service delivery records, and public attitudes from Mexico and Colombia from 2006 to 2023. This project contributes to debates about militarizing public security and has implications for preserving civil society in times of threat.","Keywords: security, collective action, civil society, militarization, repression","Margaret Frost","Margaret Frost",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Rhode Island",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Analyzing Diplomatic-Military Communication Before and During World War I","How do communication patterns between diplomatic and military leadership change right before and during war? Do deliberation processes take place, and if so, when? Is it possible that European powers just inadvertently stumbled into World War I without any real discussion between diplomatic and military leadership? This so-called ""Sleepwalkers""-hypothesis challenges narratives that emphasize deliberate decision-making, instead highlighting institutional inertia and breakdowns in cross-channel communication as key factors in the escalation to war. To test this, I collected and digitized the complete registers of the written communication sent from the German Foreign Ministry to the Kaiser and military leadership from 1910-1918, encompassing a total of over 21,000 register entries. This unique dataset allows a day-by-day examination of the volume, content and recipients of diplomatic communication regarding the war. The quantitative analyses reveal an unexpected pattern: a significant increase in communication occurred only days before the outbreak of hostilities, with little evidence of long-term coordination. This lack of cohesion suggests decision-makers operated in silos, relying on pre-existing plans and mutual misperceptions rather than cohesive policy. These results further qualify narratives of calculated aggression, highlighting systemic mismanagement and miscommunication as key factors in the path to war, and offering new insights into the dynamics of institutional decision-making and the conditions that can lead to conflict escalation.","Keywords: diplomacy, diplomatic communication, conflict, conflict escalation, world war 1","Thomas Nawrath","Thomas Nawrath",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt University of Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0762_1502_0420.html","Addressing bias in subnational conflict research: The PRIO-GRID and the modifiable areal unit problem","The majority of conflict studies now analyze subnational geographic units below the country level to explain and predict conflict dynamics. This development has revolutionized conflict studies over the last decade, facilitated by the advent of spatially and temporally disaggregated event data. In addition to first- or second-order administrative regions, the PRIO-GRID, which divides the globe into temporally stable, equally sized rectangular cells, has been widely used in both explanatory and predictive conflict research as well as policy applications. However, research using PRIO-GRID largely overlooks the potential threat posed by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) to analyses conducted at the grid cell level. Different spatial units of analysis may yield divergent results due to varying aggregations of data, such as conflict events. We address this gap by introducing a flexible procedure for aggregating PRIO-GRID cells to test the sensitivity, reliability, and validity of statistical results. Our main theoretical contribution is the expectation that bias resulting from the MAUP differs across conflict types. We argue that the spatio-temporal link between the causes of conflict and the geographic manifestation of (non-)violence varies across conflict types. Specifically, we find a stronger spatio-temporal link for secessionist or herder conflicts, whereas this link is weaker for protests and conflicts over government control, increasing the bias resulting from the MAUP. We reproduce several published works to analyze the robustness of previous findings across conflict types. Our findings contribute to the literature on disaggregated conflict studies at the grid cell level.","Keywords: conflict research, subnational spatial analysis, modifiable areal unit problem, statistical bias, sensitivity","Christian Oswald","Christian Oswald","Center for Crisis Early Warning, University of the Bundeswehr Munich","Nils Metternich","Department of Political Science, University College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Center for Crisis Early Warning, University of the Bundeswehr Munich","Department of Political Science, University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0763_1031_0322.html","The Scarcity Mindset and Economic Decision-Making: An Examination of Theoretical Mechanisms","Social scientists have long noted that people experiencing poverty regularly make decisions that are likely to further deteriorate their financial situations. Previous studies have demonstrated that people living in poverty, as opposed to people not living in poverty, tend to focus more on short-term goals, put less income into savings, take out loans with higher interest rates, play more low-probability lotteries, etc., and have explained this empirical regularity using structural, cultural, and personality factors of the poor. More recently, scholars have developed an alternative explanation in which the experience of living in poverty engenders a ‘scarcity mindset,’ under which the short-term demands of limited financial resources deplete basic cognitive resources such as attention and bandwidth, leaving fewer of these resources for long-term financial decisions. The scarcity mindset explanation leads to several key empirical predictions, including that the experience of living in poverty (1) leads to an attentional bias toward scarcity-related demands, (2) leads to more deliberative short-term economic decisions, and (3) reduces cognitive capacity and control, increasing time discounting and risk aversion. The current project uses a laboratory experiment to revisit the predictions of scarcity mindset theory, addressing two major gaps in the existing literature: (1) the validity of the poverty measurement, and (2) the lack of measurement of the key mechanisms of attentional bias and cognitive load. In particular, the study employs eye tracking technology to measure attentional bias to financial considerations in a competing-information environment, as well as cognitive load when participants are considering situations of financial hardship.","Keywords: scarcity mindset, economic decision making","David Hendry","David Hendry",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0764_1134_0251.html","From Aspiration to Delusion. The Impact of Occupational Expectations on Meritocratic Beliefs","The expansion of higher education in knowledge-driven economies has boosted economic aspirations based on the meritocratic belief that effort leads to rewards. However, in recent decades, advanced democracies have witnessed stagnating occupational upward mobility. While growing evidence shows the declining occupational returns of higher education, the behavioural implications of these trends remain largely unexamined. As increasingly linked to educational choices, disappointed expectations may heavily impact beliefs in equality of opportunity and meritocracy. The paper investigates the causal impact of changes in the occupational expectations of full-time university students. It argues that negative shifts in employment prospects can undermine beliefs in meritocracy, while positive changes can reinforce pre-existing ones. To test this argument, the study links data from an individual-level panel survey with administrative data on online job vacancies in the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2024. It employs an instrumental variable approach that exploits a quasi-exogenous shock to job vacancies triggered by the introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence in November 2022. This allows us to examine how individuals who enrol in different fields of education before 2022, experience changes in their expectations due to fluctuations in vacancies after the shock for the occupations they are most likely to pursue. Importantly, the findings confirm that individuals whose fields of study make them more amenable to AI-exposed occupations display reduced beliefs in meritocracy. These results hold important implications, as beliefs formed during labour market entry can have a lasting impact and influence attitudes towards redistribution and vote choice in the long run.","Keywords: Occupational Expectations; Field of study; Meritocracy; Fairness beliefs; Instrumental Variables; Artificial Intelligence.","Gaetano Inglese","Gaetano Inglese",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0765_2411_0449.html","Surveying Populism: Do Variations in 'The People' Undermine Concept Measurement?","People-centrism is a central tentant of populism. In attitudes research, it is often measured by asking respondents whether they agree with statements emphasizing the people and their will as key factors in politics. However, the term “the people” can be understood differently based on national contexts. In most European contexts, “the people” can be interpreted in either civic or ethnic terms. The civic view sees the people as citizens of a political community, promoting inclusiveness. In contrast, the ethnic view perceives the people as ethnically homogeneous groups with a shared cultural heritage, implying exclusivity. These differing interpretations can lead to validity issues when civic and ethnic understandings of “the people” are used interchangeably in surveys about populist attitudes. More precisely, if the survey items are framed mainly in an ethnic notion, it may skew responses from populist radical right voters, who may score high not because of populism but due to their nativism or nationalism. It is crucial to distinguish between these constructs, as populism is often confused precisely with nativism, usually under the populist radical right umbrella. To explore this, we conducted a split-ballot wording experiment that varied the terminology used for “the people” in populist attitude items, using Croatia as an illustrative case study. Preliminary results indicate that populist radical right voters score higher with ethnic terminology, raising important questions about the content validity of populist attitude scales across different contexts.","Keywords: Wording experiment, populist attitudes, the people","Bartul Vuksan-Ćusa","Bartul Vuksan-Ćusa",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autonoma de BarcelonaUniversity of Zagreb",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Changing party positions on foreign policy during critical events in nine parliamentary democracies","Parties in parliament change and adapt their behaviour according to the context they operate in. While the influence of the institutional as well as economic context has been the subject of much research, we focus on combining those with an events-based approach. We assume that when events that require a quick reaction take place, parties will act more internally united. While government parties move closer to the expressed position of their respective minister, opposition parties will use this opportunity to present themselves as an alternative to the government, and express criticism. In order to test this theory, we look at speeches in parliament about foreign policy in nine different countries between 1990 and 2022. Although existing research often associates foreign policy with unity and national interests, this view overlooks the role of parties as pivotal decision-makers in shaping foreign policy. We differentiate between events such as foreign assignments, terrorist attacks or international summits as well as their severity. Applying text-as-data methods to scale party positions we find that members of governing parties increase intra- and inter-party cohesion, thus showing a rally effect. The same is not true for opposition parties, where the type of event influences a party’s response. Our findings shed new light on the influence of different types of evens when explaining party behaviour in parliament.","Keywords: parliament, text-as-data, events, government, opposition","Sophie Suda","Sophie Suda","University of Basel","Christina Stremming","University of Greifswald","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Basel","University of Greifswald",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0767_2513_0536.html","Who defends the rule of law? Evidence from the Polish Constitutional Tribunal’s abortion ban","When do politicians mobilize for the rule of law? A key challenge for resilience to democratic backsliding is that citizens often perceive threats to democracy and the rule of law, such as the erosion of judicial independence, as abstract and distant. We argue that rulings on highly politicized issues provide politicians with opportunities to mobilize opposition and generate public backlash. This paper examines Polish politicians’ reactions to a ruling by the Polish Constitutional Tribunal in 2020, which effectively imposed an almost complete abortion ban. Relying on an original dataset of more than 5,000 rule-of-law-related tweets by Polish MPs between December 2018 and December 2022, we employ a difference-in-differences design to analyze how male and female politicians engaged with the rule of law before and after the ruling. We find evidence for long-lasting and strongly gendered reaction patterns to the abortion ruling. Female opposition MPs, in particular, engaged extensively with rule-of-law-related issues following the decision, more so than male opposition MPs. Contrasting our findings with reactions to other significant court rulings before and after the Tribunal’s abortion ban, we find that female opposition MPs persistently showed greater engagement with the rule of law in general, even beyond abortion-related matters. The results highlight the importance of linking abstract threats to judicial independence to concrete, salient issues that resonate with citizens.","Keywords: courts, democratic backsliding, rule of law, Poland","Tilko Swalve","Tilko Swalve","Leiden University","Dominic Nyhuis","University of Hannover","Philipp Köker","University of Hannover","Christoph Hönnige","University of Hannover","Merle Huber","University of Hannover","","","","","","","","","","","Leiden University","University of Hannover",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0768_0702_0575.html","The effect of recurrent and concurrent climate events on migration: Evidence from Bangladesh","Various studies predict large environmental migration flows due to climate change, yet the ex post empirical evidence for such migration is inconclusive. In particular, we lack robust evidence on the impact of repeated and concurrent climate events on migration. For instance, a climate event such as a flood might not lead to migration if it occurs once, but might make people move if it occurs several times in a row, or if it occurs in combination with another climate event, such as a storm. We investigate these questions relying on original survey panel data of 1537 household heads residing along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, an area heavily affected by environmental changes. We relate respondents’ self-reported affectedness by riverbank erosion and floods in three consecutive monsoon seasons to their likelihood to migrate. We find that affectedness by erosion significantly increases the likelihood of migration. However, this effect gets weaker if households are affected repeatedly. Flooding has a negative effect, which becomes significantly stronger for repeated exposure. In terms of concurrent events, respondents who are affected severely by both flooding and erosion in the same monsoon season are more likely to migrate than those affected by only one of the two. A decline in socio-economic status after suffering repeated or concurrent impacts might lead to “trapped populations”. These findings have significant policy implications by underlining that repeated and concurrent affectedness by environmental shocks might reduce out-migration from vulnerable regions.","Keywords: environmental migration; riverbank erosion; floods; surveys; Bangladesh","Vally Koubi","Jan Freihardt","ETH Zurich","Vally Koubi","ETH Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is disagreement on the scope and relevance of this cleavage: Some scholars argue that it involves only a minority of radical voters and parties. Others contend that it increasingly also structures competition between mainstream parties, and some even argue that is has become a dominant cleavage, similar to the class cleavage in the 20th century.In this study, we use two original surveys to a) assess the extent of cleavage formation across West European countries, and b) to explain cross-national variance. In both surveys, we measure voters’ perception of group-party representation, i.e. we observe how voters link universalistic and particularistic group identities to parties.In a first empirical step, we use 2024 EES data to observe citizens “mental maps” of group-party representation across EU countries, studying the scope of cleavage formation. Second, we use in-depth data from four countries to explain this variation. We probe two explanations: cleavage sequencing, whereby old group identities linked to the class cleavage lose ground but continue to structure mental maps of representation - especially among older voters; and generalized politicization, i.e. the extent to which the new cleavage structures citizens’ thinking about representation even among voters of moderate parties and with lower political knowledge and interest, who are not implicated on antagonist sides of the new cleavage.","Keywords: political identities, party systems, cleavage formation","Silja Haeusermann","Silja Haeusermann","University of Zurich"," Delia Zollinger","University of Zurich"," Simon Bornschier","University of Zurich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, previous research shows that citizens’ expectations are often biased through wishful thinking. Additionally, not all voters are equally skilled at forming accurate expectations. Based on a survey experiment this study investigates whether offering monetary incentives for accurate expectations can reduce bias and increase the accuracy of voters’ expectations. It also examines how this effect varies across different groups of voters. For this, the study uses original survey data from the 2025 German federal election and a second-order state election in 2024. By combining first-past-the-post districts with proportional representation, Germany’s electoral system provides a valuable setting to analyze voter expectations in different electoral contexts. The survey includes eliciting voters’ expectations on the district winner, parties’ vote shares, whether a party will be represented in parliament and who will become chancellor. In a survey experimental set-up, a random subset of respondents is informed that the most accurate expectations will be financially rewarded. Regression models are utilized to test whether monetary incentives lead to more accurate and objective expectations and how this affects citizens differently. The findings will shed light on how voters form expectations about elections and whether financial incentives can improve their accuracy. Additionally, the study explores which groups of voters benefit most from such incentives.","Keywords: electoral expectations, vote expectations, wishful thinking, Germany, voting behavior","Hannah Rajski","Hannah Rajski",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim, MZES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, more recent studies have challenged this fatalistic perspective, suggesting that parties may be incentivized to adopt moderate positions and reach across ethnic communities when they are faced with complex structures of cross-cutting ethnic identities and social cleavages (Chandra, 2005; Coakley, 2008) when they act as office-seekers (Zuber, 2013), or when they desire to enhance their valence appeal by appearing as effective dealmakers (Mitchell et al., 2009). This paper contributes to the research on ethnic outbidding by addressing an underexplored dimension of electoral competition in divided societies: the descriptive representation of different ethnic communities. To this end, the paper examines candidate selection at the local level in two cases—Catalonia and the Basque Country from 1987 to 2023—which present a significant variation in the local party systems and in the strategies adopted by regional and state-wide parties. Leveraging the discontinuities introduced by effective electoral thresholds in municipal elections, I estimate the causal effect of the entry of new intra-ethnic competitors on the composition of local party lists.","Keywords: Ethnic Outbidding, Candidate Selection, Descriptive Representation, Party Systems, Local Elections","Matteo Giuliani-Pedraza","Matteo Giuliani-Pedraza",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Pablo de Olavide",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0772_1997_0892.html","Credibility in Long-Term Climate Policy","Long-term targets, such as net-zero pledges, have become ubiquitous in international climate policy. While these targets often hold greater potential for significant greenhouse gas reductions compared to short-term goals, they also carry higher credibility risks. This study introduces a novel approach to evaluate the credibility of countries' long-term climate policy targets based on the temporal consistency of their pledged emissions reductions. The core argument is that frontloaded emissions reduction targets (early action) signals stronger credibility than backloaded targets (postponed action), because backloading defers political accountability to the future. The empirical analysis presents long-term climate policy credibility scores for 67 countries, based on their pledged emissions reductions in Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-term Low Emissions and Development Strategies submitted under the Paris Agreement. The analysis reveals that most countries are backloaders, planning more ambitious emissions reductions post-2030 rather than pre-2030. Additionally, our statistical analysis examines which country characteristics predict variations in long-term policy credibility. Higher levels of regime corruption correlate with backloading, indicating that such targets are less credible. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on climate policy credibility by emphasizing the importance of time-consistent targets for the Paris Agreement's success and calls for greater scrutiny of backloaded commitments.","Keywords: Compliance, Climate Policy, Credibility, International Environmental Agreements, Paris Agreement","Vegard Tørstad","Vegard Tørstad","Department of Political Science, University of Oslo","Detlef Sprinz","Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Political Science, University of Oslo","Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Where once they were conflated, it is now clear that the two concepts should be measured separately. For example, a text may express negative sentiments while also being strongly in favour of a given policy position. However, it is not yet clear how the two interact on a range of issues, and whether this interaction biases the measurement of either concept. To address this question, we turn to a large and varied corpus of texts collected and hand-coded as part of the Horizon Europe-funded ActEU project. The texts are produced by a range of actors, from elected officials and journalists to interest groups and members of the public, across a range of platforms including Twitter/X, Telegram, and traditional news media. They express both sentiment and stances on the issues of migration, gender, and climate change in nine European languages. Using this corpus to train and validate a number of text classifiers, we examine the potential for sentiment to bias stance detection in a variety of contexts and languages, and the methods which are better able to overcome such biases. As the costs of large-scale automated text classification fall and it becomes increasingly feasible for researchers to perform, our paper contributes to improving the validity of these methods and a better understanding of online political communication.","Keywords: sentiment analysis, stance detection, text analysis, social media, LLMs","Alex Hartland","Alex Hartland","University of Saarland","Daniela Braun","University of Saarland","Daniel Gayo-Avello","University of Oviedo","Benjamin Lopez Perez","University of Oviedo","Cristian González García","University of Oviedo","","","","","","","","","","","University of Saarland","University of Oviedo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0774_2601_1022.html","Effective Allyship?

Empirically, this literature draws on work showing that marginalized group members prefer allies who are perceived as authentically motivated.  We argue that the extensive focus on ally motivations overlooks the instrumental roles allies can play, a role recognized by disadvantaged group members (Manekin et al., 2024). Consequently, while motivations matter, they are not necessarily the key determinant of perceived effectiveness. We support this argument with evidence from original survey experiments on the participation of male allies in women’s movements, indicating that male allyship is associated with greater perceived effectiveness, especially among women. These findings complicate the picture of what constitutes “effective” allyship, underscoring that under unequal structural conditions, advantaged group allyship can provide instrumental benefits even when ally motivations are questioned.

While some cities have finalized their heat plans, others have yet to begin, raising questions about the factors and challenges influencing the process. This study addresses these questions by asking: ‘Why does progress in heat plan development vary across cities?’ The focus is on two main aspects of urban climate governance: (1) the often-overlooked role of politics, examining the influence of mayors and political parties at both local and state levels; and (2) the capacity of municipal administrations, which is strained by policy growth and increasing complexity.We compile a dataset of all 82 German cities with populations over 100,000 to explore the relationship between heat planning progress, governing parties, administrative capacity, and ownership of energy infrastructure on the progress of heat planning. Based on this data set, we identify four cities that vary in administrative capacity and political leadership for a case study analysis. These case studies help evaluate the relative impact of these factors alongside other indicators. Using process tracing, we explore the mechanisms driving differences in policy outcomes and effectiveness. Our data sources include expert interviews and desk research.This study contributes to the limited literature on urban heat transition governance by examining political dynamics and administrative capacity involved in implementing climate policy within multi-level governance settings.","Keywords: heat planning, heat transition, urban governance, policy implementation, climate policy","Julia Sulerz","Julia Sulerz","Hertie School"," Francesco Findeisen","Hertie School"," Christian Flachsland","Hertie School","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the public across the continent staunchly rooted for Ukraine in the earlier stages of the war, support is cooling off in various European countries. Considering the increasing role social media plays in informing citizens, we ask the following research questions: (1) what information do European publics receive about the war in Ukraine from mainstream media via social media, and what overlap, if at all, is there between the visual and verbal coverage in different countries? (2) How is the war covered, episodically or thematically? (3) How are visuals related to the text – providing supporting information, extending the text meaning, or contrasting the text? We collected about 180K Facebook posts from 48 top news organizations across 24 European countries, over two months, corresponding to the two-year anniversary of the Russian attack (February-March 2024), and to new developments on the Eastern Front (May-June 2024).

"abstract_0777_2077_1170.html","What are the attitudinal effects of moralised elite rhetoric about immigration?","Political elites are increasingly framing the debate on immigration as a matter of right and wrong. We know little, however, about the attitudinal effects of moralised elite discourse. In this paper, I investigate the consequences of employing morally charged elite rhetoric on public opinion through an original vignette experiment administered to a nationally representative sample in the UK (N = 2000). Relying on the Moral Foundations Dictionary (Graham et al. 2009), I analyse the effects of morally charged rhetoric on self-reported immigration attitudes, perceived issue salience and moral conviction. I find that exposure to moralised rhetoric has no direct effect on self-reported immigration attitudes: individuals do not update their immigration attitudes after being exposed to moralised elite discourse on immigration. Exposure to moralised rhetoric, however, has a significant effect on moral conviction about the issue of immigration, even when controlling for issue salience. This finding carries important implications. Recent studies suggest that immigration attitudes are largely stable and resilient to change (Kustov 2021; Lancaster 2022; Mader and Schoen 2019), implying that political elites exert a limited direct effect on attitudes. In this paper, I show that political elites can nonetheless exert significant influence on public opinion by moralising the issue of immigration.","Keywords: Elite rhetoric, Moralisation, Immigration, Polarisation, Experiment","Tiphaine Le Corre","Tiphaine Le Corre",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Nuffield College, University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0778_2630_1242.html","Joining the Revolution: Determinants of Elite Support for Redistributive Movements","Redistributive movements often advocate policies aimed at reducing inequality, but these groups can receive support from some members of the economic elite. What drives elite support for redistributive movements? An underlying distributive conflict requires members of the elite to choose between supporting the incumbent and risking total expropriation if the incumbent loses, or supporting the redistributive political movement and gaining political influence over the redistributive policies implemented by a successor government. In such contexts, elites dissatisfied with current economic policies—who derive little utility from the regime's survival—will find it more appealing to support the redistributive movement. In this project, we examine the determinants of landed elite support for revolutionary movements in the context of the Mexican Revolution. We use trade shocks caused by Mexico’s integration into the global economy as an exogenous source of landed elite dissatisfaction with pre-revolutionary economic policies. We argue that landed elites who were negatively affected by international competition were more likely to support the Mexican Revolution. In addition, we examine whether municipalities with a revolutionary landowner, i.e., a landowner who supported the revolutionary forces, have lower levels of land reform in the post-revolutionary period than comparable municipalities without a revolutionary landowner.","Keywords: Elites, revolution, redistribution, land reform","Ivan San Miguel, Daniel Baquero","Ivan San Miguel","New York University"," Daniel Baquero","New York University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0779_2033_1387.html","Citizens' perceptions of political discrimination across 7 countries.","Work on affective polarization has raised concerns over increased partisan discrimination, i.e., that people treat each other differently based on the political party they support. Two questions follow from these findings: First, to what extent does partisan differential treatment constitute a form of discrimination? Second, how do citizens perceive the severity and frequency of partisan differential treatment? This study investigates the latter question and indirectly speaks to the first by measuring perceptions of partisan differential treatment relative to other forms of discrimination, e.g., based on gender or race. Using a cross-national survey in seven countries (US, UK, CA, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, and Germany), we test how perceptions of severity and frequency of various forms of discrimination are influenced by individual-level factors, such as partisanship or personal experiences with discrimination, alongside country-level affective polarization. We employ a pairwise comparison task where respondents evaluate roughly 240 scenarios of differential treatment across formal (e.g., employment, housing) and informal settings. We use hierarchical Bradley-Terry models to estimate perceptions of severity relative to other forms of discrimination, as well as partisan biases in such perceptions. Overall, partisan differential treatment is viewed as less severe than most other forms of discrimination. However, we find several country-level differences and significant partisan biases in badness perceptions, as in-partisan differential treatment is generally seen as worse than out-partisan differential treatment. Additional analyses will test how perceptions of partisan differential treatment differ by partisan groups and whether country-level differences are driven by the presence of far-right or extremist parties.","Keywords: polarization, discrimination, differential treatment, partisanship","Isabella Rebasso","Isabella Rebasso","University of Vienna","Markus Wagner","University of Vienna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Vienna","University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the literature in historical political economy finds that high Protestant missionary activity leads to better outcomes, particularly for women, over generations. I use data from 19th century Egypt, where Protestant missions were one of the main providers of public services, to challenge this mainstream view, providing evidence for a” backlash effect” that took place in locales with intense Protestant missionary activity affecting value orientations and developmental outcomes in such localities in the long run. I rely on original geo-coded data of missionary stations, staffing, and associated activities of each station in late 19th century Egypt, matched with 1996 census data and geo-referenced DHS survey data of 8764 women from 1992. I collect locations of abandoned missions to construct a placebo test. The results, which show that exposure to missions is associated with more traditional household practices and less favourable developmental outcomes for women, are robust across several specifications; the impact of abandoned missions differs from that of ongoing missions. The results reveal while Protestant missionary efforts sparked a local backlash, Catholic missions had the opposite effect. Defying conventional wisdom, the denomination of the missions matters less than the contentiousness of their strategies in engaging with local populations. The analysis suggests that looking at local populations’ reaction to colonial encounters and foreign cultural influence is key to understand the relationship between missionary activity, human capital and value orientations in the long run.","Keywords: Religion, gender, development, identity, colonialism","Ashrakat Elshehawy","Ashrakat Elshehawy",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0782_1636_0148.html","Under pressure? Elite Defections in times of mass mobilization","Pro-democracy uprisings can send a powerful signal to the dictator's allies that the regime's legitimacy is shaking, which may, in turn, trigger elite divisions and, ultimately, regime change. While allying with the regime may grant elites significant advantages, such as privileged access to state resources, opposition movements typically lack the capacity to deliver comparable benefits, and their prospects for assuming power remain uncertain. Why, then, would regime elites defect to support protesters when a dictator can offer more material benefits?This paper argues that elites defect when they perceive an opportunity to convert mass unrest into electoral support, either by forming alliances with opposition forces or capitalizing on the protesters' grievances. Using novel worldwide datasets on political and military divisions and protest campaigns (1970-2022), we empirically examine the relationship between protests, elite defections, and democratization. Through cross-national analyses and focused comparisons, we find that mass mobilizations lead to elite defections when protests include multiple social groups and are non-violent. Such protests provide a ``safe landing"" for defecting elites and a platform to build electoral support for future political competition. However, the type of elite defection matters for subsequent political dynamics: civilian elite defections are more likely to compel autocrats to implement democratic reforms, while military elite defections more often lead to abrupt regime changes. Taken together, the findings reveal when, why, and how mass uprisings successfully lead to the defections that increase democratization prospects.","Keywords: Protests, defections, regime change, democratization, military","Adrian del Rio","Adrian del Rio","University of Oslo","Fabio Angiolillo","University of Gothenburg","Marianne Dahl","Peace Research Institute Oslo","Mauricio Rivera Celestino","Peace Research Institute Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","University of Gothenburg","Peace Research Institute Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0783_2175_0209.html","Gentle Loyalists and Harsh Professionals: Repression as a Signal of Bureaucratic Alignment","While significant progress has been made in understanding democratic consolidation and backsliding, the dynamics of autocratic consolidation remain less explored. Central to this process is the autocrat’s control over bureaucratic institutions, most importantly the policing apparatus. As theory suggests, autocrats face a trade-off between appointing competent officials and ensuring ideological loyalty, while bureaucrats must signal sufficient alignment to retain their positions. This paper examines this trade-off empirically in the context of Italy’s Fascist regime by leveraging individual-level data on people under police surveillance and a newly compiled dataset of historical chiefs of police (prefects). We find that prefects affiliated with the Fascist party engaged in less political repression than career-appointed prefects, suggesting that party membership reduced their need to signal loyalty through repressive actions. Further, we document the relationship between repression practices and prefects’ career trajectories, we characterise the individuals targeted for repression based on political leanings and profession, and we gauge how discriminate policing was by proxying the number of convictions. Our findings provide new empirical insights into a renewed debate on state capture by perspective rulers in nascent autocracies, suggesting that regime supporters might be less ruthless than their career-track counterparts.","Keywords: policing, repression, autocracy, principal-agent, signalling","Lorenzo Vicari, Pau Grau-Vilalta, Andrea Xamo","Lorenzo Vicari","London School of Economics and Political Science","Pau Grau-Vilalta","European University Institute","Andrea Xamo","University of Verona","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","European University Institute","University of Verona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Attitudinal change is less explored. Prominent accounts propose aggregate preference stability unless changes in incentives or dispositions affect preference formation.We study a foreign policy issue where such a change is plausible: preferences regarding arms transfers before and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. To date, systematic cross-country and cross-temporal research on public support for arms transfers is lacking, however. We hence inquire: Do European publics’ perceptions of armaments transfers change over time? Did Russia's invasion of Ukraine change preferences toward general arms export policy and if so, in what way?We investigate these questions by implementing a repeated conjoint experiment, assessing nuanced trade-offs of respondents. Our focus is on the case of two of NATO’s top-5 arms exporting countries: France and Germany. Concretely, we draw on two original, cross-sectional quota-representative surveys in both countries with nearly identically embedded experiments, fielded in 2020 (N~6,600) and 2023 (N~4000). To make both samples as comparable as possible, we employ entropy balancing. Furthermore, we investigate possible changes in effect heterogeneity.For both countries, we pre-registered the expectation of reductions in fundamental opposition to arms transfers, as well as an increased weight of normative and security, but not economy-related considerations when forming preferences regarding general arms trade policy. Our results will inform both relevant policy debate on common European defense policy, as well as theoretical debates on preconditions for attitudinal change regarding foreign policy issues.","Keywords: arms export, public opinion, conjoint, cross-temporal, war","Fabian Haggerty","Fabian Haggerty","LMU Munich","Lukas Rudolph","University of Konstanz","Paul W.

"abstract_0785_1442_1583.html","Examining the relevance of inequality for policymakers: Economic inequality and cancer mortality","Should policymakers care about inequality? Inequality has been linked to a range of negative societal outcomes, affecting life expectancy and mental health, social cohesion, violence and social mobility, with psychosocial factors (including stress) acting as the mechanism. However, the evidence is far from conclusive. In health, many studies find no association with health outcomes. Thus, whether policymakers should focus on reducing poverty or inequality remains an open question. This study contributes to the debate on whether economic inequality is statistically associated with health outcomes independent of poverty, and whether this effect is substantively relevant. We exploit the fact that the social gradient in cancer mortality differs by cancer type. “Extrinsic” cancers, those linked to health behaviours (smoking, etc) such as lung cancer, show a significantly larger social gradient than “intrinsic” cancers, those caused by bad luck and genetic predisposition, such as breast cancer. Intrinsic cancers, therefore, serve as placebo test for the effect of socioeconomic factors on cancer mortality operating via health behaviours. We show that economic inequality is correlated with cancer mortality for the most extrinsic cancers - lung, liver, and oesophagus – but not for intrinsic cancers; and that the predicted effect of economic inequality is lower than that of average household income for all cancers (except liver). Thus, we conclude that economic inequality affects cancer mortality via its effect on health behaviours. As such, policymakers should focus on extrinsic cancers, with the greatest impact achieved by focusing on poverty reduction and the link to adverse health behaviours.","Keywords: inequality, mortality, cancer, causal mechanism, public policy","Matthew Shaikh","Thomas Plümper","Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)"," Matthew Shaikh","Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I counter this narrative by showing how the diffusion of data-based business models can create alliances between small and big companies, and companies belonging to greatly different sectors. To demonstrate this, I analyse firm-level preferences towards the introduction of data sharing regulation in the EU, particularly a right to data portability for Internet-of-Things devices and a data access mandate for companies owning databases. My analysis shows that the firms’ position in the “Data Value Chain” predicts their preferences on these proposals: firms that are data holders (producing and selling data or data-related services to other companies) oppose data sharing regulation, while data reusers (seeking access to data from other companies) support such mandates. Crucially, the results hold regardless of the sector, size or nationality of firms, thus demonstrating that the position on the Data Value Chain is a variable driving regulatory preferences regardless of the type of firms. The study contributes to the understanding of how digital supply chains change firms’ interests and behaviour, potentially shaping new coalitions between firms, governments and citizens.","Keywords: digital, business, preferences, data sharing, eu","Matteo Nebbiai","Matteo Nebbiai",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding how voters’ ideological fit within their region affects susceptibility to framing is critical for addressing political polarization globally.In a pre-registered U.S. survey experiment (N = 2,978) conducted before the 2024 presidential elections, we examined how partisan minority status moderates framing effects on attitudes toward transgender rights legislation. Participants were randomly assigned to two framing of pro-transgender legislation adopted — liberal (equality/well-being), conservative (traditional values)—or a control condition. Minority/majority status was defined as congruence between respondent's ideological strength and state-level voting patterns (extent of electoral partisan domination), identifying strong minorities, strong majorities, and those in between.Our findings revealed a non-linear moderation of framing effects on support for transgender rights legislation (linear β = -4.63; quadratic β = 1.58, 95% CI: [0.79, 2.38]). Individuals in intermediate positions showed reduced attitude extremity compared to controls. However, framing amplified extreme attitudes for both strong majorities and minorities: it increased extremity by 2% for strong minorities and about 4% for strong majorities.These results suggest that framing may inadvertently amplify polarization, pushing both ideological minorities and majorities toward extremes. This highlights the risks of framing in political communication, particularly on divisive issues.","Keywords: framing, partisanship, attitudes, subnational politics","Georgy Tarasenko, Natalia Bogatyreva","Georgy Tarasenko","Cornell University","Natalia Bogatyreva","University of Basel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University","University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0788_0919_0448.html","Informing about gender inequality: Beliefs about the gender pay gap and support for gender equality policies","Labour markets in most European countries continue to be characterized by substantial earnings differences between men and women, yet policies aimed at reducing these inequalities often lack popular support. We suggest that people’s beliefs about the size and the source of these inequalities might be crucial to explain why individuals support or oppose gender equality policies. Scholars emphasizing the importance of inequality aversion and gendered labour market segregation suggest that people likely underestimate the size of the gender pay gap and would increase support for gender equality policies if adequately informed. Another branch in the literature, however, suggests that this expectation may be misguided as people do not dislike inequality per se but only inequality they deem unjustified. Thus, informing individuals about the overall gender wage gap might be insufficient to shift their policy preferences, as many may attribute these pay differences to women's choices rather than to systematic disadvantages in the labour market. This study empirically tests these two theoretical arguments using a preregistered cross-national information provision experiment. The experiment, currently fielded in Germany and planned for the US and Sweden in January 2025, informs participants about gender inequality in pay within their country, varying both the size (low vs. high) and the type (unadjusted vs. within-job adjusted) of gender pay information presented. Using this data, we examine whether different types of gender pay gap information can increase support for gender equality policies and investigate whether factors such as issue salience, misinformation, or justice beliefs drive these effects.","Keywords: gender pay gap, inequality, survey experiment, social justice, policy preferences","Cristóbal Moya","Fabian Kalleitner","Department of Sociology, LMU Munich","Jule Adriaans","Faculty of Sociology, Bielefeld University","Sandra Bohmann","German Socio-Economic Panel Study, DIW Berlin","Ole Brüggemann","Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality, University of Konstanz; Department of History & Sociology, University of Konstanz","Cristóbal Moya","German Socio-Economic Panel Study, DIW Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","Department of Sociology, LMU Munich","Faculty of Sociology, Bielefeld University","German Socio-Economic Panel Study, DIW Berlin","Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality, University of Konstanz","Department of History & Sociology, University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, its inherent stability can counter efforts to undermine democratic institutions. Pork-barrel politicians, reliant on electoral systems for their survival, have a vested interest in preserving these systems, unlike programmatic politicians who may be more susceptible to co-optation by authoritarian forces.This study examines the role of legislators during the final phase of army-led democratic backsliding in Japan (1940–1945). Using digitized records from the 75th to 85th legislatures of the Imperial Diet, I categorized proposals, motions, petitions, and questions as sector-specific, constituency-specific, or programmatic. Legislative minutes were analyzed to measure comment frequency and speech length on pork-barrel and programmatic topics, providing insights into legislators’ priorities (pork-barrel vs. programmatic politics) and productivity (total output). The Imperial Diet’s partially lottery-based committee assignment system was employed as an instrumental variable to identify opportunities for pork-barrel politics. Election results from 1937 and 1942 were also digitized and analyzed.The findings indicate that pork-barrel politicians were (1) less likely to align with the army, (2) more likely to run as independents in the 1942 election, (3) more likely to increase their vote share in 1942 compared to 1937, even amidst a pro-army wave, and (4) less likely to attain cabinet positions. Additionally, a case study illustrates how the army co-opted Socialist legislators by adopting their policies.In fragile and unstable democracies, pork-barrel politics may act as a stabilizing force, enabling politicians to maintain independent stances without fear of severe electoral repercussions.","Keywords: Historical Political Economy, Fragile Democracy","Makoto Fukumoto","Makoto Fukumoto",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Waseda University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While extensive research has examined attitudes toward migrants moving from the Global South to the Global North, preferences regarding reverse migration remain underexplored. To address this gap, we employ a conjoint experiment to systematically assess how key attributes of migrants—such as nationality, occupation, income level, reasons for migration, and cultural assimilation—shape public attitudes in a Global South setting.Using survey data from Colombia, Costa Rica and Brazil, we test whether individuals differentiate between migrants based on perceived economic contributions, cultural fit, or other demographic and contextual factors. We also evaluate how these preferences intersect with broader socio-political dimensions, including attitudes toward globalization, nationalism, and inequality. This study sheds light on the underexamined dynamics of migration preferences in the Global South and contributes to a deeper understanding of how perceptions of power, economic status, and cultural exchange shape public opinion on migration flows in a rapidly globalizing world.","Keywords: immigration, Global South, experiments, preferences","Ignacio Jurado","Ignacio Jurado","Carlos III-Juan March Institute/University Carlos III of Madrid"," Josep Serrano-Serrat","Carlos III-Juan March Institute/University Carlos III of Madrid","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Carlos III-Juan March Institute/University Carlos III of Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0791_2467_0638.html","Class identity, class-based appeals and political decision making","A growing literature has shown that group-based appeals are an increasingly important aspect of political campaigns. The basic assumption is that group identities structure the way people make sense of politics and are essential to voters' relationships with their parties. However, while most studies compare different groups, we still have little knowledge about the consequences of appeals to specific groups, in particular social class. Moreover, observational and experimental studies have so far focused on electoral campaigns and voting outcomes. This study examines how class-based appeals influence voters’ support for and evaluation of policies in a realistic direct democratic setting. Drawing on social identity theory, we explore the effects of group-centered arguments, as well as the mechanisms through which they shape political decision-making among individuals from different social classes. We develop a survey experiment that tests how class appeals could shift evaluations from individual cost-benefit reasoning toward group-based considerations and shared interests. In a two-wave panel, we study the upcoming Swiss initiative “Initiative für eine Zukunft”, which proposes a 50% tax on inheritances exceeding 50 million Swiss francs. The first wave includes all pre-treatment variables, in particular the respondents’ social class. The second wave includes our survey experiment, where the treatment is the class-based appeal. We are specifically interested in heterogeneous group effects. Finally, we use quantitative text analysis to study the respondents’ own assessment of the decision-making process.

In direct democratic campaigns, citizens' vote choices are shaped by two critical factors: party cues and positions on arguments for or against a proposal. However, previous research often overlooks the interplay between these factors. First, these factors are not independent, they interact during political campaigns. Second, this interaction is dynamic, as citizens learn and adapt their opinions throughout the campaign. Based on motivated reasoning theory, we hypothesize that voters whose positions on policy arguments conflict with their perception of their preferred party's vote recommendation prioritize the latter. We test this hypothesis on three-wave panel data from two direct democratic votes in California and two in Switzerland. Contrary to our expectations, substantive evaluations of ballot measures override party cues, which only take the lead when voters lack strong positions on policy arguments. The results have strong implications for the role of information in direct democracy.","Keywords: information processing, political campaigns, direct democracy, voting behavior","Adrien Petitpas","Andrea Barbieri","University of Geneva"," Adrien Petitpas","University of Geneva"," Pascal Sciarini","University of Geneva","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Geneva",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gender issues are multifaceted, and their political salience waxed and waned over time. Yet, we still lack of gender-issues politicisation, and the reasons behind it. In this paper, thus, we provide the first longitudinal and comparative assessment of how political parties engage with gender-related issues, mapping the salience attached to gender-related issues by parties, and their positions on said topics. Based on salience theory, we argue that parties decide strategically whether to emphasize gender-related issues or not. Moreover, beyond mere strategic considerations (related to the vote-, office- and policy-seeking nature of political parties), we assume that the context where parties compete in is an additional, moderating factor affecting the politicisation of gender-related issues. To study these and related research questions and hypotheses, we exploit the data from the Horizon Europe funded UNTWIST project where we code party manifestos from six countries published between 2004 and 2021 according to a novel coding scheme and procedure developed to measure the salience and positioning of parties on gender-related goals, issues and policies.

The decision sparked an outcry in the human rights community and was widely seen as evidence of China’s influence over the HRC. More generally, the anecdote raises the broader question of whether and how powerful illiberal states succeed in undermining key liberal international norms.Building on the norm dynamics literature in International Relations, we argue that illiberal states act as norm entrepreneurs with the capacity to proactively develop and spread rival norms in line with their own interests. We derive hypotheses about the types of norms that illiberal states promote, the international fora that they use, the tools of statecraft that they employ, and the effectiveness of their illiberal norm promotion.We test these hypotheses by introducing HR-RES, the most comprehensive dataset of human rights resolutions to date, covering the universe of HRC decisions with granular resolution-specific information (sponsors, topic classifications, votes cast, full resolution texts, etc.). Developing new measures for the human-rights friendliness of resolutions based on natural language processing, we find evidence for our hypotheses in panel regressions: Illiberal states like China systematically promote illiberal norms while consistently undermining human-rights friendly resolutions. Receiving Chinese aid and bilateral bailouts predicts voting alignment with China on resolutions with illiberal content; intangible tools of statecraft are ineffective. Topic modeling suggests a gradual shift in resolution content consistent with illiberal influence over the HRC.","Keywords: Human Rights, United Nations (UN), Vote Buying, China, Liberal International Order","Valentin Lang","Valentin Lang","University of Mannheim","Christoph Steinert","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Mannheim","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A common practice for large-scale projects is to use supervised machine learning to identify theoretical concept of interest in the data – by manually annotating a subset of the data, using the annotations to train a machine learning classifier, and using the trained classifier to predict the concept in the remaining unannotated data. Past research has mostly used textual input features when training supervised classifiers for multimodal data, yet recent advances facilitate leveraging both text and visual features. However, little is known about whether, and the conditions under which, multimodal approaches can help boost performance and improve measurement.

"abstract_0796_2707_1025.html","Women's Movements, Identities and Appeals: How to Motivate Participation?","Social movements allow groups of citizens to address and communicate their grievances and can be initiators of change that advances their position in society. However, mobilizing an effective movement capable of achieving its objectives is not straightforward. Movement leaders face a strategic challenge regarding the identity framing they favor in their appeals when microtargeting is difficult: Should they adopt a broad, inclusive identity frame or a more specific, intersectional identity approach? A broad appeal can attract widespread support and face less opposition, but risks higher collective action problems, overlooking urgent grievances, and disengaging vulnerable members of the broader group. Conversely, a specific identity appeal may resonate more with marginalized subgroups and reduce collective action problems by focusing on a smaller base, but it risks alienating influential allies and limiting overall effectiveness. Although existing evidence from the U.S. and conventional wisdom suggest that broad appeals are generally more successful, this study challenges that assumption. Focusing on Chile’s women’s movement opposing violence against women (VAW), I demonstrate that while leaders predominantly favor encompassing identity appeals (women), experimental evidence shows that identity-specific appeals (targeting poor or Indigenous women) significantly enhance engagement among targeted groups without reducing support from broader audiences. I further argue that this effect is driven by high levels of gendered linked fate, fostered by the movement’s efforts to cultivate collective identity and solidarity, particularly among less vulnerable women.","Keywords: Comparative Politics of Low and Middle Income Countries, Experimental Research, Political Behavior","Julieta Valenzuela Correa","Julieta Valenzuela Correa",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"NYU",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0797_2446_1389.html","Does social capital reduce affective polarization?","Recent evidence underscores the detrimental impact of affective polarization on democracy, making it imperative to understand its underlying causes. This article explores the role of social capital in mitigating affective polarization. We argue that social capital fosters connections across diverse societal groups and promotes pluralism and tolerance for different worldviews, thereby reducing affective polarization. To test this hypothesis, we employ two empirical approaches. At the individual level, we examine whether citizens with greater civic engagement, measured through associational membership and volunteering, are less affectively polarized using longitudinal data from the Dutch LISS panel (2007–2024). At the macro level, we assess whether countries with higher social capital are less affectively polarized, leveraging data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) and original smooth country-year panels of social capital, estimated by combining data from multiple international surveys. Our findings will have crucial implications for safeguarding democracy in polarized societies.","Keywords: affective polarization, social capital, civic engagement","Julian Erhardt","Julian Erhardt","Paris Lodron University of Salzburg","Maximilian Filsinger","Université Catholique de Lille","Annika Schuster","Paris Lodron University of Salzburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Paris Lodron University of Salzburg","Université Catholique de Lille",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0798_0367_1249.html","Do Government Audits Reduce Bureaucrats’ Rent Extraction?","Governments have widely implemented audits to curb corruption, increase accountability, and discourage patronage practices within the public sector. This paper focuses on the impact of audits on civil servants by looking at two main aspects: first, whether audits effectively discourage 'rent-extraction' behaviour among civil servants, and second, whether the audits have a differentiated effect on civil servants with family affiliations. We employ a unique dataset from Chile's 2016 financial and performance audits of civil servants and leverage the random audit assignment across 17 governmental institutions over 8,640 public servants. Our preliminary analysis suggests that audits discourage public officials from engaging in rent extraction, but this impact is small and insignificant. We find some suggestive evidence that bureaucrats offset this drop in rent extraction by either extracting rent from other sources of government activities or by increasing the amount involved in current ones.","Keywords: Corruption; Patronage; Audits","Felipe Torres Raposo","Felipe Torres Raposo","London School of Economics and Political Science","Luis Soto Tamayo","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economics and Political Science","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0799_2055_1556.html","Mediatized Radical Flank Effects: How Radical Protests Affect Media Portrayals of Social Movements","Social movements can either benefit from or suffer due to the existence of radical flanks. The radical actions of these flanks can position the main protest actor as a viable and moderate alternative, or conversely, the presence of such flanks can lead to the movement's disrepute. While political sociology has extensively studied these so-called radical flank effects, most research has focused on individual-level effects—specifically, how citizens' assessments change—or on protest outcomes, such as how radical flanks may influence a movement's policy success. This paper explores an additional dimension of radical flank effects: the impact of radical flanks on media reporting about the movement. The portrayal of protest actors is crucial for shaping public and elite attitudes towards them; thus, we argue that a mediatized flank effect is a key determinant of how flank effects manifest. This study examines how protest events from radical flanks, such as Last Generation and the German spin-off of Extinction Rebellion, influence media coverage of Fridays for Future (FFF) in Germany, concentrating on the movement's visibility and potential negative framing in the media. We analyze protest event data and media reports from five national outlets between 2019 and 2024, employing text-as-data methods and auto-regressive models for our analysis.","Keywords: protest, media framing, environmental movement, text-as-data,","Sophia Hunger, Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti","Sophia Hunger","University of Bremen; WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Carina Siebler","Central European University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bremen","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Central European University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0800_0040_0155.html","Speaking Out Against Climate Disaster Injustices: Understanding Political, Spatial, and Temporal Dynamics of Protests by Weather Disaster Victims in India","Communities often take to the streets when dissatisfied with government responses to disastrous weather events, particularly in the Global South, where the impacts are most severe. However, organizing protests faces numerous political and logistical challenges. Concerns about political repercussions may deter citizens, and some disaster locations lack the visibility needed to mobilize effective protests. Consequently, even widespread dissatisfaction does not always lead to immediate demonstrations. Despite awareness of these dynamics, systematic knowledge remains limited. In what political contexts does weather-related discontent most frequently lead to protests? How long does it typically take for mobilization to occur, and where are these protests usually held? This study addresses these questions by utilizing a novel, self-compiled dataset that tracks weather-related protests across all Indian states from 2000 to 2020. The findings reveal that disaster induced protests are significantly more likely in more democratic provinces and that about 25% of protests occur months after the disaster, rather than immediately. Additionally, over 40% of protests take place not at the disaster site, but in other, often distant, locations. These findings have significant implications for how scholars approach the selection of spatial and temporal units in research on this topic. They underscore the importance of thoroughly considering political opportunity structures - even within one and the same country - and incorporating them into analyses.","Keywords: Protest, Disasters, Repression, Spatial analysis","Viktoria Jansesberger","Viktoria Jansesberger",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the development of centralized states across the continent is conventionally assumed to have been constrained by geography and demography, we argue that state-building strategies were reshaped by access to modern military technology in the nineteenth century. We examine the processes of state formation through the case of Ethiopia under Menelik II to show that increased access to firearms facilitated a more aggressive and expansive approach to territorial consolidation. Using an original dataset of georeferenced state garrisons and historical polities, we find that the introduction of firearms allowed Ethiopia to expand state boundaries, secure valuable territories, and centralize authority in ways that are more consistent with bellicist understandings of state formation. The findings suggest that African state-building dynamics were more context-dependent than previously understood, necessitating a re-evaluation of the theoretical frameworks applied to the region.","Keywords: State-building, Africa, Ethiopia, technology","Martha Wilfahrt","Martha Wilfahrt","University of California, Berkeley","Leonardo Arriola","University of California, Merced","Igor Kolesnikov","University of California, Berkeley","Yosef Tadesse","University of California, Berkeley","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Merced","University of California, Berkeley","University of California, Berkeley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explores the conditions under which dictators prioritize elite performance over political considerations. Using an original dataset on the retention of interior ministers in dictatorships around the world from 1966 to 2015, we examine whether these ministers – tasked with maintaining internal security – are held professionally accountable for terrorist attacks.

Combating climate change requires citizens to recognise its urgency, make sustainable lifestyle choices, and advocate for systemic changes. As AI is becoming more prevalent, we test the extent to which its use can change climate opinions and policy preferences. We argue that AI – and in particular its personalised content - can influence climate attitudes and overcome some of the limitations of pure information provision. In this pre-analysis plan, we hypothesise that engaging with large language models (LLMs) has the potential to shift public attitudes towards climate change by delivering tailored, personalised messages at a scale. We will conduct a survey experiment in the UK to examine how dialogues with a large language model (LLM) affect respondents' climate opinions and policy preferences. These dialogues will leverage previously collected individual-level information to tailor interactions to each respondent. We will compare the effects of these personalised interactions on climate attitudes with those of non-personalised interactions and standard informational statements.

"abstract_0804_0761_0258.html","The Political Economy of Offshore Wealth: How Tax Flight Affects Taxation Preferences","Over the past decade, numerous offshore tax evasion scandals have emerged (e.g., Panama Papers). These cases have prompted significant public and policy debate on how to address tax flight, as well as increased research into the impact of offshore tax evasion on inequality. However, our understanding of the political consequences of tax flight is still very limited. In this article, I develop a theoretical framework that explains the effect of tax flight information on tax preferences. In particular, I argue that information regarding tax flight decreases individuals’ willingness to pay taxes and their support for overall tax levels, while increasing their demand for tax progressivity. To empirically assess my argument, I use both experimental evidence from an information-provision experiment conducted in the UK, and quasi-experimental evidence from an unexpected event during survey design (UESD) based on Norwegian survey data. I find that tax flight information significantly reduces individuals’ willingness to pay taxes, whereas it positively affects preferences for tax progressivity. However, the evidence on the relationship between tax flight and preferences over tax levels is mixed. The experimental results indicate that tax flight does not significantly impact individuals’ preferred tax levels, but that it has a negative influence on their overall perception of current taxes in the UK. Moreover, the quasi-experimental results suggest that tax flight scandals (i.e., the Pandora Papers) substantially decreased Norwegians’ demand for redistribution.","Keywords: Taxation preferences, tax compliance, redistribution preferences, survey experiment, UESD.","Iván Tubío Sanlés","Iván Tubío Sanlés",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0805_0535_0308.html","Regional occupational upgrading and voting behaviour in Germany","The increasing geographical polarization in voting behavior has renewed interest for the structural transformations in Western economies and their role in deepening spatial inequality. While there is much research on the success of right-wing parties in “left behind” regions, analyses of how regional economic conditions affect electoral support for other party families remain rare. Our article thus asks to what extent changes in the regional occupational structure are associated with electoral outcomes, focusing on Germany. Our study uses a 2% random sample of workers registered in the social security system to create a novel indicator capturing long-term change in the quality of the regional employment structure at a fine-grained spatial level of 330 regions. It then combines this indicator with aggregated electoral data from the German federal election in 2017 and tests different hypotheses with geocoded individual-level voting data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Our results show that both on the aggregate as well as the individual level, long-term regional occupational upgrading is positively associated with a vote choice for the Greens and the conservative Union parties, and negatively associated with a vote for the social democratic SPD. Contrary to our expectations, change in the regional occupational structure appears unrelated to voting for the radical right-wing AfD. Our paper extends the understanding of the socioeconomic foundations of geographic polarization in voting by highlighting how (un)favourable labor market development affects party support beyond populist parties.","Keywords: labor markets, occupational change, voting behavior, spatial inequality, regions","Gina-Julia Westenberger","Gina-Julia Westenberger",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Université de Lausanne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, persistently low naturalization rates limit the potential benefits of citizenship, leaving integration opportunities unfulfilled and constraining both immigrant and host communities. To address this challenge, we partnered with the City of Zurich, Switzerland, co-designing and implementing two large-scale outreach campaigns to encourage citizenship applications. In the first study, we randomly assigned over 10,000 newly eligible immigrants into treatment and control groups, delivering an informational letter encouraging citizenship application. Results showed a 41% (est: 0.025, 95% CI: 0.014-0.036) higher application rate in the treatment group. Survey responses revealed increased awareness of eligibility requirements and positive attitudes towards citizenship. Building on these findings, a second study targeted specific barriers—perceived unwelcomeness, process complexity, and lack of knowledge about eligibility requirements—via three targeted interventions. Treatments addressing lack of knowledge about requirements and unwelcomeness led to significant application rate increases of 69% (est: 0.043, 95% CI: 0.019-0.066) and 63% (est: 0.038, 95% CI: 0.016-0.061), respectively. In contrast, information letters aimed at reducing the perceived complexity of the application process had a more modest effect of 26% (est: 0.016, 95% CI: -0.006-0.038). Our research identifies critical obstacles in the naturalization process and demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted outreach in overcoming these barriers. These findings contribute to broader discussions on citizenship policy and immigrant integration, providing actionable strategies for policymakers to facilitate naturalization and strengthen societal cohesion.","Keywords: Naturalization, Integration, RCT, Behavioral nudges","Alessandra Stampi-Bombelli","Alessandra Stampi-Bombelli","ETH Zurich; Immigration Policy Lab","Dominik Hangartner","ETH Zurich; Immigration Policy Lab","Selina Kurer","ETH Zurich; Immigration Policy Lab","Dalston Ward","Immigration Policy Lab","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","Immigration Policy Lab",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While some argue that violence and/or repression quell political collective action, others sustain that it can backfire and stimulate political mobilization--the repression-mobilization puzzle. Yet, our understanding of the effect of an episode of riots and repression on electoral behaviour is still limited, especially in the context of a non-fully democratic system. This article examines an episode of riots and violence and whether, and in what direction, the event impacted parties' share of the votes. We focus on a type of violence that was neither perpetrated by the government nor directly directed towards the government: In particular, we exploit an episode of large-scale riots and violence that took place in Barcelona in 1909, where the working class protested against conscription by burning a large number of religious buildings. However, neither all churches were burnt nor the intensity of violence was equal all over the city. Our empirics rely on a new dataset built using fine-grained geolocated information, including the location of protests and repression, and different indicators related to electoral behaviour. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we assess whether this violence further mobilized left-wing supporters or, in turn, made part of the middle and mid-low classes switch their support towards a law and order political party.","Keywords: Violence, Early democracy, Anarchists, Political Behaviour, Quasi-experiment","Toni Rodon","Toni Rodon","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Pau Vall-Prat","Universidad Carlos III","Maria Cubel","City University London","Santi Sanchez-Pages","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Universidad Carlos III","City University London","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Black politicians’ racial identities are generally visible, but not all parts of a candidate’s identity are always apparent. In this manuscript, I argue that Black immigrant politicians represent a case of candidates with invisible identities that are not phenotypically prominent but are politically meaningful in campaigns. Black immigrant candidates may benefit from strategically leveraging their immigrant identity in campaigns. I present two survey experiments varying the extent to which they reveal their invisible identities as immigrants. I test the effects of this strategy on candidate support among Black and white Americans. I find that for both white and Black Americans, race trumps the effects of ethnicity. Black Americans will still support the Black immigrant candidate regardless of whether he emphasizes his immigrant identity. White Americans also do not shift support based on whether it is apparent that the Black candidate is an immigrant. These results may explain how Black voters perceived and felt motivated to vote for Kamala Harris, a Black woman who ran unsuccessfully for President of the United States and who is also the daughter of immigrants.","Keywords: American politics, Race and ethnicity, Representation, Campaign Strategy, Immigration, Black American Politics, Identity Politics","Leann Mclaren","Leann Mclaren",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The Johns Hopkins University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While much research has focused on the experience of occupation, victimhood and resistance, the equally critical topic of collaboration remains underexplored in both scholarly inquiry and public discourse. This study examines the aftermath of wartime collaboration in Denmark, focusing on its long-term political and societal legacies. Leveraging the Bovrup list—a unique dataset of 18,700 Danish Nazi Party members including names, occupations, and addresses—we use party member presence as a proxy for local Nazi sympathy to investigate its effects on post-war electoral outcomes and political attitudes. We geolocate Bovrup list members to generate locality-based measures of Nazi sympathy, which we connect to historical electoral results and survey data. The analysis explores whether areas with higher concentrations of party members exhibit distinct political trajectories, such as shifts in voter behavior or attitudes toward democracy. By focusing on Denmark, this study provides a framework for examining similar dynamics in other occupied nations, contributing to broader debates about how wartime collaboration shapes democratic resilience and public perceptions of governance.","Keywords: Voting behavior, Elections, Historical legacy, Nazi occupation, Denmark","Frederik Thieme","Salma Mahamed","Copenhagen Business School","Frederik Thieme","Humboldt University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copenhagen Business School","Humboldt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While existing research has extensively examined the factors shaping youth participation, many of these influences are structural and resistant to change. This study investigates how the complexity of political decisions affects voter engagement, leveraging exogenous variation across over 20 Swiss ballot votes. Using official registry data from the canton of St. Gallen, we find that first-time voters exposed to ballot issues with greater political clarity demonstrate higher rates of subsequent participation. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect systematically varies based on the level of political engagement in young voters' households.

To fill this gap in the literature, this paper studies Europeans’ perception of “Europeanness” through a two-step process. First, we conducted a qualitative text analysis to explore how German citizens describe Europeans and non-Europeans in their own words. In a representative survey, respondents identified traits and behaviors they associate with being European and characteristics that they think exclude someone from being European. Using latent semantic scaling, we analyzed the relationship between open responses and ethnic (e.g., birthplace, religion, skin color) and civic (e.g., values, democratic support) understandings of European identity. This reveals key traits used to define “ingroup” and “outgroup” membership, reinforcing the ethnic-civic dichotomy in European identity. In the second step, we used the categories from the semantic scaling to conduct a conjoint experiment. Participants evaluate hypothetical profiles differing in civic and ethnic attributes, indicating whether they consider the social prototypes European or not. This enhances our understanding of  European membership criteria and helps us distinguish between those with a more exclusive or inclusive understanding of who is European, as well as the characteristics they use to make this distinction. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the diverse nature of European identity and its impact on European integration from the perspective of German citizens, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional survey methods with predefined answer categories.","Keywords: European Identity, Subjective Perception, Conjoint Experiment, Europeanness, Ethnic-Civic Dichotomy","Isabela Zeberio","Isabela Zeberio","University of Amsterdam"," Armin Seimel","University of Amsterdam"," Theresa Kuhn","University of Amsterdam","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0812_0721_0822.html","Group Pressure? The Dynamics of Party Competition over Social Identities","Social group identities play an important role in structuring voters’ political behaviour. Recognising this, political parties strategically reference these identities in their communications to shape voters' perceptions of parties and candidates. Yet we know little about how inter-party competition and public debate affect the dynamics of group references in party communication. Viewing parties' group references through the lens of issue competition and issue convergence, we hypothesise that parties respond to each other's salient group references. Social groups, however, are not only debated by political parties, but also discussed in public more broadly, and especially in news media. From the perspective of agenda-setting research, we therefore also expect parties to respond to the salience of social groups in media reporting.To study this, we apply automated text analysis to press releases from major political parties in Austria and the United Kingdom and of major newspapers reporting for the period 2010-2020. By using Vector Autoregression models and impulse response functions, we quantify how a party’s group-appeals are influenced by other parties’ communication and media reporting. Contrary to expectations, we find little responsiveness of political parties to either source, with little interaction in the group agendas of parties vis-à-vis each other and the media. Instead, parties are more likely to prioritise group appeals which they ‘own’, regardless of their salience in the wider communication environment. These results have implications for our understanding of party competition, group appeals as strategic communication and the broader dynamics of public debates over social identities.","Keywords: party competition, agenda setting, political communication, automated text analysis, time series analysis","Marvin Stecker","Marvin Stecker","University of Vienna"," Fabienne Lind","University of Vienna"," Hajo G.

"abstract_0813_1139_0856.html","""Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education""","Nearly every country today has universal primary education. But why did governments in the West decide to provide education to all children in the first place? In Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education (Princeton University Press, 2024), Agustina Paglayan offers an unsettling answer. The introduction of broadly accessible primary education was not mainly a response to industrialization, or fueled by democratic ideals, or even aimed at eradicating illiteracy or improving skills. It was motivated instead by elites’ fear of the masses—and the desire to turn the “savage,” “unruly,” and “morally flawed” children of the lower classes into well-behaved future citizens who would obey the state and its laws.Drawing on unparalleled evidence from two centuries of education provision in Europe and the Americas, and deploying rich data that capture the expansion of primary education and its characteristics, this sweeping book offers a political history of primary schools that is both broad and deep. Paglayan shows that governments invested in primary schools when internal threats heightened political elites’ anxiety around mass violence and the breakdown of social order.Two hundred years later, the original objective of disciplining children remains at the core of how most public schools around the world operate. The future of education systems—and their ability to reduce poverty and inequality—hinges on our ability to understand and come to terms with this troubling history and with its implications for schooling, conflict, autocratic politics, democratic erosion, and how states consolidate their power.","Keywords: education, democracy, autocracy, state-building, conflict","Agustina Paglayan","Agustina Paglayan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California, San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0814_1479_0896.html","Governments as Reviewers in International Cooperation","A core function of international organizations (IOs) is to provide information to governments, non-state actors, and voters by publishing written reports. These reports are typically authored by IO staff, but member governments are often involved in the report production as well. Across many issue areas—from human rights and economic relations to environmental governance—states often submit comments on draft versions of report text, similarly to academic peer review. Focusing on governments as reviewers in climate cooperation, we build on the principal-agent theory and argue that IO staff can exercise the greatest control over the report text when multiple governments comment on the same sentence but ask for opposing changes; when government comments are aligned, instead, IO staff are more likely to accept the requested changes. We test these expectations by studying more than 4,000 government comments to the “Summary for Policymakers” of Working Group III on mitigation options of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By locating individual comments to particular sentences of IPCC draft text and by using country covariates to measure topic-specific government alignment, we demonstrate that IO staff discretion at the sentence level as unit-of-analysis decreases as government comments become more aligned. These findings have important implications for existing research on informal governance in IOs and they challenge conventional assumptions that IO information is free from government influence and national interests.","Keywords: international organizations, principal-agent theory, informal governance, international climate cooperation, intergovernmental panel on climate change","Lorenzo Crippa","Patrick Bayer","University of Glasgow","Lorenzo Crippa","University of Strathclyde","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","University of Strathclyde",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, I focus on women’s descriptive and substantive representation in the Slovak parliament. Having more women in politics brings different perspectives to policymaking, as their experiences and policy priorities differ. By applying descriptive statistical methods and text-as-data methods to more than a decade of the Slovak parliamentary speeches, I investigate how much female and male legislators talk about different policy areas that are stereotypically perceived as ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine.’ Consistent with previous research, I find that women continue to be underrepresented in the parliamentary debate. The difference is most visible when topics stereotypically viewed as ‘masculine,’ such as foreign trade, transportation, macroeconomics, and energy, are discussed (Bäck and Debus 2019; Bäck, Debus, and Müller 2014). On the contrary, women tend to speak more than their male colleagues in debates on policy areas stereotypically perceived as ‘feminine,’ such as social welfare, education, and health (Osborn and Morehouse Mendez 2010; Wängnerud 2000; Weeks 2009). While this might have positive implications, as women MPs likely act in the interest of other women (Pitkin, 1967), it might also signal that stereotypes are deeply rooted and difficult to overcome in public life. Finally, the study also entails a thematic analysis of speeches by the only disabled female MP present in the Slovak parliament over the studied period to explore the intersectional dimension of representation.","Keywords: gender representation, gender gap, parliaments, text-as-data, Central and Eastern Europe","Mária Žuffová","Mária Žuffová",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0817_0775_1086.html","Does Gender Enter the Ballot-box? Uncovering Gender Dynamics in Spanish Voting Patterns","The rise of far-right parties across Europe has reshaped the political landscape, with Spain, experiencing a significant shift following Vox's emergence as the third largest party in the Congress of Deputies. Despite its growing electoral support, Vox faces a pronounced gender gap, as men are more inclined to vote for the party. Simultaneously, Spain has witnessed the increasing prominence of feminism, exemplified by the 8-M protests since 2017, which have mobilised women in an unprecedented way.This study, which is part of the TwiceAsGood project, examines the intersection of antifeminist and  sexist attitudes  with  voting behaviour in Spain, focusing on data from a post-election survey conducted after the July 2023 general election. Our findings show a significant gender gap in attitudes, with men exhibiting higher levels of modern sexism and antifeminism than women. They also  confirm previous research suggesting that modern sexism significantly influence men’s support for the radical right (VOX) and decrease the likelihood of voting for progressive forces such as the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE).Our study contributes to  existing literature by highlighting the crucial role of aversion to the feminist movement in shaping the Spanish electoral landscape. Anti-feminist sentiments not only drive men to support the radical right, but also weaken  their alignment with left-wing parties. By highlighting the interplay between gender dynamics, social perceptions and voting behaviour, this study  sheds light  on the connection between sexist and anti-feminist attitudes and electoral choices.","Keywords: Sexism, Antifeminism, Radical Right, Vox, Spain","Alejandro Tirado Castro","Alejandro Tirado Castro","Institute for Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)","Marta Fraile","Institute for Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)","Susan Banducci","University of Birmingham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute for Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)","University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0818_2123_1121.html","What is the price of political loyalty? Measuring the bureaucratic competence-loyalty trade-off using university admissions test scores","Scholars of bureaucratic politics have long posited that politicians face a trade-off between appointing competent bureaucrats and selecting politically loyal ones. However, measuring this purported trade-off presents significant challenges—does it genuinely exist, and, if so, how substantial is it? In this study, I leverage individual-level data on the careers of approximately 30,000 Chilean central government bureaucrats, encompassing all hires across nearly all ministries during a centre-left presidential administration. This dataset is combined with their university admission test scores and centre-left party membership status to provide a precise measurement of the trade-off. Using mixed models to account for agency heterogeneity, I find that in lower-qualification positions, party members and non-members exhibit similar test scores. However, in professional and managerial roles, a noticeable gap emerges: party members rank approximately five to nine percentiles lower in ability than non-members in equivalent positions within the bureaucratic hierarchy. Furthermore, I show that this preference for centre-left party members disappears under centre-right administrations. Importantly, the observed gap is not primarily driven by differences in professional qualifications between party members and non-members but persists within professions. These findings strengthen the interpretation that the results reflect a preference for hiring politically loyal bureaucrats. By examining politicians’ revealed preferences, this analysis quantifies the cognitive ""shadow price"" of political loyalty, providing a novel measure of the trade-off between competence and loyalty in bureaucratic hiring.","Keywords: Bureaucratic selection, Bureaucratic politics, Patronage, Test scores, Chile","Daniel Brieba","Daniel Brieba",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both as a consequence of institutional design and the deeply divided nature of the post-conflict society, this ethnic cleavage remains central to governance and political communications. A core political issue throughout the Assembly's lifespan has been that of victims and the past. Debates over the 'hierarchy of victims' remain highly salient, as the status of victimhood is a way in which individuals and groups can portray themselves in a position of virtue as opposed to the outgroup responsible for perpretrating harm. Using computational text analysis methods and a novel text scraper, I detect and classify victimhood narratives used in the Northern Ireland Assembly throughout its existence. I pay special attention to the use of exclusive victimhood narratives which portray the speaker's own ingroup as the victim and outgroups as the perpretrator exclusively. Provisional results indicate that legislators are much more likely to use exclusive victimhood narratives competitively, with a speech being almost twice as likely to contain a contradictory victimhood narrative if following a speech from across the ethnic divide that contains a victimhood narrative.Given the evidence that victimhood narratives are especially polarizing and effective in mobilization, understanding how and when legislators in deeply divided societies discuss victimhood could be an important way to assess progress or backsliding in reconcilliation.","Keywords: Northern Ireland, Collective Victimhood, Quantitative Text Analysis","Callum Craig","Callum Craig",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Dublin City University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They also agree that there are different pathways to achieve it: one could target only some sectors, and/or use different blends of push and pull instruments – e.g. investments, technological innovation, phase-outs/regulatory standards, and/or taxation. Which combination of these policy solutions can convince increasingly right-wing and economically squeezed electorates to support net zero efforts? And how can we effectively deliver such policy solutions to citizens (by picking the most popular instruments and/or emphasizing the most popular ones in our communications)?The proposed study leverages (and validates) state-of-the-art micro-targeting techniques (typically geared to retail or election campaigns) to address a pressing public policy communication problem. Existing findings show that micro-targeting can yield important persuasion advantages (Endres 2020, Tappin et al 2023). By sequentially running (1) a conjoint survey experiment; and (2) a vignette survey experiment where the micro-targeted texts are assigned via machine-learning, we develop a new micro-targeting technique that exploits the multi-dimensionality of a message via conjoint analysis, and we outline best practices in climate communication and net zero policies that could garner public legitimacy.","Keywords: Political Communication; Public Opinion; Experiments; Micro-Targeting; Climate Policy","Miriam Sorace","Simon Hix","European University Institute","Thomas Robinson","London School of Economics and Political Science","Miriam Sorace","University of Reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","London School of Economics and Political Science","University of Reading",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0821_0131_1251.html","Talking across the Aisle","This paper presents the results of a large-scale experiment featuring natural face-to-face video conversations between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. We investigate both the drivers of self-selection into politically homogeneous conversations (echo chambers) and the effects of co- versus cross-partisan conversations on information aggregation and affective polarization. We identify a relative preference for co-partisan conversations that is explained by participants’ pessimism about the hedonic and informational value of cross-partisan conversations. Participants’ pessimistic expectations about the extent to which they can learn from counter-partisans are qualitatively correct, as they do by and large learn less in cross-partisan conversations. We show that this gap in learning is driven not by a lower potential for learning anchored in the way knowledge is distributed across party lines, but by the greater difficulty of extracting knowledge from counter-partisans. Participants’ pessimism about the hedonic value of conversations is less warranted, as co- and cross-partisan conversations are deemed equally enjoyable ex-post. Moreover, cross-partisan interactions lead to a reduction in affective polarization that lasts for more than three months after the end of our experiment. Taken together, our findings suggest that policies that encourage cross-partisan interactions with the aim of reducing affective polarization and fostering information aggregation might be more successful at the former than the latter objective.","Keywords: communication, partisan sorting, echo chambers, learning, field experiment","Egon Tripodi","Luca Braghieri","Bocconi University","Peter Schwardmann","Carnegie Mellon University","Egon Tripodi","Hertie School","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi University","Carnegie Mellon University","Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0822_0492_1309.html","Is Representation Influence? Electoral Systems and the Radical Right","Does proportional representation (PR) increase the influence of radical right politics? Most of the current literature exploring the relationship between electoral systems and the radical right argues that PR increases the radical right’s influence because it increases their representation. However, this argument mistakes representation for influence. PR is more likely to give far-right parties electoral representation, but it does not necessarily increase the influence of the far-right compared to majoritarian systems. This article explores two explanations for this. First, in PR systems, the radical rights' influence is often limited either by forced compromise in coalitions or by being excluded from government entirely. Second, under majoritarian systems, center right parties are more vulnerable to being captured by the radical right, as seen by the present state of the British Conservative Party.This article tests these arguments using the case studies of the UK as the majoritarian system and New Zealand as the proportional system. The analysis tracks the appearance of radical right election promises in mainstream conservative party platforms between 2010 and 2020. It finds that the conservative party in the UK is over three times more likely to adopt the radical right party’s policies than the conservative party in New Zealand. This suggests that majoritarian systems are not gatekeepers for the radical right as often suggested but are instead still vulnerable to the influence of the radical right.","Keywords: electoral systems, political influence, proportional representation, radical right, representation","Isabella O'Brien","Isabella O'Brien",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The large-scale destruction, loss of lives and livelihoods, need for additional resources and disruption of regular life are but a few immediate outcomes of such disasters. Given the increasing frequency and intensity of climate hazards, it becomes imperative to understand the long-term impact of these events on people in affected regions and their relations with state and community. Political science studies are, however, largely focused on citizen reaction in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Addressing this gap, I ask how citizen-state relation evolves after dealing with a disaster.I draw on citizen behaviour and accountability studies to propose a novel hypothesis: democratic states in disaster-hit regions witness a sustained rise in citizen ability to make effective demands of the government. I theorise that disasters trigger a rise in demand for information and public goods, leading to long lasting changes in citizen behaviour and relations and state.I assess this argument with quantitative and qualitative data from India - a middle-income democracy. I use focus groups, survey and government sources to collect data on citizens across multiple Indian states. I analyse evolution of citizen behaviour in disaster-hit and non-disaster regions and find results that support the main hypothesis.","Keywords: Citizen political behaviour, claim-making, citizen-state relations, comparative political behaviour, natural disaster","Preeti Nambiar","Preeti Nambiar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vanderbilt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0825_1417_0214.html","The Politics of Legibility: The political determinants of civil registration coverage","Inclusion in civil registries is key for establishing an individual’s legal identity, and for accessing basic rights and services. From the state’s perspective, complete civil registries are crucial for rendering societies legible, and thus for public goods provision. Yet, according to the World Bank, an estimated 850 million people worldwide lack official identity documentation. Existing literature tends to attribute gaps in registration coverage to insufficient capacity, with low-income countries falling behind. Yet, there is considerable variation in the extent to which different types of regimes invest in rendering their populations legible and in building an infrastructure for registration. There is also unexplained variation in the extent to which citizens are willing to comply with the state’s demand for information. Several socialist or post-communist countries with otherwise low levels of development have achieved near-universal coverage, whereas democratic countries like India have struggled with registration. How do regime characteristics shape civil registration coverage? Which types of regimes are successful in rendering their populations legible? Drawing on a range of cross-national data sources such as rates of birth registration, national ID coverage, census-taking frequency, and age-heaping measures, this paper employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore the political determinants of civil registration coverage – conceptualised as an unobserved latent variable. SEM is used to examine a theoretical model of how political factors influence registration, which in turn manifests as variation in observable measures of identity documentation. This study contributes to the emerging cross-national literature on legibility and an important challenge in human development.","Keywords: state building, legibility, state capacity, civil registration, regimes","Vy Tran, Imke Harbers","Vy Tran","University of Amsterdam; Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research (AISSR)","Imke Harbers","University of Amsterdam; Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research (AISSR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research (AISSR)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0826_0896_0364.html","The contemporary aspect of the crime of enforced disappearances","The crime of enforced disappearances is complex and evolving, raising critical questions about how perpetrators, victims, and the political context of these crimes have changed over time (e.g. disappearances by repressive states to disappearances by drug cartels). This is the first effort to create a novel typology of disappearances by systematically mapping these three dimensions using a newly compiled dataset spanning reports from 1999 to 2023. This dataset aggregates global sources to document an extensive record of these violations, enabling us to explore their evolution with cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques tailored for large-scale text analysis. Our methodology employs sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and supervised classification to examine the dynamics of enforced disappearances across different contexts and time periods. We focus on uncovering whether new forms of enforced disappearances have emerged, potentially shaped by the increasing prominence of international accountability mechanisms. By tracing patterns in the data, we aim to assess how these mechanisms may influence the strategies of perpetrators or the selection of victims, and whether such changes reflect a broader shift in the nature of these crimes. This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing a data-driven, methodological approach to understanding enforced disappearances in a globalised context. Our findings demonstrate that enforced disappearances are no longer confined to the typical authoritarian, oppressive model. New types have emerged, with the crime becoming more widespread and traversing across countries and regions, revealing its growing transnational dimension.","Keywords: Enforced disappearances, Political violence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transnational crime, International accountability","Christos Christodoulou","Christos Christodoulou","University of Cyprus","Iosif Kovras","University of Cyprus","Nikandros Ioannidis","Cyprus University of Technology","Constantinos Djouvas","Cyprus University of Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Cyprus","Cyprus University of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent research suggests that this relationship does not require total or sustained alignment. This study examines the degree of misalignment that may be tolerable in the shared construction of reality between organizations and their followers before they abandon the organization or even the social movement it represents.To address this, the study analyzes the (mis)alignment in diagnostic, prognostic, and responsibility attribution frames between two central organizations of the global jihadist movement (al-Qaeda and the Islamic State) and three types of former militants: the loyalists, who remain aligned with a specific jihadist organization; the disconnected, who have abandoned a jihadist organization but still sympathize with the Salafist movement; and the renegades, who have rejected both the jihadist organizations and the Salafist movement altogether.Based on a comparative analysis of the framing strategies employed by these two organizations and the narratives of 24 former militants interviewed in Spanish prisons, the findings reveal that loyalists show high alignment with diagnostic and responsibility attribution frames and moderate alignment with prognostic frames. Disconnected individuals exhibit moderate alignment with the first two frames but low alignment with the prognostic frame. In contrast, renegades are completely misaligned across all three frames.","Keywords: frame alignment, jihadism, mobilization, disengagement","Alvaro Vicente","Alvaro Vicente",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Rey Juan CarlosElcano Royal Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0828_1925_0455.html","Women Ballers: Football and Women's Self-Efficacy","The under-representation of women in male-dominated fields often fosters self-doubt, undermining confidence and self-efficacy. Female role models can counteract this by demonstrating that success is achievable. However, if the impact of role models depends on traits such as the likeability or relatability of a particular woman, women may feel compelled to conform to the individual traits of a single successful woman, limiting their agency and authenticity.This study examines whether exposure to diverse groups of successful women with different backgrounds and characteristics increases women's self-efficacy by fostering a collective sense of belonging and motivation. Social identity and intergroup theories suggest that shared successes promote collective empowerment and confidence across multiple domains. Accordingly, after repeated exposure to a group of successful women, women would begin to view other women's achievements as victories for all women, which may encourage them to overcome challenges and pursue their own ambitions.To test our theoretical argument, we conduct a field experiment during the 2025 European Women's Football Championship (Euros) in Switzerland. We measure changes in generalised self-efficacy in the general Swiss population before and after matches using panel and structural models. The random group draw ensures a quasi-experimental design, and the inclusion of male respondents allow us to isolate gender identification effects from national identity influences.While the focus of this study is on football, our findings have broader relevance, shedding light on how women's achievements in male-dominated fields influence women's identification with female role models in other domains, such as leadership and the workplace.","Keywords: 2025 European Women’s Football Championship, quasi-experimental design, population survey, women's generalised self-efficacy, social identity and intergroup theory","Leslie A.V.

We therefore analyze the impact of two EU Directives, which both mandate the disclosure of tax data starting in 2025, on corporate tax payments. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we find evidence that corporations are already increasing their effective tax rates in anticipation of public shaming, and that the effect is primarily driven by ""ESG-conscious"" firms.

I offer a test of the classic Tiebout model of residential sorting by studying revealed political preferences around the edges of all cities in the United States. Although prior research shows that voters do not tend to sort into neighborhoods based on partisan concerns alone, I argue that partisan differences in the demand for public goods can shape political outcomes at the borders of the cities that provide those services. My analysis is twofold; first, I take a regression-discontinuity approach to measuring geospatial variation in election outcomes at city limits; subsequently, I use voter-file-level data on U.S. voters that changed addresses to estimate the differential propensity between Democrats and Republicans to choose urban or rural residential environments. I show that support for Democratic candidates in recent presidential elections was roughly 3 percentage points lower in areas just outside municipal boundaries. This discontinuity holds in small cities as well as larger metropolitan areas. Preliminary evidence suggests that meaningful partisan differences exist in the decision to move to an incorporated city. This study is the first to examine the universe of U.S. cities and uncover sharp gaps around them in political outcomes, shedding light on the relationship between local political institutions, partisan geography, and the urban-rural divide in general.","Keywords: Local political economy, Tiebout sorting","Kyle Van Rensselaer","Kyle Van Rensselaer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0831_0341_0580.html","The Paradox of Migrant Rights and Outward Remittances","How can advanced economies best promote development in emerging economies? Recent findings in development economics and political economy suggest that remittances – small monetary transfers sent by migrants to friends and family in the country of origin – are a key source of foreign currency and sustainable development for countries in the Global South. While a substantial body of literature looks at institutional determinants of inward remittances, there is comparatively little research on the determinants of outward remittances. Scholars and policymakers lack knowledge about how migrant host countries can best facilitate remittances for development. This paper argues that granting migrants more rights in the host country could paradoxically lower outward remittances despite greater access to the host labor market. This is because greater rights make permanent stay in the host country more attractive, which decreases migrants’ attachment to the home country, and makes remitting as an investment in origin communities less attractive. Using data on migrant rights and migration openness in 28 advanced democracies, the paper shows that granting migrants more political rights in the host country lowers outward remittance flows, but that expanding or restricting economic rights has comparatively little effect. Evidence comes from Imai, Kim and Wang’s (2023) time-series matching estimator. Additional evidence is provided for the following mechanism: increased political rights lead to higher levels of naturalization, severing ties with the country of origin, and diminishing incentives to remit.","Keywords: remittances, migrant rights, political economy, naturalization","Melle Scholten","Melle Scholten",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Virginia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To test this theory, we analyze twonewly compiled datasets from historical newspapers spanning the period 1872–1911, a timeof significant transformation for China as it transitioned from the Qing Empire to the Republic.We focus on the use of “Zhongguo” as a marker of national identity and find that wars triggereda substantial increase in the frequency and proportion of references to “Zhongguo” in Chinesenewspapers.

Recent works by Weyland (2021) and Acemoglu et al. (2022) have claimed that the fascist takeover occurred due to the threat posed by the extreme left. They further add that, since Mussolini's rise resulted from this unique interwar ""red menace"", the situation is non-repeatable. In this paper, I will challenge this vision. I claim that the rise of fascism was the consequence of the collaboration between Giolitti's liberals and the extreme right. To do so, I will first show that, for the 1921 elections, Giolitti designed the common electoral lists ""National Blocks"" to include the fascists wherever he could not add his loyal followers. Then, I will use a geographic regression discontinuity design to maintain that the fascists performed better in the towns in the constituencies where Giolitti places them in high numbers, giving them publicity and legitimacy.","Keywords: Fascism, Italy, Backsliding, Authoritarianism, Interwar","Bruno Della Sala","Bruno Della Sala",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Witten/Herdecke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0834_1292_0724.html","The Generational Cleavage in Europe: Population Aging and Youth Abstention","This articles studies the salience of the generational cleavage in European party systems. European electorates have become more evenly divided between generational cohorts due to population aging. Since 1980, the share of Europeans over 65 years has grown from 12% to 20% and the median age has increased from 31 to 45. The article analyzes whether population aging is driving a structural, behavioral or political realignment based on a generational cleavage. Structural realignments are driven by the changing composition of the electorate (i.e., population aging). Behavioral realignments are due to changing voting patterns among groups (i.e., age determining vote choice). Political realignments involve changing turnout rates between social groups (i.e., young people abstaining more). The sample integrates survey data from the ISSP, ESS, WVS and EVS, including over 1 million respondents from 636 surveys of 31 European countries. The analysis measures the Lambda index for the salience of age groups in vote choice for each survey. The results are consistent with political realignments: population aging is strongly associated with a growing turnout gap between younger and older voters due to increased abstention among the young.","Keywords: cleavage, generation, voting, aging, europe, party systems","Marco Pastor Mayo","Marco Pastor Mayo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Free University of Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We first develop game-theoretical, spatial models and examine how the future enlargement may challenge the institutional structure of the EU. Second, we analyze the effectiveness of recent proposals that attempt to mitigate the inefficiencies in decision-making that may result from enlargement, such as the ""Sailing on the High Seas"" proposal submitted by a Franco-German Working Group on Institutional Reform. Subsequently, we use Chapel Hill Expert Survey data to apply our models to various Council configurations. Furthermore, we consider the impact of the enlargement on the budgetary net-contributions of member states and how potential changes in the net-contributions will in turn affect member state voting. Our analyses address important gaps in the literature, the lack of formal and quantitative studies of the impact of the enlargement on the efficiency of EU decision-making. The findings reveal that enlargement to the Western Balkans is likely to put pressure on the Council’s legislative efficiency, and that the proposed institutional reforms may offer only partial solutions. Specifically, we conclude that the ""Sailing on the High Seas"" proposal may have a limited effect in mitigating the structural challenges created by an enlarged EU. We conclude by proposing a number of more effective institutional changes to preserve the EU's ability to govern in a larger, more diverse political landscape.","Keywords: EU Enlargement, legislative efficiency, game-theory.","Christophe Crombez, Matthieu Vanderschommen","Christophe Crombez","KU Leuven; Stanford University","Matthieu Vanderschommen","KU Leuven","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KU Leuven","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While prior research shows that political parties engage in competition across multiple issue dimensions, it is unclear whether voters perceive political competition in the same way. This paper fills this gap by means of a comparative analysis of citizens’ perceptions of the structure of party competition. We leverage original survey data from ten established democracies, in which respondents were asked to position parties on six distinct policy issues encompassing economic, social, and immigration concerns. Utilizing the survey responses, we use a measure of effective dimensionality (as per Koedam, Binding & Steenbergen) to capture the number of different dimensions that individual voter perceives in their party system.

"abstract_0837_1299_0855.html","Implications of ""Raised to Obey"" for the study of autocracies and political socialization","Nearly every country today has universal primary education. But why did governments in the West decide to provide education to all children in the first place? In Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education (Princeton University Press, 2024), Agustina Paglayan offers an unsettling answer. The introduction of broadly accessible primary education was not mainly a response to industrialization, or fueled by democratic ideals, or even aimed at eradicating illiteracy or improving skills. It was motivated instead by elites’ fear of the masses—and the desire to turn the “savage,” “unruly,” and “morally flawed” children of the lower classes into well-behaved future citizens who would obey the state and its laws.Drawing on unparalleled evidence from two centuries of education provision in Europe and the Americas, and deploying rich data that capture the expansion of primary education and its characteristics, this sweeping book offers a political history of primary schools that is both broad and deep. Paglayan shows that governments invested in primary schools when internal threats heightened political elites’ anxiety around mass violence and the breakdown of social order.Two hundred years later, the original objective of disciplining children remains at the core of how most public schools around the world operate. The future of education systems—and their ability to reduce poverty and inequality—hinges on our ability to understand and come to terms with this troubling history and with its implications for schooling, conflict, autocratic politics, democratic erosion, and how states consolidate their power.","Keywords: education, democracy, autocracy, state-building, conflict","Elias Dinas","Elias Dinas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0838_1774_0893.html","The Politics of Personal Ties in International Climate Science","Like many other issue areas that require specialist technical expertise, international climate cooperation relies on scientific evidence to inform policymaking. The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the United Nations’ main body on climate science structure climate negotiations by defining the scientific guardrails for governments’ climate policies, including on mitigation, adaptation, and technology choices. Since IPCC reports are produced jointly between scientist authors and governments, we study the importance of personal ties between report authors and political officials. Contributing to the literature on informal governance in international institutions, the observational part of our empirical analysis demonstrates that review comments are more likely to be accepted by report authors when authors and the comment-submitting government come from the same country. We provide explanatory evidence that shared education and shared employment histories are a plausible mechanism that underpins this relationship. In the experimental part of the study, we draw on an elite sample of former IPCC authors during Assessment Round 6 and randomize the nationality of the comment-submitting government to be either the same or different from each of the author’s own nationality for various substantively different sets of comments. We rely on the qualitative analysis of open-ended responses of IPCC authors from our elite survey to corroborate our central claim that personal ties shape international climate science. These findings challenge the standard assumption in much of the international cooperation literature that IO information is largely exogenous to national interests of member governments.","Keywords: international cooperation; informal governance; climate politics; observational data; elite survey","Patrick Bayer","Patrick Bayer","University of Glasgow","Lorenzo Crippa","University of Strathclyde","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","University of Strathclyde",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Characterizing the Analytical Sample of Regression Discontinuity Designs","Social scientists have long recognized that unrepresentative samples limit our ability to draw conclusions about target populations. Nevertheless, researchers routinely employ Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD) in applied causal inference work without characterizing who comprises their analytical sample. Although researchers explicitly acknowledge that RDD results are only identified near the cutoff, they rarely provide a discussion analyzing whom this effect is estimated upon. This oversight has significant implications: we cannot assess whether findings generalize beyond the cutoff, we cannot improve theory development, and we may provide misguided policy recommendations. We propose a novel framework for characterizing RDD analytical samples and comparing them against the broader study population or other target populations of interest. Our approach involves computing covariate means weighted by distance to the cutoff and providing researchers with graphical tools to understand who contributes to the estimated effects. We demonstrate our method's utility through empirical applications and provide an R package for implementation.

The research employs an index designed to assess the extent to which these legislative bodies promote gender equality. The descriptive representation of each chamber is examined, with particular attention paid to the gender composition of members, including the percentage of women and men. Furthermore, an analysis of the political landscape is conducted, examining which parliamentary groups hold the majority and assessing the presence of gender-focused initiatives. This includes an investigation of whether a Gender Equality Committee exists, or whether gender equality issues are integrated within other committees. Additionally, the investigation considers the existence of gender equality plans, their scope, and the extent to which they are applied, whether to staff, parliamentarians, or both. Moreover, the study assesses the legislative output of Equality Committees, including the number and scope of legislative initiatives they handle. Additionally, it investigates the existence of protocols against sexual abuse and harassment, which are crucial elements in fostering a gender-sensitive environment. The findings will provide valuable insights into how gender equality is embedded in the functioning of Spain's regional parliaments, shedding light on areas for improvement and best practices that can be adopted across the country.","Keywords: Gender-sensitive parliaments, gender equality, political representation, parliamentary equality committees","Arantxa Elizondo Lopetegui, Sandra García-Santamaría","Arantxa Elizondo Lopetegui","Universidad de País Vasco","Sandra García-Santamaría","Universidad de Burgos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de País Vasco","Universidad de Burgos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0841_1308_1088.html","Turning the (Rising) Tide: Sexism, Relative Sexism, and their impact on Radical Right Party Support","How do sexist attitudes impact support for radical right parties (RRP)? While case studies suggest sexism bolsters RRP support, we lack systematic research across countries and socio-demographic groups. This paper addresses that gap by connecting voting behavior, gender, and psychological theories of sexism, using European Values Study data.Building on cultural backlash theory, I argue that sexist attitudes are activated when individuals perceive progressive norms as a threat to traditional values. I introduce relative sexism, a measure comparing individuals’ sexist attitudes to their country’s average. This concept highlights the role of perceived minority status: those who view their values as increasingly marginal react by supporting RRPs. The effect of sexism on RRP support is moderated by the gender equality context, with sexist attitudes exerting a stronger influence in more egalitarian societies.Empirical findings reveal that sexism predicts RRP support across Europe, with stronger effects among younger individuals who feel threatened within their more progressive peer group. Interestingly, the effect of sexism on RRP support is similar for men and women, although women are generally less likely to support RRPs—a gender gap driven primarily by older women. Individuals exhibiting higher relative sexism are particularly inclined to support RRPs, suggesting that perceived threats to traditional values, rather than absolute sexism levels, drive this relationship.This study emphasizes the importance of contextualizing sexism in political behavior. As gender issues become politically salient, understanding how latent sexist attitudes are activated is crucial in explaining patterns of RRP support.","Keywords: Sexism, Radical-right parties, Gender Backlash, Voting Behavior","Noémie Piolat","Noémie Piolat",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics (CEE), Sciences Po Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0842_2139_1120.html","From Design to Implementation: Actor Involvement and Public Opposition to Long-Term Policies","Public opposition to long-term policies often hinders investment in public goods such as climate change mitigation. The challenge stems from high upfront costs and long implementation periods, which increase the uncertainty associated with policymaking. Previous research highlights the potential of policy design, information provision, and actor involvement to address these challenges. However, the role of actor involvement during policy implementation remains underexplored, even though this stage of the policy cycle introduces the most uncertainty into long-term policymaking. This study examines whether involving different combinations of actors in policy design and implementation can reduce opposition to long-term versus short-term policies. Public administrations, often seen as polarized and influenced by elected officials, may lack the perceived impartiality and accountability needed to build credibility. However, experts, who are perceived as knowledgeable and independent, and citizens, who can enhance accountability, can address these shortcomings. In particular, their involvement in the policy implementation phase may therefore mitigate public opposition to long-term policies more than the involvement of the public administration. To test these expectations, the study conducts a choice experiment in Germany (N=2000). The experiment focuses on CO₂ storage projects, a climate change mitigation strategy with localized costs and varying monitoring requirements (i.e., 2-40 years). Respondents are exposed to randomized combinations of actors (i.e., bureaucrats, experts, and citizens) involved in planning and monitoring activities for CO₂ storage projects with different monitoring duration requirements.","Keywords: long-term policies, actor involvement, time-inconsistency problems, policy preferences","Susanne Rhein","Susanne Rhein",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I use the cases of Spain and Portugal in the aftermath of the Great Recession – the austerity era – to see how countries with similar economic hardship, political history and the same governments at the time followed opposing paths to austerity imposition. Although the Troika intervened in Portugal, evidence shows that Spain implemented more stringent austerity policies than Portugal. Why? I argue that the different types of transition to democracy - reform and continuity in Spain and radical change through a revolution in Portugal - explain their diverging implementation of austerity measures in the future. Building on Robert Fishman’s “democratic practices” concept, I expect that the effect of each transition creates a cultural legacy that intervenes in how Spain and Portugal understand the economic and policy changes of the moment, thus adapting different strategies to navigate hard economic times.

While previous studies suggest that weather exposure affects climate attitudes among the public, little is known about how political elites react to such events. We address this gap by investigating how individual party politicians adjust their attention to climate change issues in their communication in response to weather exposure. We argue that candidates have an incentive to strategically address the issue of climate change following abnormal and extreme weather in their constituency, as these events are locally confined and can heighten the salience of climate change for voters. Social media platforms are crucial in this context, allowing politicians to react in real-time and bypass the delays typical of traditional press releases. Our analysis builds on over 250.000 tweets from more than 550 candidates or MPs of the German Bundestag throughout 2021 and follows three steps: First, we use a finetuned state-of-the-art large language model (XLM-RoBERTa) to filter climate change-related statements. Then we employ a novel stepwise zero-shot classification approach using GPT4 models guided by a custom codebook to identify mentions of actions to address climate change and their sentiment. Finally, we link these Twitter data with geo-referenced weather data. Thus, we can show whether candidates have strategically exploited weather events to advance their (anti-)environmental agenda.","Keywords: Large Language Models; Climate Opinion; Social Media; Germany; Weather Extremes","Jessica Haak, Sofia Morét","Jessica Haak","University of Hamburg","Sofia Morét","University of Hamburg","Lucas Schwarz","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Hamburg","Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis reveals that election forecasts derived from options prices on the S&P 500 index consistently outperformed other methods in predicting Trump's win probability. While  experts and public opinion surveys underestimated Trump's chances,  prediction markets were prone to overestimation and excessive volatility. The empirical evidence also indicates that neither a lack of liquidity nor  traders' unrepresentativeness and/or partisan bias explain  the inaccuracies in prediction markets, and that option traders correctly priced in a 2.5% increase in the S&P 500 index following a Trump victory, which closely matched the actual outcome. These findings demonstrate that financial markets, often overlooked in discussions of election forecasting, can consistently outperform other alternatives in making accurate predictions.","Keywords: Election Forecasting, Financial Markets","Sebastian Saiegh","Sebastian Saiegh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet it is rather vague about the ways that the context of state-building, in which West European party systems formed, shaped political conflicts and voter alignments. In this paper, I provide an empirical application of Lipset and Rokkan's work in the historical context in which European party systems emerged. Drawing on evidence from the near-simultaneous formation of party systems in 25 Swiss cantons, I show that the conflict between state-builders and their opposition predicted the formation of the first cleavages, but that the later cleavages developed according to cantonal political conflicts. I also challenge Lipset and Rokkan's assertion that conflicts related to the national revolution shaped voter alignments before the start of multi-party competition or shortly thereafter. Drawing on examples from Germany, Austria, Belgium, and the UK, I show that new center-periphery and state-church cleavages emerged long after countries had allowed opposition parties to compete in elections. As these conflicts unfolded and interacted, they structured these countries’ party systems. In sum, research on the formation of party systems and voter alignments should pay close attention to the context and the timing in which cleavage structures and party systems form and develop.","Keywords: Cleavages; party systems; Lipset and Rokkan; state formation; Switzerland; comparative analysis; historical political research","Maayan Mor","Maayan Mor",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Tulane University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0847_2032_1488.html","Re-Grouping Extremism: Nazi Party Elites and the Emergence of the Far-Right FPÖ","Following World War II, Austria was divided into four Allied occupation zones, jointly governed until the country regained independence in 1955. Denazification strategies varied widely across the occupation zones, shaping post-war political dynamics in profound ways. In the U.S. occupation zone, Camp Marcus W. Orr (commonly referred to as Lager Glasenbach) was established near Salzburg to temporarily detain over 10,000 former Nazi officials. Originally intended as a means to temporarily isolate and neutralize high-ranking Nazis, the camp inadvertently served as a hub for ideological regrouping and strategic planning. Historians argue that the camp fostered connections among detained Nazi elites, facilitating their post-war reintegration into political life and contributing to the reconstruction of far-right networks. This study investigates the role of former Glasenbach internees in the emergence of Austria’s far-right political movement, particularly the Verband der Unabhängigen (VdU), a precursor to the far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ). Using archival records, I trace individual internees from Camp Marcus W. Orr, mapping their post-release movements through historical phone directories. By integrating these data with an original dataset of all national elections since 1919, harmonized to current municipality boundaries, I use a difference-in-difference design to show that municipalities where Glasenbach internees settled experienced (1) higher FPÖ vote shares in national elections and (2) increased likelihood of FPÖ candidates running in local elections. This project sheds light on the organizational foundations of far-right populism in post-war Austria, highlighting the unintended consequences of occupation-era policies on political extremism.","Keywords: Far-Right Politics, Political Extremism, Historical Legacies, Party Organization","Florian Sichart","Florian Sichart",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0848_1901_0213.html","From Birth Certificates to Ballots: How Mexico's Transition to Democracy Expanded Legal Identity","Prior literature establishes a positive relationship between democratic institutions and state informational capacities, yet the mechanisms driving this relationship remain debated. This paper contributes to this debate by examining how electoral competition at the subnational level created the incentives for democratic challengers to increase civil registration of unfranchised voting-age adults. We focus on the case of Mexico during the regime transition years (1990-2000) when several electoral reforms enabled electoral competition and increased voting transparency in local and federal elections. We argue that democratic challengers sought to secure electoral advantages in districts they controlled by informally relaxing enforcement of bureaucratic requirements to register unfranchised voting-age adults (forbearance), thereby expanding their voter base. We show empirical evidence for our argument using a difference-in-difference design, we find that municipalities won by the opposition parties were more likely to register voting age adults at a higher rate in years following the election, compared to municipalities won by the ruling PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional). Additionally, municipalities governed by opposition parties showed increases in voter registration and electoral participation in subsequent elections. Our findings suggest that similar mechanisms may apply in other countries where political participation was limited prior to democratization. Our paper highlights the critical connection between legal identity and political rights, as a birth certificate is a prerequisite for obtaining Mexico’s national voter ID card (“Credencial de Elector-INE”). Our study demonstrates that democratization can enhance state legibility by incorporating previously disenfranchised populations, particularly poor, rural, ethnic voters into the political process.","Keywords: legibility, Mexico, birth registration, democratization, democracy","Andres Sandoval","Andres Sandoval","University of Amsterdam","Imke Harbers","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","University of California San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Exposure to Political Violence, Individual Liberties and Community Safety","When democracies face political violence, maintaining a delicate balance between protecting individual liberties and ensuring community safety becomes a critical challenge. Citizens are confronted with a profound dilemma: the acceptability of trading individual liberties for collective security. Governments may respond to heightened political violence by modifying principles like habeas corpus—legitimizing arrests and detentions without concrete accusations—to address these threats. What do citizens think of laws that curtail individual rights to combat political violence? And how is this dilemma influenced by their exposure to violence? These questions appear particularly relevant in the current, challenging and possibly insecure, democratic political context.We argue that citizens’ preferences regarding such laws are shaped by their exposure to violent acts and the nature of the violence itself. Italy in the 1970s and 1980s experienced waves of intense political violence, prompting the government to enact laws enhancing police and judicial powers while restricting certain civil liberties. To test our hypothesis, we employ a difference-in-differences research design. We analyse the results of two abrogative referenda held in Italy—June 1979 and May 1981—concerning public order laws at the municipal level, examining whether exposure to local political violence between these referenda influenced voting behaviour in favour of repealing restrictive laws.

Researchers, policymakers, and social media platforms have proposed various interventions to mitigate the proliferation of low-quality information. Most existing approaches focus on content-based solutions, such as fact-checking, inoculation, and accuracy prompts.An alternative strategy is to shift focus from content to sources, providing users with evidence about the authenticity or trustworthiness of social media accounts. This source-based approach might be particularly compelling for the small number of “disinformation superspreaders” that disproportionately drive the proliferation of false information.Building on research on the effects of misinformation, this paper studies how source verification schemes influence users’ social media behaviour, their perception of news accuracy, and their political attitudes. We consider both positive effects of source-rating (such as facilitating the distinction between accurate and fake news) and possible negative effects (reinforcing negative emotions or anti-elite attitudes). We rely on two pre-registered experiments conducted in the US (with a total of more than 5000 respondents), implemented using a simulated social media tool (The Misinformation Game), embedded in an online survey. We investigate how different types of source-verification schemes (3-5 experimental conditions, depending on the experiment) influence social media engagement, perceived message accuracy, perception of platform trustworthiness, as well as various political attitudes. We also consider how these effects vary between politically contested issues (immigration) and non-political topics (sunscreen safety).","Keywords: social media; misinformation; source credibility; accuracy perceptions","Romain Lachat","Ákos Szegőfi","Central European University","Can Zengin","Sciences Po","Romain Lachat","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po","Central European University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0853_2257_0307.html","The Politics of Remote Resentments: Electoral impacts of unequal public infrastructure expansion.","Can public goods expansion generate electoral backlash against incumbents? Do voters hold incumbents accountable for policies from which they derive no direct benefit? Place-based resentment, driven by perceptions of neglect and unfair treatment, has fueled political discontent in regions perceived as left behind. A central aspect of this grievance is public services deprivation. Conventional accountability models suggest that public goods provision rewards incumbents, yet the dynamics through which grievances translate into punishment remain both theoretically underdeveloped and empirically underexplored. Although evidence links underprovision to rising far-right vote shares, this may reflect only the endpoint of a more intricate process. This paper explores how unequal public goods expansion can also provoke voter backlash in remote areas unaffected by new developments. First, using a novel dataset on hospital construction in Spain (2002–2019) and municipality-level electoral results, I analyze how the allocation of 81 new hospitals resulted in a) rewards from direct winners of this policy, but b) backlash against incumbents, driven by a sense of territorial competition in already underserved areas far from these new facilities. Then, to establish a causal link, I focus on an Andalusian 2000 plan that aimed to ensure that 99\% of residents lived within 30 minutes of a hospital. Employing census-track data in Andalusia (2000-2024) in an IV strategy, I evaluate how the proposed hospital placements generated uneven patterns of electoral rewards and punishments. This study provides insights into nuanced electoral dynamics around public goods, emphasizing the critical role of unequal allocations in shaping electoral accountability.","Keywords: Public goods, accountability, place-based resentments, territorial competition, electoral backlash","ÁLVARO SAN ROMÁN DEL POZUELO","ÁLVARO SAN ROMÁN DEL POZUELO",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0854_1117_0579.html","Immigrants’ sexual orientation, economic contributions, and deportation attitudes","This paper explores a topic that has received limited attention in existing scholarship on immigration attitudes, but that is central to the political discourse of many countries: the deportation of undocumented immigrants. We examine how immigrants’ identity and economic characteristics interact to shape deportation attitudes. In particular, we focus on immigrants’ sexual orientation and economic contributions. We investigate the topic in the United States, a country where immigration is a key political issue that has become increasingly polarizing. The analysis relies on an original survey experiment with a sample of respondents that mirror Census quotas for key socio-demographic indicators. The analysis reveals interesting findings. Immigrants’ identity characteristics play a limited but significant role in shaping support for deportation once the undocumented trait is taken into account. In particular, gay immigrants face stronger calls for deportation. However, when information about an immigrant’s economic contribution in the destination country is provided in addition to their sexual orientation, the difference in the evaluation of gay and straight undocumented immigrants becomes non-significant. Interestingly, while economic contributions strongly decrease support for the deportation of immigrants with various profiles, the effect is stronger for gay over straight immigrants. The results are mostly driven by Democratic respondents, who reward gay immigrants more for their economic contributions. In contrast, Republicans reward straight immigrants more, but to a lesser extent. This paper contributes to the study of LGBTQ+ politics and immigration attitudes, suggesting possible frames to contrast calls for deportation.","Keywords: deportation; immigration; immigration attitudes; undocumented immigrants; sexual orientation","Zoila Ponce de León","Zoila Ponce de León","University of Pittsburgh","Gabriele Magni","Loyola Marymount University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh","Loyola Marymount University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, while existing studies have explored the electoral participation of immigrants from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and the potential differences that may exist between them and the native citizens, only a few have focused on Muslim immigrants’ turnout through a generational lens and from a cross-national perspective. This is surprising considering how Islam and Muslim communities have become a silent political issue in most WLDs and while right-wing populist political actors question Muslim citizens’ commitment to democratic values and practices in those countries. Our study aims to fill this gap. Using cross-national data from the European Values Survey (EVS), the European Social Survey (ESS), the Canadian Election Study (CES), the Australian Election Study (AES), and the American National Election Studies (ANES), we will investigate the following main research questions: Does Muslim immigrants’ electoral turnout follow any specific pattern in liberal democracies? In other worlds, to what extent does being a Muslim immigrant in a WLD make individuals more (or less) prone to go to vote than being non-Muslim immigrants? Are those patterns stable through generations, especially between the first and second-generation Muslim immigrants? Do differences in turnout among Muslim immigrants exist? If yes, what explains those differences?

This study argues that by participating in democratic protests, individuals develop trust that others will join, which creates bonds of social trust that endure beyond the transition period and contribute to higher electoral engagement post-transition. Leveraging previously untapped survey data from the 1989 German Democratic Republic (GDR) revolution and an instrumental variable approach based on Stasi records, this study finds that former protest participants are significantly more likely to vote post-transition, with turnout rates closely paralleling those in West Germany. Social trust emerges as a critical mechanism driving this effect, with lasting influences extending to participants’ children, who also display heightened electoral participation. Additionally, regions with higher protest intensity show elevated levels of electoral turnout post-transition. These findings underscore democratic protests as powerful catalysts of enduring civic engagement, highlighting their role in fostering democratic resilience and stability in post-transition societies.","Keywords: protests; electoral participation; mobilization; German Democratic Republic; turnout; social trust; democratization","Zeth Isaksson","Zeth Isaksson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stockholm University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0858_1637_0721.html","Compulsory or Uninformed? How Knowledge of Compulsory Voting Rules Affects Turnout","High electoral turnout in countries with compulsory voting systems is often attributed to citizens' desire to avoid the legal consequences for abstention. However, turnout is equally high in compulsory voting contexts where penalties are absent or unenforced, which challenges this notion. An alternative perspective suggests that citizens’ lack of knowledge about the absence of penalties or their enforcement drives turnout, but little is known about the causal effect of such knowledge. This study examines whether knowledge of compulsory voting rules and their (lack of) enforcement influences turnout likelihood. To do so, we focus on Belgium, a country with a long history of compulsory voting – including high levels of turnout – but without enforcement of the legal consequences for abstention. We conduct a vignette survey experiment to analyse how factual information about compulsory voting, potential penalties for abstention, and the absence of enforcement of these penalties influences citizens’ likelihood of voting in future elections. By examining how knowledge of compulsory voting rules influences electoral participation, this research deepens our understanding of the effects of such rules on turnout in democratic systems.","Keywords: Compulsory voting, Turnout, Voting rules, Survey experiment, Electoral behaviour, Political institutions","Bjarn Eck","Ruth Dassonneville","Université de Montréal","Bjarn Eck","Université libre de Bruxelles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université de Montréal","Université libre de Bruxelles",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0859_1754_0760.html","Sweden in the EU: Depoliticization, Politicization, and the Transformation of Parliamentary Conflict","European integration profoundly impacts the executive-legislative relations within national parliaments. However, evidence remains mixed on whether the EU’s impact shifts national conflict dimensions towards depoliticization or increased contestation and politicization. This question is particularly critical in times of heightened polarization, as it affects the EU's legitimacy and the effectiveness of its policies. This study contributes to the literature by examining how the EU's regulatory framework has transformed domestic politics and patterns of opposition within member states' parliaments. We hypothesize that a country's accession to the EU permanently alters parliamentary conflict dimensions, depoliticizing policy areas essential for supranational cooperation while intensifying politicization in predominantly domestic policy areas that remain under national competencies. To test these hypotheses, we analyze unique longitudinal data on committee decision-making for all government proposals in the Swedish parliament over more than 50 years, from 1970 to 2022. Using a difference-in-difference design, we compare the scope and intensity of parliamentary opposition across all policy areas before Sweden joined the EU (1970-1994) and after its accession (1995-2022). Our findings are twofold. First, Sweden’s accession to the EU in 1995 prompted a sharp reduction in parliamentary opposition within economic policy-making that has lasted until the 2020s. Second, our results demonstrate an upturn of controversies in policy areas related to national identity and welfare, where the EU traditionally has limited influence. These results have important implications, demonstrating that the transfer of competencies to the EU has fundamentally reshaped domestic policy-making, creating parallel processes of depoliticization and politicization across different policy areas.","Keywords: European integration; depoliticization; politicization; opposition; national parliaments.","Karl Loxbo, Brigitte Pircher","Karl Loxbo","University of Stockholm","Brigitte Pircher","Södertörn University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stockholm","Södertörn University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0860_1230_0826.html","Unity or Decline: The Electoral Costs of Intra-Party Division for European Mainstream parties","Why do some mainstream center-right and center-left parties in Europe maintain their support while others decline? This paper argues that the clarity of party positions on salient wedge issues is a key factor. Wedge issues often cross-cut the diverse and broad electorates of traditional mainstream parties. This creates internal divisions that make it difficult to adopt clear, unified positions. Ambiguity in a party’s stance increases the risk of electoral losses, while a clear position can stabilize or even bolster support when an issue is highly salient. Empirically, this paper relaxes the unitary actor assumption and examines the effects of intra-party division on political support across European countries, focusing on immigration, a wedge issue that has become increasingly salient with the rise of far-right parties. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on a corpus of party Tweets, parliamentary speeches and press releases in European countries, it measures variance and thus issue ambiguity in party positions on immigration and assesses the effects on national polling data, tracked monthly and, in some cases, weekly. The findings show that mainstream parties with greater internal ambiguity suffer larger declines in support, whereas those that deliver clear positions are more resilient. This study highlights a critical explanation for variations in mainstream party decline across Europe: their ability to manage internal divisions and articulate coherent stances on cross-cutting issues. It underscores the importance of message clarity in an era when issue salience, particularly around immigration, challenges the unity of broad-based parties and reshapes political competition.","Keywords: mainstream party decline, positional ambiguity, Natural Language Processing, immigration politics, issue salience","Luis Sattelmayer","Luis Sattelmayer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Center of European Studies and Comparative Politics, SciencesPo Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0861_1779_0857.html","Implications of ""Raised to Obey"" for the study of education systems","Nearly every country today has universal primary education. But why did governments in the West decide to provide education to all children in the first place? In Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education (Princeton University Press, 2024), Agustina Paglayan offers an unsettling answer. The introduction of broadly accessible primary education was not mainly a response to industrialization, or fueled by democratic ideals, or even aimed at eradicating illiteracy or improving skills. It was motivated instead by elites’ fear of the masses—and the desire to turn the “savage,” “unruly,” and “morally flawed” children of the lower classes into well-behaved future citizens who would obey the state and its laws.Drawing on unparalleled evidence from two centuries of education provision in Europe and the Americas, and deploying rich data that capture the expansion of primary education and its characteristics, this sweeping book offers a political history of primary schools that is both broad and deep. Paglayan shows that governments invested in primary schools when internal threats heightened political elites’ anxiety around mass violence and the breakdown of social order.Two hundred years later, the original objective of disciplining children remains at the core of how most public schools around the world operate. The future of education systems—and their ability to reduce poverty and inequality—hinges on our ability to understand and come to terms with this troubling history and with its implications for schooling, conflict, autocratic politics, democratic erosion, and how states consolidate their power.","Keywords: education, democracy, autocracy, state-building, conflict","Johannes Lindvall","Johannes Lindvall",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper takes stock of progress by reviewing key findings in existing scholarship and identifying critical areas for future study. Examining patterns, drivers, and consequences of IO contestation, we advance three key arguments. First, contestation occurs through state and societal actors calling for reform, replacement, or rejection of IOs. Yet, contrary to common expectations, various measurements of contestation do not show a general rise; instead, it shows extensive fluctuation and variation. Second, contestation of IOs originates from drivers at both international and national levels, ranging from global power shifts and international authority to democratic decline and populist entrepreneurship. These drivers interact in producing complex dynamics of contestation across levels. Third, contestation has both short-term and long-term consequences for IOs. Nevertheless, overall, IOs have remained surprisingly resilient in the face of state and societal contestation. Going forward, this research program needs to further explore the origins of the expectations-findings gap, the nature of interactions among drivers, and the broader effects of contestation on global order.","Keywords: International Organizations, contestation, backlash, liberal international order, global governance","Stefanie Walter","Jonas Tallberg","University of Stockholm","Stefanie Walter","University of Zurich","Michael Zürn","WZB Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zurich","University of Stockholm","WZB Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0863_0571_0968.html","A Matter of Degree: The Effects of University Field of Study on Economic and Social Ideology Among Swedish Identical Twins","It is commonly believed that education causes individuals to become more progressive in their political outlook. However, simply measuring years of education, as has been common in the literature, risks glossing over potentially crucial differences in the content of education, i.e.  particular fields of study. Additionally, achieving a causal identification of educational effects can be notoriously difficult. We suggest an approach that leverages comparisons between siblings in identical twin pairs, commonly referred to as a discordant twin design. This allows us to distinguish selection effects from (potential) causal effects that arise from differences in field of study between siblings that share their family background, as well as their genetics. The study is based on a sample of twins in the Swedish Twin Registry (STR), which have been linked to register data concerning university fields of study, and a survey containing measures of ideology. The results indicate that there are effects of enrolling in a social science or humanities field as opposed to a STEM field, on economic and social ideology. The predicted difference in economic ideology was estimated at 0.3 standard deviations, with social science/humanities education being associated with more progressive economic attitudes. The corresponding difference concerning social ideology was a slightly larger 0.4 standard deviations. The results have implications for how we should think about the role of higher education in shaping ideological cleavages in society, since academic fields of study may in fact have causal effects on how citizens make sense of political issues.","Keywords: fields of education, political ideology, discordant twin design","Oskar Pettersson","Oskar Pettersson","Department of Government, Uppsala University"," Qinya Feng","Department of Government, Uppsala University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Government, Uppsala University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We advance this field of study by looking at written parliamentary questions to government ministers and considering sender and receiver dynamics. We ask to what extent MPs adapt their communication style to the gender of the minister they address. We hypothesize that written parliamentary questions are overall more likely to be similar in style to questions by other MPs of the same gender, and that this is more likely the case when the receiver of the question is of the same gender. We use machine learning to get a domain-specific measure of gendered language, and study 31,396 written questions asked in the Norwegian parliament between 1998 and 2021. We find support for our hypotheses.

"abstract_0865_1316_1085.html","""Man-y"" ways to be right: Generational and Life-Cycle Differences in Male Far-Right Voting","Since their early days, far-right parties are not only institutionally dominated by men and largely represented by men in parliaments and governments, but also - as research has repeatedly shown - more strongly voted for by male voters. In that regard, recent exit polls have shown that the far-right scores increasingly strong electoral results among young men. While most studies on the gender gap in (far-right) voting look at differences between men and women, they less frequently focus on differences within genders, and particularly rarely on divergences between different generational groups of men. In that regard, relatively little is known about new generations of male far-right voters' divergence from earlier generations of male voters. However, I expect to find differences between cohorts and age groups: First, I assume that newer generations of male voters are generally more likely to see the far-right as an electable option due to normalization processes and parental socialization. Second, I expect that newer cohorts of male voters are more likely to vote for the far-right than earlier cohorts because of gender-related attitudes and that they assess these questions to be more salient. To test these assumptions, I rely on data from the ESS and the EES (to disentangle age, period, and cohort) and original survey data from Germany and Switzerland conducted in 2024. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the seemingly increasing gender gap in Western democracies and help us contextualize the temporal dimension of these shifts.","Keywords: Far-Right, Generations, Male Voters, Western Europe, APC","Reto Mitteregger","Reto Mitteregger",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

New parties depend heavily on media exposure to connect with voters and establish legitimacy, as traditional news outlets remain primary information sources. This study examines how specific message attributes—such as party type, popularity, leader recognition, leader gender, leader’s political background, and message sentiment—shape journalists’ decisions to cover press releases from new versus established parties. Drawing on original survey data with a conjoint experiment involving Italian media practitioners, we find that, unlike established parties, new parties do not benefit from leader recognition in press release selection and face stricter penalties for extreme tones, whether highly negative or self-promotional. Moreover, new parties gain more media attention when the release is issued by the party leader, underscoring the importance of direct leadership engagement for visibility.

Drawing on the party's distinctive rhetoric - using terms such as 'eco-dictatorship' - the study explores the intersection of climate discourse with ideologies such as green nationalism and fossil fascism. Using the textual content of political tweets as primary data, the research examines the framing strategies employed by VOX to position climate issues within its broader political agenda between January and June 2023. Theoretically, the paper situates this analysis within emerging debates about the radical right and climate obstruction in a climate-sensitive country, offering insights into how parties politicise climate. Methodologically, we use a range of different machine learning methods for natural language processing - mostly transformer-based deep learning methods for classification - to map the salience attached to environmental issues and the positions taken by parties during the campaign.

"abstract_0868_1890_1254.html","""Adding New Districts, Adding Votes? Electoral Impact of Administrative Proliferation""","Over the past few decades, many developing countries have substantially increased the number of sub-national administrative units. The political motivation to create new districts has been theorized to be the need to signal commitment to voters (Gottlieb et al. 2019), patronage to local supporters (Hassan 2016), negotiations with local elites in peripheral areas (Grossman and Lewis 2014), and managing legislative compliance and controlling defections (Hassan and Sheely 2017). Some of these mechanisms predict an increased electoral support for the government that is creating new districts in the subsequent elections, while others predict improved party discipline and fewer defections. Using granular booth level voting data from India and a geographic regression discontinuity research design, we investigate the electoral response to administrative proliferation. We identify a subset of new districts that bisected existing electoral units (or assembly constituencies). These electoral units therefore straddle two districts—one new and the other old—while they continue to share the same elected representative and allow us to test the electoral response to administrative proliferation. Contrary to previous empirical findings, mostly from Africa, our results show that there is no significant electoral advantage to the incumbent in creating a new administrative unit. These findings suggest that administrative proliferation is a policy metric aimed at local party elites to enhance party discipline rather than as a direct appeal to voters. Using constituency-level data from across Indian states, we also test the mechanism of party discipline and avoiding defections as driving the observed administrative proliferation.","Keywords: administrative proliferation, electoral accountability, geographic regression discontinuity design","Jothsna Rajan, Mayank Dixit","Jothsna Rajan","Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"," Mayank Dixit","Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0869_1344_1308.html","Representational Quality of Minority Governments: The Role of Support Parties, Formal Agreements, and Narratives","Minority governments are a recurring phenomenon in European parliamentary democracies and are likely to become more frequent as party system fragmentation and polarization increases and as radical right parties gain strength. However, little is known about the perceived representational quality and citizens’ acceptance of minority governments. Do citizens favor minority governments with formalized support agreements, or do they prefer those without any agreements? To what extent do narratives about minority governments by parties, the media, and experts shape these perceptions? This study addresses these questions through a survey vignette experiment conducted in six European countries – Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden (N = 21,000). Respondents evaluate hypothetical minority governments presented in randomized fictional newspaper articles. The newspaper articles outline the formation of a minority government and highlight its characteristics: the prime minister’s party, the presence and formalization of support agreements, support party, the government’s policy priorities and guiding motto, justifications for government formation, and expert evaluations. Our preliminary results reveal that citizens strongly disfavor minority governments that rely on radical right support parties – regardless whether support is formalized or not. Moreover, citizens generally prefer substantive minority governments – those without formal or informal agreements with opposition parties – over those that include support agreements. Additionally, expert evaluations significantly influence citizens’ opinions, particularly when experts emphasize negative aspects of minority governments. These findings have important implications for understanding political representation in multiparty systems, citizens’ perceptions of coalition strategies, and the role of narratives in shaping public opinion about minority governments.","Keywords: Minority Governments, Support Parties, Representational Quality, Survey Experiment, Public Opinion","Lukas Hetzer","Sven-Oliver Proksch","University of Cologne"," Lukas Hetzer","University of Cologne"," Jens Wäckerle","University of Cologne"," Jasmin Rath","University of Cologne"," Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik","University of Cologne","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Cologne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While much research explores how events shape public opinion, the geographic proximity to such events and their effects on political identity remain underexplored. Focusing on far-right events in Germany, the study examines whether being near these manifestations prompts individuals to moderate their ideological stance to dissociate from the far-right. A key expectation is that proximity to far-right demonstrations affects conservatives differently, nudging them toward more moderate positions, while having less impact on left-wing individuals. To explore this, a novel methodological approach combines survey panel data with geospatial data on far-right events. The analysis incorporates proximity measures and event characteristics such as size, organisational prominence, and the presence of violence while controlling for contextual variables. Effects are assessed at the individual level, offering a precise estimation of how exposure to these events shapes political attitudes. This framework deepens understanding of the interaction between political geography and individual-level political identity, shedding light on how geographic exposure to far-right activity reshapes ideological positioning and contributes to broader public opinion dynamics.","Keywords: Proximity effects, far-right movements, political identity, geographic influence, protest dynamics","Nikandros Ioannidis","Nikandros Ioannidis",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Cyprus University of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper examines whether natural disasters trigger a public backlash against authoritarian incumbents, focusing on the February 2023 earthquakes in Turkey. With national elections held three months later and local elections a year after the earthquake, the Turkish context provides a unique opportunity to test how natural disasters affect public accountability in an authoritarian setting.Combining georeferenced earthquake intensity data with electoral results across 45,000 Turkish localities, I use synthetic difference-in-differences to test pre-registered hypotheses about the earthquake’s effect on incumbent vote share and turnout. These analyses are complemented with survey data using an unexpected event (earthquake) during survey approach.Findings show that voters hold authoritarian incumbents accountable for natural disasters, though the effects are complex and heterogeneous. In the 2023 national elections, the earthquake reduced AKP support in affected regions by about 2.5 percentage points. Turnout exhibited a parabolic response: moderately hit areas saw higher mobilization, while severely affected localities experienced demobilization due to displacement. By contrast, the 2024 local elections showed a weaker punishment effect.This study contributes to research on public accountability in non-democracies and the electoral consequences of crises. It demonstrates that even in competitive authoritarian regimes, natural disasters can expose government failures and trigger backlash. The magnitude and duration of this effect depend on disaster intensity, government responses, and the political landscape. These findings highlight the need to account for effect heterogeneities in disaster studies and caution against generalizing across disaster severities.","Keywords: accountability, natural disasters, electoral authoritarianism, voting, Turkey","Konstantin Bogatyrev","Konstantin Bogatyrev",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An experiment on land certification and conflict in Côte d’Ivoire","How does increased legibility of property rights shape claim-making during land conflict? We use a randomized controlled trial of a large-scale land certification programme implemented by the government of Côte d’Ivoire and survey experimental measures of behaviour during conflict to understand the relationship between property rights and conflict resolution behaviour. We find that the local saturation of property rights legibility matters for how people make claims over disputed property. When an individual alone experiences increased property rights legibility, it increases their willingness to appeal disputes, given the relative size of their perceived advantage vis-à-vis less legible claims. In contrast, when many community members experience a coordinated increase in legibility, the effect of holding a certificate is balanced by an overall decrease in the demand for dispute resolution services. We argue that as the overall legibility of land rights improves, the smaller the relative power of each individual land certificate, and the less demand for third-party intervention in disputes. Significant decreases in contact between individuals and local authorities in districts randomly assigned to land certification provide supporting evidence. We also find that respondents’ willingness to appeal claims against indigenous individuals afforded protected status by the Ivorian land law decreases in areas randomized to land certification, even though migrant landholders benefited most in terms of perceived tenure security. Our findings contribute to understanding how legible property rights shape land conflict.","Keywords: Land conflict, land certification, legibility, property rights","Andrea C. Caflisch","Andrea C.

However, a persistent gap exists between the outcomes desired by political elites and the needs expressed by victims. In this paper, we hypothesize that increasing political elites' exposure to victims' lived experiences and preferences can bridge this gap. We test this hypothesis through a large-scale, non-deceptive field experiment conducted during the 2023 Colombian local and regional elections in collaboration with leaders of victims' organizations. Victim leaders randomly varied the content of their communications with 100,000 candidates, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing victims' needs in policy-making. The messages varied in two key ways: some increased the salience of victims' needs, while others additionally conveyed the victim leader's stance on a contentious issue—negotiations with illegal armed groups. Importantly, one victim leader supported negotiations, while the other opposed them.Our findings provide evidence for each hypothesis. First, we show that communications highlighting victims' needs increase the salience of these issues among political elites. Second, we demonstrate that political elites' stances on negotiations with armed groups are influenced by the positions articulated by victim leaders. These results suggest that direct exposure to victims' voices not only raises awareness but also influences political elites' policy preferences, offering a promising pathway to better align transitional justice mechanisms with the priorities of those most affected by conflict.","Keywords: large-scale field experiment, elites, representation, conflict victims, Colombia","Joan Barceló","Joan Barceló","New York University Abu Dhabi","Mauricio Vela Barón","Registraduría Nacional del Estado Civil de Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York University Abu Dhabi","Registraduría Nacional del Estado Civil de Colombia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, asylum is granted to refugees after a costly verification procedure has distinguished them from economic migrants. Some rejected applicants manage to abscond and stay irregularly, creating incentives for economic migrants to apply for asylum, even though they know that they will be rejected. We propose an alternative mechanism that reduces the administrative burden of such unfounded asylum applications. The main idea is to give migrants a choice, upon arrival, between applying for asylum (in which case their claims will be processed as usual) and participating in a lottery that awards asylum-equivalent visas with some probability. If this probability is high enough, economic migrants will self-select into the lottery, whereas refugees keep applying for asylum. Hence, in equilibrium, there are no unfounded asylum applications. In a formal model, we show that our mechanism is optimal for the government of the destination country, assuming that it wants to identify and protect refugees at the lowest possible verification cost.

Using fine-grained data on the location of the refugees, we show that their presence is strongly associated with increased participation in the Resistance against the Nazis during World War II and with left-wing electoral support in the post-war period. Our findings demonstrate that migrants can be effective mobilizing actors within the host countries.","Keywords: refugees, mobilization, violence, Resistance, France","Alejandro Lopez Peceño","Alejandro Lopez Peceño","European University Institute"," Pau Grau","European University Institute","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Worker Shortages and Local Immigration Support","How do peoples' attitudes towards immigration change when exposed to dramatic declines in the availability of immigrant labor? Swiss agricultural production relies heavily on foreign labor. However, the pandemic lockdown caused a shortage of foreign seasonal workers in the spring of 2020. We combine fine-grained voting results from referendums on specific immigration-related policy decisions with variation in seasonal worker needs. We establish that municipalities growing spring crops, and therefore facing severe shortages of foreign labor in spring 2020, voted significantly more in favor of immigration in September 2020 compared to otherwise similar municipalities. Further, using text data from open-ended survey questions, we document how this shock popularized a narrative highlighting the role of foreign workers as complements to the local native ones rather than substitutes. We conclude that economic shocks can influence economic narratives and, ultimately, change attitudes toward immigration.","Keywords: Immigration attitudes, Narratives, Voting, Instrumental variable approach, Natural experiment","Daniel Auer","Daniel Auer","Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Mannheim","Gloria Gennaro","University College London","Tiziano Rotesi","Brown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collegio Carlo Alberto","University College London","Brown University","University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The electoral consequences of old and new violence, Italy 1943-1988","Historical experiences of violence influence political behaviour even during non-violent periods, although the effects of such legacies may diminish over time. However, political violence can re-emerge in democratic contexts, raising key questions: Do new incidents of political violence reactivate the legacies of earlier violence? Does the impact depend on the political identity of the perpetrators? Or is it shaped by the type of violence involved? We argue that local experiences of new violent events, particularly those perpetrated in areas with historical exposure to violence from actors within the same ideological spectrum, can retrigger political mobilization, thereby influencing local electoral behaviour. To evaluate this hypothesis, we use a combined variety of electoral and violence dataset at the local level and analyse 40 years of electoral data in Italy (1946–1987), focusing on how the resurgence of political violence in the 1970s and 1980s affects the electoral legacies of historical violence preceding the democratic period (pre-1945). Our findings contribute to understanding the enduring and dynamic interplay between historical and contemporary political violence in shaping electoral behaviour in democracies, in particular shedding new light on (re-)activation mechanisms.","Keywords: Political Violence, Electoral Behaviour, Activation Mechanisms, Italy","Aldo Paparo","Stefano Costalli","University of Florence","Aldo Paparo","University of Florence","Andrea Ruggeri","University of Milan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Florence","University of Milan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0880_1665_0722.html","Mandatory Voter ID Reduces Turnout: Evidence from the UK Voter ID Reform","Mandatory voter identification (ID) requirements, which have historically been used to limit electoral participation, are becoming more common in developed democracies. In countries without a universal national ID, these laws create additional barriers to voting, potentially reducing electoral participation. Prior research on whether voter ID legislation affects turnout has yielded contradictory evidence, often lacks causal identification, and is predominantly centered on the US -- an exceptionally polarized context with a history of racialized voter suppression. To address these limitations, we investigate the recent introduction of mandatory voter ID in the UK, which does not share these exceptional features. Using evidence from this policy intervention, we conduct three analyses: (i) an evaluation of turnout changes at the local authority level before and after the reform, (ii) an analysis of individual-level self-reported turnout between voters with and without ID pre- and post-reform using panel data from the British Election Study (BES), and (iii) a causal estimation of the individual-level effect of ID ownership on turnout using an age-based discontinuity in photo driving license possession. Our analyses consistently show that the introduction of the voter ID law reduces electoral participation. These results highlight the suppressive effect of voter ID laws on turnout and the need for measures to mitigate this impact.","Keywords: voter ID, turnout, local elections","Jonathan Homola","Petra Schleiter","University of Oxford","Jonathan Homola","University of California, Los Angeles","Jeremy Siow","University of Oxford","Joelle Tasker","University of Essex","Margit Tavits","Washington University in St. Louis","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","University of California, Los Angeles","University of Essex","Washington University in St. Louis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Electoral Consequences of the 2021 State of Emergency on the Poland-Belarus Border","Are citizens willing to compromise their civil liberties in pursuit of salient policy objectives? We tackle this question in the context of the 2021 migration crisis on the Poland-Belarus border. To curb migrant flows, Poland introduced a state of emergency, infringing on citizens’ democratic freedoms. This registered report exploits the highly localized nature of these restrictions to investigate their electoral consequences, drawing on 2019 and 2023 parliamentary elections. Using a difference-in-discontinuities design, we do not find evidence that voters punished the incumbent Law and Justice (PiS) for restricting their civil liberties. While equivalence tests rule out a positive effect, anti-incumbent effects smaller than approximately 3-4 pp. cannot be completely dismissed. These results are consistent with the notion that voters may tolerate (though not reward) substantial infringements on civil liberties in return for decisive action on salient issues, providing one explanation for the growing use of strongman policies in democracies worldwide.","Keywords: Migration, State of Emergency, Democratic Freedoms, Poland, Belarus","Pawel Charasz","Pawel Charasz","The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","Anil Menon","University of California, Merced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","University of California, Merced",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper takes a supply-side perspective to examine to what extent parties in CEE are programmatically differentiated. Using the quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage of national parliamentary electoral campaigns from Hungary (1994-2022), Latvia (1993-2022), Poland (1997-2023), and Romania (1996-2020), the paper zooms in cross-national and over time perspectives. It examines the level of programmatic competition, issue salience and politicization at the party-system-level, and issue salience and entrepreneurship at the party-level.

"abstract_0883_1873_0854.html","Implications of ""Raised to Obey"" for the study of conflict and democracy","Nearly every country today has universal primary education. But why did governments in the West decide to provide education to all children in the first place? In Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education (Princeton University Press, 2024), Agustina Paglayan offers an unsettling answer. The introduction of broadly accessible primary education was not mainly a response to industrialization, or fueled by democratic ideals, or even aimed at eradicating illiteracy or improving skills. It was motivated instead by elites’ fear of the masses—and the desire to turn the “savage,” “unruly,” and “morally flawed” children of the lower classes into well-behaved future citizens who would obey the state and its laws.Drawing on unparalleled evidence from two centuries of education provision in Europe and the Americas, and deploying rich data that capture the expansion of primary education and its characteristics, this sweeping book offers a political history of primary schools that is both broad and deep. Paglayan shows that governments invested in primary schools when internal threats heightened political elites’ anxiety around mass violence and the breakdown of social order.Two hundred years later, the original objective of disciplining children remains at the core of how most public schools around the world operate. The future of education systems—and their ability to reduce poverty and inequality—hinges on our ability to understand and come to terms with this troubling history and with its implications for schooling, conflict, autocratic politics, democratic erosion, and how states consolidate their power.","Keywords: education, democracy, autocracy, state-building, conflict","Carl Henrik Knutsen","Carl Henrik Knutsen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, while earmarked funds serve donor priorities, they constrain IOs' flexibility and autonomy. This paper investigates under what circumstances donors relinquish or reduce earmarking. It posits that when donors possess alternative channels of influence over IOs, they are more inclined to donate without constraints. Analyzing a novel dataset on earmarked funding by OECD-DAC donors to international organizations alongside original data on staffing in United Nations agencies, this study examines the relationship between donor staffing within IOs and the stringency of earmarking. By scrutinizing the staffing mechanism's impact on earmarking decisions, this paper demonstrates that increased national representation within IO staff correlates with decreased earmarking stringency. Surprisingly, this effect extends beyond policy staff to non-policy roles. These findings suggest a nuanced trade-off between donor influence avenues, informing debates on optimizing donor control over IOs.","Keywords: united nations, international organizations, financing, earmarking","Svanhildur Thorvaldsdottir","Svanhildur Thorvaldsdottir",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Iceland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although research on international relations and negotiations has examined different negotiation strategies and bargaining dynamics extensively, we know less about how factors such as negotiator gender and age may shape negotiation dynamics. We theorize that because individuals face different expectations and assessments about their competence due to their identity characteristics, they also have incentives to adjust their rhetoric and strategies to demonstrate their capabilities as negotiators. This ``competence signaling"" can lead individuals from underrepresented groups to adopt less cooperative strategies. Leveraging novel data on the identities of negotiators in more than 3,500 statements at the Council of the EU in 2011-2016, we investigate whether different kinds of individuals employ systematically different strategies when negotiating EU policy. Our findings show that women are less likely to indicate flexibility and willingness to compromise in negotiations than men, as well as less likely to be informal in their negotiation rhetoric.

We argue that this gendered divergence arises from an overlooked household model of politics, where voters account for family members’ economic risks with significant gender heterogeneity in policy responses. Using U.S. General Social Survey data (1996–2014), we construct a novel measure of family exposure to economic shocks by integrating respondents' and their family members’ (spouses, fathers, and mothers) trade exposure from the NAFTA trade shock. This measure reveals substantial within-household variation in labor market risk, and drives significant policy differences by gender: men turn toward protectionism, especially migration barriers, while women prioritize family-focused welfare policies, notably childcare. Direct trade exposure through respondents’ own jobs narrowly increases support for protectionism while family exposure significantly amplifies support for both welfare and protectionist policies. Critically, these household effects shape electoral outcomes, bolstering support for anti-globalization populists and diverting demand away from left candidates. Our findings highlight the necessity of moving beyond individual voter characteristics to fully understand political behavior in the face of globalization-induced economic risks.","Keywords: Trade and immigration preferences, populist voting, gender, households","Thomas Flaherty","Soohyun Cho","Texas A&M University","Thomas Flaherty","Bowdoin College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Texas A&M University","Bowdoin College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Heterogeneous Sources and Processes of Implementation in Municipalities: Evidence from the Spanish Transparency Law.","A growing number of FOI laws have been passed worldwide, but their full enactment remains a challenge. Despite significant advances, the antecedents, conditions and dynamics driving transparency institutionalization remain largely unknown. This article aims to fill an important gap in the literature by empirically examining the unfolding of institutionalization processes in Spanish municipalities under the 2013 Spanish Transparency Law. This law imposes new legal requirements but does not mandate formal structural changes, offering a compelling case to observe organic municipal responses to legal mandates. Using a sequential mixed method strategy, we first surveyed the compliance across 1,031 municipalities. In a second step, we administered a questionnaire to transparency officers to explore their implementation strategies. Finally, we conducted 51 interviews with technicians in-charge of transparency and 14 with provincial entities that provide municipal assistance. Our contributions are twofold: first, we identify the sources of transparency implementation and analyze how institutionalization unfolds over time, highlighting the factors and conditions that increase the likelihood of success, paving new avenues for further empirical research.

"abstract_0889_2048_1176.html","Elite Incivility as a Heuristic: How Tone of Debate Shapes Voters’ Perceptions of Politics","Voters often rely on cognitive shortcuts to identify political actors and assess politics. Policy issues and positions act as key cues, as they are linked to specific political parties via issue ownership theories. However, beyond substantive positions, another cue is hitherto less explored: the tone of the debate and whether political actors communicate respectfully with political opponents or resort to personal and/or delegitimizing attacks (i.e., elite incivility). This study examines whether and how (un-) civil elite rhetoric serves as an additional heuristic for voters’ perceptions of politics. Using a survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,879), respondents are exposed to fictitious politicians arguing about a policy issue with varying levels of elite incivility. Respondents indicate (1) which party, if any, they associate with each politician, and (2) how they perceive differences in the stated policy positions. Preliminary results show that respondents deduce additional information from the level of elite incivility, complementing what they derive from policy issues: First, compared to civil discourse, high levels of elite incivility increase the likelihood that respondents associate politicians with specific parties. The respective party attributions reflect common expectations about parties’ rhetorical behavior. Second, substantively identical policy positions are perceived as more polarized when the discourse is uncivil. This suggests that elite incivility could signal further distance to political opponents. These findings highlight the role of elite rhetoric in shaping citizens’ perception of politics and issue polarization in an age of increasing incivility.","Keywords: elite incivility, elite rhetoric, cognitive shortcuts, voter perceptions, survey experiment","Jasmin Rath","Jasmin Rath",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Cologne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These political elites are best situated to organize and implement a response to help communities recover and rebuild after a response, but they are also uniquely positioned to hold important press conferences. Mass tragedies historically cause a rally ’round the flag effect that boosts approval of such executives, but an increasingly polarized political environment may be reshaping such effects. Further, constraints imposed on executives by party activists may cause executives to use such events as opportunities to make electoral rather than policy gains by polarizing and blaming. Using original survey experiments, I find that while symbolic and unifying rhetorical strategies do not depolarize the electorate, they are the expected norm with voters of a governor’s ownand opposing parties prepared to punish a governor for using a mass tragedy to polarize and shift blame. Further, effects differ for natural disasters versus terrorist events/mass shootings with citizens punishing less after the latter. This has important implications for understanding how executives should best respond for their own electoral best interests in a highly polarized environment with constraints pressuring them to polarize.","Keywords: polarization; political psychology; trauma; policy framing; survey experiment","Wayde Marsh","Wayde Marsh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Tennessee",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0891_1907_1252.html","Individual Campaign Contributions: The Informational Channel","This paper analyzes the relationship between the amount of political information and the flow of individual campaign contributions in the United States. Intuitively, individual citizens are more likely to give money to campaigns if they possess enough information about the political process, or at least about the potential recipients of donations. In this sense, the availability of different options in the media diet of citizens could affect the pattern of contributions, as it would shape the spectrum of information they can rely on. This paper studies this neglected source of variation for campaign contributions, called the informational channel. In theory, substantial volume of political news from the media has the potential to create an informed group of relatively small donors that could balance the influence of interest groups and large contributors.First, I show that the media coverage of members of Congress from local press influences the share of in-district donations they received from individuals. Then, I collect evidence from other media channel, such as cable TV and high-speed internet, all pointing in the same direction of a causal effect of political knowledge on individual donations. Finally, I tentatively define the scope conditions for a change in the media landscape to have an impact on individual donations, as well as attempting to distinguish between the potential effect of “ideological” (e.g., cable TV) and “neutral” (e.g., local press) media channels.","Keywords: campaign finance; media; individual donors; political information","Alberto Parmigiani","Alberto Parmigiani",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"LSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A growing body of literature on the so-called incumbent advantage studies politicians' careers by examining how leveraging the privileges associated with a politician’s position increases the likelihood of future electoral success. However, this empirical work falls short in isolating the role of status, given that incumbency also provides access to additional resources and networks. We address this gap by introducing a new concept, ""status advantage,"" which arises from disparities in the esteem hierarchies experienced by politicians within their party following their election to parliament. Using data from the Greek electoral system and employing a Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design, we compare the reelection prospects of MPs who received bonus seats with those of ""regular"" MPs. Our findings suggest that MPs elected as regulars have a significantly higher probability of running in the next election and being reelected, compared to those elected as bonuses, indicating the influence of within-party status on electoral outcomes. Further analysis using parliamentary speeches throughout our period of study helps to unpack whether this effect is driven by a party mechanism, where the party is more likely to promote regular MPs, or an individual mechanism, where MPs internalize their status. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the importance of status in shaping political careers and thereby affecting democratic accountability.","Keywords: status, incumbent advantage, accountability","Ioannis Mastrominas","Elias Dinas","European University Institute"," Ioannis Mastrominas","European University Institute","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using Callaway and Sant’Anna's (2021) staggered treatment difference-in-differences methodology, we first capture how the emergence of environmental protests impacts rhetorical signaling in parliamentary settings. We then instrument these predicted values to capture their effect on the actual implementation of environmental policy and apply gradient descent optimization to identify the words, tones, and linguistic features from parliamentary speeches most strongly associated with government responsiveness to environmental protests. This research design allows for rigorous examination of legislative response across these nine democratic states, and we construct a comprehensive framework for understanding how environmental movements influence political decision-making. This analysis promises to provide empirical insights into the mechanisms of democratic responsiveness to environmental challenges, bridging existing gaps in understanding between public mobilization and legislative action.","Keywords: Participatory Politics, Government Response, Methods, Environmental Politics","Elisa D'Amico, Katelyn Nutley, Aarushi Sharma","Elisa D'Amico","University of St Andrews"," Katelyn Nutley","University of St Andrews"," Aarushi Sharma","University of St Andrews","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of St Andrews",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This means when status-quo conditions in their conflict with the state change, domestic terrorist groups can react to the resulting new opportunities and risks. In this paper, we theorize that when a country’s economic conditions change, specifically the emergence or worsening of economic turmoil, domestic terrorist groups must make a strategic decision to decrease their domestic attacks (strategic conflict avoidance) to avoid opportunistic counterterrorism (CT), increase their domestic attacks (strategic conflict seeking) to leverage the government’s weakness and add to it’s struggles, or shift their violence from domestic to international attacks (strategic conflict transference) to continue demonstrating threat and capability while limiting opportunistic CT. The latter choice does risk an international CT response or international support for the domestic government that could be leveraged to buy support in the face of turmoil.

"abstract_0899_2365_0309.html","A False Promise for the Left Behind? The Uneven Impact of Place-Based Policies on Political Discontent","Recent election results have demonstrated that political discontent in many countries is regionally concentrated. Research analyzing these electoral outcomes has identified a “geography of discontent” in which populist voting clusters in economically left-behind places. To counter regionally concentrated political frustration, place-based economic policies targeting disadvantaged regions have become increasingly popular among policymakers.In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of place-based policies in countering political frustration and populism with a focus on their distributional effects within regions. Building on political economy research on place-based spending, we hypothesize that such policies are unlikely to benefit the most disadvantaged citizens within targeted regions. Instead, we expect place-based funding to be skill-biased, benefitting primarily well-educated voters with lower levels of political discontent.Empirically, we study the EU’s Cohesion Policy using a natural experiment and randomized survey experiments. For the natural experiment, we construct a new large panel dataset at the subnational level from Eurobarometer waves in 1980-2020 and leverage a discontinuity in regional funding eligibility in an RD design. In the randomized experiments that are embedded in a two-wave survey (N=2,046), we expose respondents to information treatments and encourage one half of them to pay attention to EU-funded projects in their home region between the two waves. In both analyses, we find strong evidence that place-based policies reduce political discontent only among the highly skilled and the rich. Political attitudes of other groups are not affected, suggesting that the effectiveness of place-based policies in addressing political discontent is limited by their distributional effects.","Keywords: Regional inequality, Place-based policies, populism, European Union (EU)","Johannes Lattmann","Valentin Lang","University of Mannheim"," Johannes Lattmann","University of Mannheim","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0900_2677_1528.html","Regime Loyalty During Wartime – Evidence from Nazi Germany under World War II","Maintaining popular support is crucial for dictatorships to sustain power during wartime. The loss of such support can threaten regime survival by fostering domestic resistance, reducing combat motivation, and creating fractures within the elite coalition. What factors shape regime loyalty in autocracies under the pressures of war? Investigating this question presents significant challenges. In dictatorships, reliable data on political attitudes is scarce, particularly regarding sensitive topics like regime loyalty. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging unique data from a historical case: Nazi Germany during World War II. We measure regime loyalty by analyzing wartime obituaries in local newspapers. Historical research has established that obituaries for fallen soldiers constituted one of the few channels of public expression that have long remained relatively free of heavy regime censorship. Some obituaries openly displayed support for the war and loyalty to the regime by invoking Adolf Hitler and celebrating heroism for the Fatherland. In contrast, others avoided such nationalist rhetoric, highlighted the tragedy of death, and departed from the regime’s glorification of the war. We classify and extract precise wordings and references within these obituaries from a corpus of about 1.8 million historical and digitized newspaper pages from North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most densely populated region. We geocode locations of funerals and combine these data with city-level measures of citizens' exposure to bombings, losses of community members, and food scarcity. We implement difference-in-difference analyses to investigate how these war experiences have shaped citizens’ attitudes toward the regime.","Keywords: Autocratic politics, war, regime loyalty, machine learning, historical political economy","Sascha Riaz","Felix Haass","Humboldt University","Alexander De Juan","Osnabrueck University","Sascha Riaz","EUI","Julian Voss","Osnabrueck University","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt University","Osnabrueck University","EUI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0901_0522_0646.html","We are (not) the people! Exploring the dynamic interplay of populist attitudes between Immigrants and the Majority Population","Building on the rise of populist parties, recent scholarly attention has focused on populist attitudes, thereby understanding their manifestations, identifying their determinants and correlates, and assessing their impact, e.g., on voting. However, a significant gap remains in the literature regarding specific demographic groups – a particular focus on immigrant-origin individuals is lacking. Including immigrants in these analyses is essential given their distinct migration histories, diverse political orientations, and socialisation in different political regimes. To address this gap, we compare populist attitudes between individuals with and without a migration background, arguing first that immigrants have stronger populist attitudes, especially among later generations. Second, we suggest that a background in less democratic political regimes leads to stronger populist attitudes, while the influence of these attitudes on voting for populist parties applies similarly across both groups. Using data from the first wave of the DeZIM.panel, we operationalise populist attitudes according to the Goertz approach. Our results indicate, first, that immigrants exhibit stronger populist attitudes, yet there is an alignment with increasing generation. Second, socialisation in a more authoritarian regime is positively associated with populist attitudes. Finally, the effect of populist attitudes on the propensity to vote for the radical right-wing populist AfD does not differ between immigrants and the majority population.","Keywords: Populism, Populist Attitudes, Voting Behavior, Immigrants","Philipp Hoffmann","Philipp Hoffmann","University of Bamberg","Joscha Bäuerle","GESIS – Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Mannheim","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bamberg","GESIS – Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using original local-level data and a spatial regression discontinuity design, we establish that religious repression was most severe in the annexed Warthegau region, resulting in the arrest or death of most local priests. We argue that targeting the clergy can have divergent effects on religious participation and attachments to identities the clergy represent. The interruption in the supply of religious services caused by repression may undermine the behavioral norm of regular church attendance. At the same time, by elevating the victims to the status of martyrs for their faith and nation, this form of repression may bolster religious nationalism among their followers. Consistent with the supply channel, church attendance and religious schooling were lower in repressed localities. In line with the martyrdom channel, these areas built more monuments to victimized priests and showed more support for nationalist parties when WWII was politically salient. Our results suggest that foreign repression against religious leaders leaves lasting legacies for political and social behavior.","Keywords: repression, religion, nationalism, right-wing vote, legacies","Volha Charnysh","Volha Charnysh","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Ricardo Pique","Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0903_0794_0725.html","A decade of get-out-the-vote experiments: Positive downstream impacts of inducing young people to vote as a habit","When electoral turnout rates are low in general or unequal across social groups, it is harmful to descriptive representation and to the legitimacy of democratic government. Get-out-the-vote campaigns can increase turnout and target marginal voter groups to reduce participatory inequality. Crucially, inducing voting at one election contributes to the creation of a voting habit, which can yield persistent positive downstream effects. In this paper, we study the effects of two large-scale field experiments conducted on young Danish voters at the 2013 local election and 2014 European election on turnout in eight downstream elections between 2014 and 2024. Turnout is measured for virtually the entire population of potential voters with individual-level administrative turnout records. We find that the two campaigns increased turnout in the original upstream election. When we instrument turnout in the upstream election with randomly assigned treatment status, we find that the creation of a voting habit has persistent downstream turnout effects, particularly in elections of the same type as the upstream election (local or European) and in high-salience national elections. Finally, we show that the encouragement to turn out is particularly effective for low-propensity voters, which means that effective get-out-the-vote campaigns can foster more equal electoral participation years later.","Keywords: behavior, comparative politics, representation, voting","Søren Damsbo-Svendsen","Søren Damsbo-Svendsen","Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen"," Kasper Møller Hansen","Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis digs deeper than the standard “remain or leave” question concerning the EU, trying to get a more nuanced picture of how Hungarians perceive the policy balance of EU membership and their country’s place within the EU, two decades after EU accession. We present what the EU means to Hungarians, what they consider to be the main advantages and disadvantages of EU membership, and how they assess the economic balance of EU membership. This paper focuses especially on the question of how much Europe Hungarians actually want: How strong is domestic support for deeper integration on the one hand, and how strong is the support for a policy of national sovereignty on the other? With these questions in mind, we examine the public policy areas in which Hungarians would like to see the EU as the competent decision-making level, and the issues that they would prefer to remain exclusively within national competence. Building on this, we use a typology based on support for EU membership and national/EU competences to classify domestic attitudes towards the role of the EU. By examining the interplay between public opinion and policy decisions, this paper offers valuable insights into the broader implications of Euroscepticism in Hungary.","Keywords: Euroscepticism, Hungary, European Union, Europeanisation, public opinion","András Bíró-Nagy","András Bíró-Nagy",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0905_2361_0823.html","A Make-or-Break Opportunity? New Party Survival after Breakthrough in Multilevel Electoral Systems","Winning a parliamentary seat for the first time marks a crucial milestone for any new party. However, many such parties fade away quickly, and only a few can survive and retain their seats at re-election. Why do some new parties survive their first re-election, while others fail? The emergence of multilevel electoral systems has fundamentally reshaped the European party landscape. These systems, with their multiple access points, create new strategic opportunities and challenges for emerging parties. I argue that how new party strategically navigate electoral competition following its initial breakthrough shapes their fortunes at re-election —specifically, its short-term survival. A new party’s decision to contest elections at a different level between its initial success and the subsequent election at the original level –a timeframe termed here as the opportunity window— presents both opportunities and risks to its short-term survival. Engaging in elections at a different level during this opportunity window can enhance a new party’s prospects for re-election if successful. Conversely, failure in these elections can diminish those prospects compared to abstaining altogether. Empirical analysis using a novel dataset that records 210 new party trajectories during the opportunity window in 13 European countries between 2004 and 2023 supports the arguments.","Keywords: New parties, multilevel systems, new party survival, re-election, opportunity structure","Thareerat Laohabut","Thareerat Laohabut",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"LMU Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some scholars argue that this demonstrates the spread of international human rights norms, which in turn will bring about improvements in human rights. However, others have questioned this view, pointing to the use of human rights rhetoric by states that commit rights abuses and the willingness of repressive states to ratify international human rights treaties. These scholars argue that human rights commitments are examples of ‘cheap talk’.In this study, we examine this issue using new empirical evidence that helps to address limitations of existing approaches. Using natural language processing (NLP) methods, we examine countries’ engagement with human rights in their annual statements in the General Debate of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). We do this using the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), which we extend back to 1946, and examining factors associated with greater state engagement with human rights in their UNGD statements. Our analysis demonstrates a strong the relationship between human rights rhetoric and states’ human rights performance, and sheds light on the different human rights rhetoric across states.Therefore, the paper makes several contributions. First, it identifies trends in states’ human rhetoric references over a 75-year period. Second demonstrates the relationship between human rights rhetoric and state behaviour. Third, we unpack differences in human rights rhetoric between more rights-protecting states and human rights violators. In doing so, the paper provides important new empirical evidence to address a fundamental issue in the global politics of human rights.","Keywords: Human rights; repression; foreign policy; United Nations; computational text analysis;","Niheer Dasandi","Niheer Dasandi","University of Birmingham","Olga Gasparyan","Florida State University","Slava Jankin","University of Birmingham","Neil Mitchell","University College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Birmingham","Florida State University","University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0908_2218_1119.html","From experience to voting? Understanding the role of actual and perceived environmental conditions in local policy support","How much do actual or perceived societal problems shape the policy preferences of citizens? Citizens’ support for state regulation is not shaped in a vacuum but within the environments in which individuals are embedded. Yet, it is unclear to what extent policy preferences are a reaction to the actual or only to the perceived conditions individuals experience and under which circumstances external conditions shape the demand for political action at all.A particularly salient case is the link between environment-related conditions and policy support. Although an increasing share of the world’s population is exposed to environmental degradation, support for policy regulations in this area seems to stagnate or polarize. This paper focuses on long-term exposure to air pollution, noise levels, and green space availability, and tests to what extent the actual or the perceived exposure to these environmental conditions translates into support for local environmental policies.Leveraging geo-data and survey experiments fielded among a country-representative Swiss sample (N=5000), we disentangle the complex link between actual and perceived environmental conditions and support for environmental policies. Our findings suggest that individuals do not uniformly perceive environmental conditions of the same magnitude as equally burdensome and that cognitive processing of the exposure primarily shapes their policy support.Since there is a discrepancy between actual and perceived exposure, this implies that worsening environmental conditions alone will not ensure greater acceptance of local environmental policy implementation. Instead, perceived experiences of long-term environmental stressors and resources hold the key to securing majority support for these policies.","Keywords: air pollution, noise, green spaces, perceived exposure, environmental policy support","Sarah Gomm","Sarah Gomm",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I argue that, like in any other electoral system, incumbents in preferential PR elections are political entrepreneurs: They use their political status to obtain an electoral advantage. But, in multi-member systems, this advantage may reflect strategies that intend to expand political support to other areas in the district. Using data from legislative elections in Brazil at the level of poll ing stations, I identify candidates' geographical hotspots---electoral bases---and test whether incumbents are more successful in maintaining and expanding political support across consecutive contests. Exploiting the fact that preferential PR systems allocate seats differentially to candidates with identical performances, I show that incumbents enjoy an overall advantage and expand electoral bases without losing support in old hotspots. Further, I show that incumbents can use their political status to influence party decisions, channeling resources to their campaigns and avoiding competition from co-partisans. These findings indicate that the literature often underestimates incumbency advantage in preferential PR elections.","Keywords: Incumbency Advantage; Proportional Representation; Preference Votes; Causal Identification; Spatial Analyses","Thiago MQ Moreira","Thiago MQ Moreira",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Louisiana State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The methodology includes rigorous validation tests and an application of this multilingual approach to examine the impact of rhetoric on party choice.

While prevailing theories suggest that clean elections and accountability drive development, alternative perspectives propose that clientelistic networks can also serve as governance channels. In this paper, we address this question causally by analyzing data from an original RCT conducted during Colombia’s 2019 local mayoral elections, designed to promote electoral integrity. Leveraging the intervention’s effect on increasing the likelihood of electing cleaner candidates as a “first stage,” we assess the impact of electoral integrity on municipal development. Our findings indicate that, four years after the intervention, municipalities with better electoral integrity exhibit higher rates of citizen access to public goods and services. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, we show that mayors elected in intervention areas do not differ significantly in public sector experience, incumbency, or sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that selection effects are unlikely to explain the observed differences. We also find no increase in demand for public goods in these municipalities, implying that the observed effects arise from the supply side. Additionally, mayors in intervention areas are less likely to be investigated or sanctioned by Colombian oversight agencies, suggesting reduced rent-seeking behavior among these officials. Lastly, we document that citizen monitoring of elections remains high in municipalities affected by the intervention, even four years post-intervention. Together, our findings provide the first causal evidence that improved electoral integrity strengthens accountability mechanisms in the medium term, prompting mayors to deliver more effectively on public goods and services.","Keywords: public services, Colombia, RCT, electoral integrity","Natalia Garbiras-Diaz","Natalia Garbiras-Diaz","Harvard Business School","Mateo Montenegro","Toulouse School of Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Harvard Business School","Toulouse School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results show that once organized crime is removed from local governments, bureaucratic performance goes up: payment delays go down and bureaucrats are more present at work.

Effects appear to be driven not by the easing of the budget constraint by the cash transfer but by the leadership opportunities that the program created among beneficiary households.

Does contingency, the defining characteristic of clientelism, matter? We utilize survey vignettes to test Indonesian voter reactions to three political strategies for service delivery: the impartial monitoring of the bureaucracy, personal intervention to help individuals access services, and clientelistic personal intervention that only assists supporters. We find that impartially working to monitor the civil service increases vote likelihood substantially more than other strategies, while clientelistically assisting supporters generates no further electoral costs compared to non-clientelist personal intervention. We argue that social embeddedness crucially shapes which groups drive the average effect by changing the perceived value of personal exchange. Only those who report high social density in their communities (high horizontal embeddedness) or those who do not approach politicians or bureaucrats for help (low vertical embeddedness) find impartial monitoring more appealing, and these groups constitute a majority. Finally, we establish that service delivery clientelism is seen as distinct from vote buying, which has important implications for clientelism research. The results challenge many accounts, including the beliefs of politicians, on the transactional character of Indonesian politics, and provides new evidence for the centrality of social relationships in shaping the perceived value of clientelism.","Keywords: governance, clientelism, vote buying, accountability, social embeddedness","Harry Dienes","Harry Dienes","Cornell University","Hui Yuan Neo","Cornell University","Eitan Paul","JPAL","Burhanuddin Muhtadi","Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University","JPAL","Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent instances of this include Roe v. Wade protests in France, BLM protests in Hong Kong, and Anti-Ukraine Invasion protests in Chile. What are broader patterns that underlie this form of political action, that may be consistent or varying across different contexts? Why might 'everyday' people protest on behalf of populations abroad, where the concessions/benefits of such protests may not be directly felt at home? This paper introduces a dataset-in-progress that tracks instances where populations have explicitly protested on behalf of other populations abroad between 2010-2020 (by country-event-year), and presents some preliminary findings. Key dataset variables include the issue being protested on and its ‘home’ country, whether citizens or governments of the ‘home country’ respond to the protests, repression abroad, the time lag (in days) for a protest to occur in response to the issue abroad, regime and issue-types, and alliances/shared IO memberships on the country-level.

I argue that both identity hardening and adaptive integration strategies often coexist within the same family unit, reflecting a process of ""strategic hedging"" of identity. Crucial factors include the timing since the repression, its intensity, and its duration: families with more ancestral repression tend to cultivate durable minority identities inside the home while simultaneously adopting integration strategies in public state spheres. This causal claim is supported by a quasi-experimental design leveraging Albania’s communist period (1945–1990), when closed borders eliminated migration as an option and a policy repressed some Greek villages but supported others. The analysis of mechanisms includes naming strategies--especially of females during intense repression--and contextual factors such as the occupation of the household head. The findings highlight the value of studying smaller, understudied contexts like Albania and demonstrate the importance panel data in revealing nuanced dynamics in identity repression and transmission decisions.","Keywords: assimilation, post-communism, migration, ethnic engineering, backlash","Mary Shiraef","Mary Shiraef",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"MZES University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For decades, scholars have been exploring the causal link between economic grievances and protest, but the evidence is mixed.

I propound that there are two types of economic hardship individuals experience: national and individual. I argue that national economic hardship (a nation’s poor macroeconomic performance) generates political grievances among individuals, which, in turn, triggers anger, and increased anger spurs protest. Moreover, I contend that personal economic hardship (an individual’s financial struggles that are not attributed to a nation’s economic performance) evokes self-blame, which, in turn, decreases mobilization.

In this paper, we address the question of what accounts for resistance to authoritarian reforms aimed at bringing the behavior of judges in line with the regime's preferences. We present two sets of hypotheses: first, that resistance at the regional level is affected by the strength of local political opposition; and second, that resistance at the level of individual judges is facilitated by what we call 'embeddedness' in the local political environment, or personal and professional connections to local, rather than central, political actors. Measuring judicial compliance as decisions in favor of state-owned corporations or state entities, we test these hypotheses using a dataset containing the universe of decisions  -- over 20 million individual cases -- made by regional commercial (arbitrazh) courts in the Russian Federation from 2008 to 2024. We focus on the case of a 2014 reform that abolished the higher commercial court, which we expect to have brought judges' behavior more in line with the state's preferences by overturning older precedents and centralizing legal decision-making. Due to the high volume of cases and arbitrary timing, we use a regression discontinuity in time framework to determine the causal effect of the reform and the sources of local heterogeneity.","Keywords: Russian politics, authoritarian politics, authoritarian institutions, commercial law","Perry Carter","Perry Carter","New York University Abu Dhabi","Leonid Peisakhin","New York University Abu Dhabi","Yuliya Velichinskaya","New York University Abu Dhabi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York University Abu Dhabi","New York University Abu Dhabi","New York University Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that electoral incentives create perverse pressures for corruption, leading incumbents to favor politically connected firms in awarding public procurement contracts in exchange for kickbacks. This favoritism intensifies in the run-up to elections, when both the demand for campaign funds and public scrutiny peak. Politicians strategically allocate contracts for harder-to-monitor projects, thereby evading public and media oversight. Using data from the Philippines (2004–2019) and a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, we demonstrate that politically connected firms are disproportionately favored for difficult-to-monitor contracts, such as infrastructure projects. Detailed audit data further reveal that projects awarded to these firms are of lower quality. In contrast, these firms are less likely to secure contracts for high-scrutiny projects, such as schools and health facilities.

"abstract_0922_0853_0585.html","Reducing Post-Disaster Conflict Risk through Labor and Diaspora Networks","How do pre-existing patterns of labor migration influence the relationship between natural disasters and intrastate conflicts? Natural disasters disrupt communities and everyday government activities. While governments can respond with post-disaster aid and reconstruction, even temporary disruption and displacement can spark social conflict and dissatisfaction. We argue that existing migration patterns can improve community resilience and recovery and make conflict less likely because disaster victims can rely on other sources for support. Labor migrants often maintain connections to communities of origin and send remittances to relatives who remain at home. These remittances can be a major source of income and can be a particularly important part of resilience when there are severe economic or climate shocks. Natural disasters are location specific; they are unlikely to affect the whole diaspora network at the same time. We expect that existing migration stocks and flows, established remittance systems, and diaspora ties mitigate adverse effects of displacement by reducing post-disaster grievances and lowering the likelihood of new conflicts arising after natural disasters. We test our theory in a global cross-sectional time series dataset by compiling information about natural disasters, labor migration, remittances, and intrastate conflict. We also use case vignettes from East Asia to illustrate the causal mechanisms in our theory. We find that disasters are less likely to lead to conflict in countries with strong diaspora networks and regular remittance flows. Our findings demonstrate the importance of migration patterns and policies for disaster response and recovery and for violent conflict.","Keywords: disaster; remittance; conflict; civil war; resilience","Elise Pizzi","Elise Pizzi","University of Iowa"," Sara Mitchell","University of Iowa"," Tianhui Wu","University of Iowa","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Iowa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We provide novel evidence on the long-term impact of the Great Recession on U.S. electoral outcomes. We use a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging geographic variation in unemployment shocks. We find that counties more severely affected by the recession experienced a sustained increase in Democratic vote shares, particularly in Congressional elections, with effects persisting through 2022. Investigating potential mechanisms, we find that these electoral shifts are unlikely to be driven by (i) lasting negative economic repercussions, (ii) compositional changes in the affected regions, (iii) supply-side changes in candidate ideology, or (iv) compensatory government spending. Instead, survey evidence on individual attitudes suggests that the Great Recession significantly and persistently lowered expectations for future quality of life, potentially increasing demands for redistribution and benefiting Democrats. Contrary to prior work, our findings imply that (i) adverse economic shocks do not necessarily benefit right-wing populist candidates and (ii) recessions can have lasting political consequences even after their direct economic effects have subsided.","Keywords: Economic voting, Political realignment, Regional inequality, Electoral behavior","Hanno Hilbig","Hanno Hilbig","University of California, Davis","Vincent Heddesheimer","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Davis","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

European competitiveness in a long-term perspective","“Competitiveness” is high on the agenda of European policymakers and academics alike. In early September 2024, Mario Draghi presented a much-anticipated report in which he warned about the economic shortcomings of the European Union in managing the green and digital transformations, especially when compared to other global trading blocs like the United States and China. Moreover, EU institutions and national governments are discussing a revival of industrial policy and more activist forms of state intervention.This paper examines European Council and European Commission communication on competitiveness from a long-term perspective (1960 to 2024). It applies supervised transformer models for content classification in a newly collected and merged dataset including all European Council and Summit conclusions, all Commission speeches and related legislative acts. The classified textual data are qualitatively analyzed to compare the communication and strategic priorities of competitiveness challenges since the 1960s.The analysis shows that questions about economic competitiveness have regularly been the subject of European Council deliberations and Commission speeches. In addition, the paper documents interesting variation, both in terms of content and strategy: while competition for a long time concerned relations with supposedly like-minded actors like the US or Japan, more recently the focus shifted towards geopolitics and the role of China. The European Council increasingly considers greater economic autonomy and investments in European public goods as adequate tools in the global competitiveness race.","Keywords: competitiveness; European Commission; European Council; European integration; industrial policy","Lucas Schramm","Leonce Röth","Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich"," Lucas Schramm","Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0925_0544_0827.html","A Divided Family: Explaining the varied impact of the radical right on gender and family policy","Many voices warn that the growing power of the radical right risks jeopardizing hard-won gender equality gains. Yet, social rights have often outlasted their original architects, being upheld or even expanded under hostile administrations. In family policy, some radical right parties in Scandinavia have legislated to promote sharing work and care responsibilities across genders. What explains the varying impact of radical right parties on family policy? Why do they accept established rights in some cases but not others?This paper focuses on feedback effects to explain the varying impact of radical right government participation. I argue that progressive social rights, once implemented, can generate social and institutional inertia, creating spillover effects that influence future partisan governments. Family policies can embed themselves in work-family arrangements, societal aspirations, and employer practices, fostering broad-based social and elite support. This dynamic has led radical right parties in Scandinavia to adopt more progressive stances, aligning with shifting voter preferences and economic demands. In contrast, weak policy foundations in other contexts, along with policies lacking strong or large support constituencies, have enabled these parties to implement radical conservative agendas.This paper tests this theory through a systematic qualitative comparison of the radical right’s impact on family policy in European governments. It identifies key turning points where these parties adopted more progressive positions, offering insights into the conditions shaping their policy transformations. This article provides an empirical contribution to understanding the radical right in government, with broader relevance for research on policy shifts in party agendas","Keywords: Radical right, gender equality, feedback effects, party change, party effects.","Manuel Alvariño","Manuel Alvariño",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How can we study this tension, and why might TPIs favor either technocratic or democratic legitimation? This paper examines these questions through a case study of the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) portfolio expansion. Expanding on earlier frameworks of legitimation strategies among TPIs, this study investigates whether regulating societal issue areas influences ISO’s legitimation strategies. Drawing on a novel dataset, the findings reveal that in contrast to the traditional physical standards, ISO uses democratic legitimation strategies for societal standards in both the input and output phases of the process.

In this paper, we argue that A potential yet overlooked explanation that voters may judge the misuse of public money differently depending on the type of policy project impacted by the misuse and the gender of the offender. Voters’ willingness to punish corruption will be influenced by whether the corrupt politician misused public funds in a policy sector that is coded in line with the politician’s gender—that is, whether a woman (man) committed corruption in a feminine-coded (masculine-coded) policy area. Furthermore, we argue that effects will differ by respondent gender, specifically we expect that female respondents will react particularly strongly to misconduct by female politicians in female coded policy areas. We test these expectations with a conjoint experiment in Mexico that tasks respondents with evaluating hypothetical mayors who embezzled money from different policy sectors. We leverage two female coded policy areas (healthcare and welfare) and two traditionally male coded policy areas (crime and infrastructure. Our findings speak to the role gender stereotypes play in punishing corruption, and provide evidence that the policy area in which corruption occurs can change voters’ willingness to electorally punish malfeasant mayors.","Keywords: corruption, gender, accountability","Jana Schwenk","Emily Elia","Gothenburg University"," Jana Schwenk","Gothenburg University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Gothenburg University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fiscal capacity is commonly explained as the outcome of war or democratization. But in many episodes of state-building both these factors were absent. In order to study the politics of authoritarian state-building, we examine the case of Chile, arguably the most significant example of fiscal modernization in Latin America, utilizing a unique data set comprising financial and personnel information from the Chilean Ministry of Finance, administrative and fiscal reforms in the Ministries of Finance and Internal Affairs, in addition to details of the backgrounds of government ministers.

However, the potential impact of political violence on individuals depends on politicized media debates and the reactions of social and political actors to political violence. To gain a better understanding of different responses to political violence and polarisation dynamics in public debates, we study media reactions by political parties following fatal acts of political violence. We compare public debates in the context of central security threats in Europe in recent decades: ETA in Spain (1975-2010) and right-wing and Islamist terrorism in Germany (2000-2020). Within this framework, we investigate agenda-setting effects across parties, polarising issues and frames, and the visibility and resonance of such events. We focus on larger periods before and shortly after an event. Using two mainstream Spanish newspapers and four German newspapers, we draw on quantitative text analysis methods such as topic models to infer which issues are mediatized in combination with specific parties. We implement RDD methods to infer reactions in the partisan mediatized communication caused by political violence.

"abstract_0930_0328_1190.html","From Abroad to Home: How Politicians Use Global Benchmarks in Domestic Policy Debates","In an increasingly interconnected world, countries often face similar challenges, from economic instability to public health crises to climate change. When finding solutions to pressing problems, politicians often seek inspiration from other countries, potentially leading to the diffusion of policies through learning and emulation. Throughout this process, politicians regularly convey lessons learned from other countries to their own citizens, essentially referencing global benchmarks to highlight where their country stands in comparison to others and set ambitious goals based on what is being achieved elsewhere. However, the systematic identification of these benchmarking cues has been largely overlooked in the policy diffusion literature. This paper addresses that gap by examining parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Australia, and Singapore between 2001 and 2018. Using large language models (LLMs) to identify and classify these cues, we provide new insights into how policies from abroad are presented to the public at home. Our analysis disaggregates the applied benchmarking cues and highlights three key categories - success, competition, and norm compliance - employed in political debates. Additionally, we analyze which countries are benchmarked over time and across various policy areas, as well as the individual-level factors associated with the use of benchmarking cues. In particular, we argue that politicians with elite educational backgrounds or prior experience studying abroad are more likely to benchmark foreign countries. Male politicians tend to exhibit greater competitiveness compared to the female MPs. Overall, our findings enhance our understanding of how cross-country benchmarking shapes domestic policy-making.","Keywords: Political Elites, Elite Communication, Public Policy, Policy Learning","Winnie Xia","Winnie Xia","Aarhus University"," Roman Senninger","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0931_0116_0063.html","Persuasion by Changing Issue Priorities: Immigration and Population Decline in Japan","How can potential public backlash to Japan's rapidly expanding immigration be minimized? We investigated whether immigration can gain and maintain public support when voters understand that it can help address other nationally important issues, such as Japan’s demographic challenges. Building on our previous research, we conducted a large-scale survey experiment in Japan with two main objectives: (1) to measure voters’ perceived importance of immigration and population decline alongside their specific policy preferences, and (2) to test whether these attitudes change when voters are exposed to information about the national benefits of various immigration and population policies. Since a significant portion of Japanese citizens had not yet formed strong opinions on immigration, Japan served as an ideal setting to examine attitude formation and change. Our preliminary results show that when voters were presented with information highlighting how immigration or population policies could alleviate pressing demographic issues, there was a notable increase in support for these policies. Specifically, we observed that voters’ preferences and perceived importance of specific subissues, such as immigration admission numbers, were positively influenced by the information provided. However, when counter-information about possible negative impacts of immigration or population growth was introduced, these positive effects were somewhat mitigated but not entirely reversed. Overall, our findings suggest that informing the public about the benefits of immigration in addressing demographic challenges can positively influence attitudes, even in culturally conservative contexts where significant immigration has long been considered to be impossible.","Keywords: Issue Salience, Information Provision, Immigration Policy, Public Opinion","Alexander Kustov","Alexander Kustov",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UNC Charlotte",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0932_1022_1255.html","Relative exposure to trade and group status threat: The political consequences of the China shock in Brazil","How does the changing composition of trade due to the China shock affect election outcomes in emerging economies? While some political economists have argued that the distribution of shocks across race and income shapes electoral outcomes, most of the literature on the political consequences of globalization ignores the compositional effects of trade, and micro-level evidence -- particularly in emerging economies -- remains scant. We assess whether relative differences in exposure to trade across skill and racial lines shape electoral outcomes in Brazil. We argue that the rise of China generates a relative status threat along skill and racial lines. A rise in manufactured imports presents an economic threat to relatively skilled (white) workers who may lose access to well-paying, formal sector jobs. A simultaneous boom in primary exports has benefited relatively less skilled workers (who are also more likely to be non-white). The changing composition of trade creates new winners and losers. We consider how these relative economic pressures generate support for left or far-right parties. To examine this empirically, we link administrative data on individual employees with data on industry level imports and exports. Using variation in industry-specific trade shocks interacted with industry employment shares by group in the local labor market, we generate trade-induced local labor demand shocks by group. We examine how the relative exposure to negative (import) and positive (export) shocks influences support for different parties in presidential elections from 2002 to 2022.","Keywords: Globalization, electoral support, emerging countries","Irene Menéndez González","Irene Menéndez González","IE University","Erica Owen","University of Pittsburgh","Daniel Jones","University of Pittsburgh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IE University","University of Pittsburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0933_0186_1312.html","Women and the Adoption of Proportional Electoral System","Did women play a role in the adoption of proportional representation system? In this paper, we explore how women’s suffrage at the turn of the 20th century shaped politicians’ propensity to vote for the adoption of proportional electoral system (PR) in Norway. Extant literature uncovers two broad explanations for adoption of PR. One emphasizes strategic/instrumental incentives of parties and employers (e.g. Leemann and Mares 2014; Cusack et al 2010; Boix 1999; Cox et al 2018). The other emphasizes normative-based demands from voters and politicians (Blais et al 2004; Bol et al 2015). However, neither account considers the role of women. Whilst most Western countries that adopted PR at the turn of the twentieth century did so before women gained equal voting rights, this was not always the case. A notable exception is Norway (see Skorge 2023, Teele 2023), where women’s suffrage (1909, 1915 election years) was adopted before the switch to PR at the national level (and partly also local level) (1921 election year). In this paper, we fill this gap by studying the role of women in adopting PR in Norway. Utilizing sex-separated data on turnout and roll calls of legislative support for PR, we find that politicians were more likely to support PR adoption in districts with high female turnout. By showing that men’s turnout is not correlated with politicians’ propensity to support PR, we cast doubts on the possibility that these results reflect men’s preference for PR or demands for greater democratization of a highly active electorate.","Keywords: proportional representation, political institutions, gender, electoral system","Oda Nedregård","Oda Nedregård","Sciences Po","Mona Morgan-Collins","King's College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po","King's College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A downstream consequence of this linkage is that support for non-contentious issues can become linked to contentious issues. In this project, we examine the consequences of such linkages by focusing on how public support for sexual minority rights (a popular, non-contentious issue) became linked to the Israel/Palestine conflict (a contentious issue) in connection with the 2024 Copenhagen Pride Festival. We hypothesize that linking these issues will decrease support for the rights of sexual minorities, and that this decreased support might extend to rights of gender minorities (a related, but less widely supported issue), and support for climate change mitigation (a widely supported, but ideologically adjacent issue). We test our hypoteses in a pre-registered survey based-priming experiment conducted in Denmark, where we randomly assign participants to conditions either implicitly or explicitly linking Pride to the Israel/Palestine conflict, or to a control conditions with no linkage. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of identity politics, issue linkages, and issue advocacy.","Keywords: Support for sexual minorities, Identity politics, issue linkage, Denmark, experiments.","Peter Dinesen, Kim Sønderskov","Peter Dinesen","University of Copenhagen","Kim Sønderskov","Aarhus University","Matthias Avina","University of Copenhagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Copenhagen","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some of this research suggests higher influence for the affluent while other work pushes back on these findings by highlighting the large overlap in the policy preferences of the two groups. Yet regardless of the conclusions, this work has lacked data on the groups’ policy priorities, which may influence the issues that politicians address. In this paper, we analyze the first-order question of whether the affluent and general public have similar policy priorities. We do so within the context of the United States, by conducting an original survey on a national sample of the affluent, a comparison sample of the general population, and a comparison sample of campaign donors given that they comprise a politically influential population that overlaps with affluence. The results indicate that the policy priorities of the affluent and donors differ systematically from those of the general population, including when the comparison involves respondents from the same party. The final section of the paper considers how these differences relate to politicians’ policy incentives and evidence on the influence of donors and affluent individuals.","Keywords: Policy Priorities, Importance of Issues, Donors, Affluent, Mass Opinion","Brandice Canes-Wrone","Brandice Canes-Wrone","Stanford University","Michael Barber","Brigham Young University","Joshua Clinton","Vanderbilt University","Gregory Huber","Yale University","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University","Brigham Young University","Vanderbilt University","Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Far less is known, however, about the conflict's impact on prejudice elsewhere. We bring this question to China, where both government and public overwhelmingly side with the Palestinians. Building on existing studies of historical prejudice against Muslims in China, primarily the Hui and Uyghur minorities, our study will examine whether the conflict in Gaza, where narratives with both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are inescapable, significantly placates or exacerbates these prejudices in China’s domestic politics.On one hand, the salience of Islamic militancy may increase Islamophobia among Chinese citizens if it heightens perceptions of local Muslim minorities as national security concerns. Alternatively, Islamophobia might be tempered when the Chinese government’s support for Palestine frames the Muslim community as a geopolitical ally. We will test both possibilities through a preregistered online survey experiment with 3,000 Chinese citizens. In the experiment, respondents will be randomly exposed to either information on the Gaza conflict alone or information on both the conflict and the Chinese government’s support for Palestinian authorities. We will then measure respondents' prejudice toward domestic Muslim groups, such as the Hui and Uyghurs. The findings of this study will offer crucial insights into how international conflicts shape domestic social relations in the Chinese and adjacent contexts.","Keywords: China, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, prejudice, conflict","Afiq bin Oslan","Tony Zirui Yang","University of Oxford","Afiq bin Oslan","Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An important unexplored domain in this paradigm is the mitigation process for misinformation. Some earlier studies have shown that correcting misbeliefs is difficult (Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Arceneaux and Wielen 2017). People tend to create their echo chambers with self-confirming beliefs in service of their prior attitudes and preferences (Suhay and Erisen 2018). Similar studies on conspiracy beliefs have also shown various aspects of the issue, primarily its consequences and identity-driven precedents (Miller, Saunders, and Farhart 2016; Federico, Williams, and Vitriol 2018). Yet, while earlier studies have explored various aspects of the issue, behavioral correction mechanisms of misinformation have not been studied, especially in non-WEIRD environments (Turkey and South Korea in this project).Nationally representative data (already) collected in the project’s first stage involving survey experiments unravels the mechanism of mitigating misinformation behavior.

"abstract_0938_1512_1500.html","Industrial Emission Reductions as Political Favors","Environmental protection and climate change mitigation rely heavily on companies fulfilling their pledges to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. However, research suggests that such pledges often serve as ""greenwashing"" strategies with limited impact. This raises the question: under what conditions do firms meaningfully reduce industrial emissions? We argue that firms are more likely to reduce emissions when GHG abatement can serve as political leverage due to its visible and localized benefits. We focus on lobbying relationships with elected representatives and argue that firms strategically focus emission reductions in the constituencies of their lobbying targets. This allows local representatives to claim credit for environmental improvements, aligning with their electoral interests. Similar to job creation in local economic development, firms trade concentrated emission reductions for favorable regulatory outcomes. We support our argument with two separate analyses of geo-referenced data on industrial emissions and lobbying activities in the US and Brazil (2010–2023). Findings reveal that firms significantly reduce emissions in facilities located within the constituencies of their lobbied representatives, particularly for pollutants like methane (CH4) and hydrofluorocarbons that heavily impact air quality. The effect is driven by lobbying relationships with incumbent politicians running for re-election and becomes stronger as elections approach. These results advance our understanding of corporate environmental behavior, climate lobbying, and the geographical dynamics of the political economy of emissions. By highlighting the political conditions under which firms implement emission reductions, we shed light on the interplay between corporate strategies and environmental outcomes.","Keywords: corporate emission-reduction, corporate lobbying, local economic development, US, Brazil","Lorenzo Crippa","Lorenzo Crippa","University of Strathclyde","Manoel Gehrke","University of Pisa","Dafni Kalatzi Pantera","University of Birmingham","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Strathclyde","University of Pisa","University of Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) These donor contractors tend to continue receiving public contracts even after losing direct political connections in subsequent election cycles, suggesting that their donations grant them extended access beyond immediate reciprocation.

Building on these results, we conduct a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in collaboration with investigative journalists, NGOs, and the Office of the Inspector General in Colombia to study how new mayors respond to deterrence messages about contract scrutiny for their donors.

The strategies that have consistently positive effects on candidate credibility, providing community services and attending local events, are more effective for male candidates. The strategies that can potentially backfire either only have negative repercussions for women candidates (rallies) or have stronger negative effects on women’s credibility than on men’s (electoral handouts).

Therefore, we ask whether people engage in protest behavior against the government when the wealthy avoid paying taxes. And if they do (not), why (not)? We argue that upon learning that the affluent avoid paying taxes, individuals develop certain emotions, i.e., anger, contempt, and disgust, depending on their moral perceptions of the country’s tax regime. If individuals perceive the system to be unfair-and-unjust or fair-but-unjust, tax avoidance angers them, which, in turn, increases their willingness to protest. However, if they perceive the system to be fair-and-just or unfair-but-just, they feel contempt and disgust, respectively. These emotions reduce the tendency to protest.

While much research has examined democratic backsliding in established democracies, less is known about how terrorism affects public attitudes in non-Western regions where regimes struggle to combat such threats effectively. This study explores whether exposure to terrorism undermines public support for democracy in non-Western contexts. We employ two empirical strategies. First, we conduct an online survey experiment in Burkina Faso, priming respondents on terrorism to assess its impact on democratic attitudes. Second, we use geocoded observational data by matching AfroBarometer respondents from all African countries to the nearest terrorist attack locations at the time of their interviews. This proximity serves as a measure of terrorism exposure, allowing us to estimate its causal effect on democratic support using the (random) timing of attacks. By combining survey experiments with observational data, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how terrorism influences democratic attitudes. It aims to uncover whether such threats universally erode democracy or create opportunities to strengthen it in non-Western contexts.","Keywords: Terrorism, democratic attitudes, Africa, public opinion, survey experiment, Burkina Faso","Souleymane Yameogo","Souleymane Yameogo","University of Glasgow"," Anja Neundorf","University of Glasgow"," Aykut Öztürk","University of Glasgow","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Glasgow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0944_1713_0542.html","Political Bias in Transitional Justice: Evidence from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission","Transitional justice institutions are popular tools for addressing past human rights violations in post-conflict societies, but they often operate under intense political pressure. We argue that, while striving for impartiality, actors in these institutions face strong incentives to favor incumbents - especially in politically unstable contexts. We explore this tension using a unique dataset of amnesty decisions from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (1996–2001), the only transitional justice institution to have released comprehensive records of its decisions. Our analysis reveals a consistent pattern of favoritism toward members of the incumbent African National Congress (ANC), alongside systematic bias against their political rivals, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Results are robust to controlling dynamically for all features of the cases and are unlikely to be driven by unobserved variables. Notably, no such favoritism extended to other anti-apartheid organizations, nor did we find higher rejection rates among former apartheid officials. We explore mechanisms behind our results. On the demand side, ANC control over appointments during later expansions of the judging panel led to the inclusion of politically aligned judges. On the supply side, career ambitions played a role: judges who exhibited bias were more likely to pursue higher judicial or political positions after their TRC service. Qualitative evidence from hearing transcripts reveals that IFP members faced systematically higher evidentiary standards than ANC members for comparable offenses. Our findings highlight the importance of multiparty involvement in appointing transitional justice officials and provide rare insights into the behavior of transitional justice institutions.","Keywords: transitional justice, political bias, amnesty, judicial incentives","Daniel Urquijo","Daniel Urquijo","European University Institute","Amuitz Garmendia Madariaga","Universidad Carlos III Madrid","Paul Zachary","Independent Researcher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","Universidad Carlos III Madrid","Independent Researcher",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0945_1420_0581.html","Labour market demand and attitudes towards immigration","Economic theories of attitudes towards immigration are heavily contested. While labour market competition was once dominant in trying to make sense of raising levels of public anti-immigrant sentiment, cultural anxieties are now considered the main, if not the sole driver of inter-group hostility. Traditional labour market theories, however, rest on questionable assumptions, such as wage maximization being the key determinant of attitudes and native workers being fully aware of migrant inflows at their skill levels. We challenge these assumptions, proposing instead that labour demand, not supply, plays a critical role in shaping economic perceptions of immigration. To test this, we compile a novel, granular dataset linking vacancy rates and labour market tightness to individual attitudes. Our data spans 1999–2024, integrating monthly-year trends from Germany’s Household Panel (GSOEP) with regional (NUTS 1) and occupational (ISCO-3d) dynamics. Preliminary analyses using longitudinal models reveal that higher vacancy rates strongly predict lower anti-immigrant sentiment, independent of static confounders like cosmopolitan self-selection into migrant-friendly regions or occupations. Mechanistically, we find that lower egocentric fears of competition and perceived job insecurity under tight labour markets drive these attitudes. This study contributes to the literature by emphasizing economic over cultural factors and self-interest over sociotropic frameworks. Future work will enhance causal robustness through quasi-random variations in sectoral and regional policy changes, such as post-Covid relaxation of employment restrictions. By shifting focus to labour demand and scarcity, we provide a fresh perspective on the economic underpinnings of inter-group hostility.","Keywords: Attitudes towards immigration, labour market, longitudinal analysis, vacancy rates","Sergi Pardos-Prado","Sergi Pardos-Prado","University of Glasgow","Josep Serrano","Universidad Carlos III","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Glasgow","Universidad Carlos III",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0946_2270_0654.html","The Electoral Consequences of Decolonization in France: The Pieds Noirs and the Transformation of Nice.","In 1962, Algeria achieved its independence from France. This event prompted the return to the Metropole of one million French citizens who had resided in Algeria for more than a century, known as the “Pieds Noirs”. The economic and social consequences of the repatriation to France of these voters generated great animosity toward the central government that affected their electoral behavior. In this regard, this was not only a demographic or economic phenomenon but a potent political catalyst. Among the one million Pieds Noirs, 40,000 migrant citizens chose to settle in the city of Nice, leading to a 20% population surge virtually overnight. The city transitioned from a pivotal political arena to a radical right stronghold, anti-Gaullist in nature, making Nice one of today's main electoral bastions for the French Far-Right.Using historical municipal-level data, this paper tests the existence of a link between this transformation in Nice's electoral identity and the mass immigration of Pieds Noirs using Causal Inference. Our findings extend beyond the specific case of this city, delving into the often-overlooked electoral repercussions of colonialism on the voters of the former colonial state and the influence of immigration on voting behavior.","Keywords: #voting #Far-right #Migration #France #Pied-noirs #Colonialism","Rebeca G.

"abstract_0947_2082_0764.html","Changing Norms in EU Return Policy? A longitudinal analysis of Commission documents on return","Returning migrants without an authorisation to stay has become a major policy focus of the EU’s migration policy since the 2015/2016 ‘migration crisis’ resulting in a perception that return is increasingly taking centre stage in both the EU’s internal migration policies and in relations with neighbouring and developing. However, thus far these developments have been studied mainly in the form of case studies covering specific instruments or non-EU countries, and hence we lack a longitudinal and comprehensive assessment of the role of return for EU migration policies. This paper aims to trace the evolution of return policy norms by analysing a novel corpus of Commission policy documents and press releases related to migration and return between 1985 and 2024, using descriptive and machine learning methods of text analysis. We find that the prominence of return overall has not consistently increased over time. We also do not find a linear increase in the external dimension and cooperation with third countries, but rather a change in focus from development funding to connecting return to visa facilitation and back to questions of development. In addition, border control has gained prominence within return-related documents over time. We also find significant differences in the topics covered in policy documents and press releases, with development-related topics and visa liberalisation being more prominent in press releases than in policy documents. The findings shed light on our understanding of the EU’s return policy and of the norms the Commission highlights both in policy and in public communication.","Keywords: EU migration policy, return policy, European Commission, norms","Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik","Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik","University of Cologne","Philipp Stutz","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Cologne","Vrije Universiteit Brussel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0948_0786_0828.html","Talking the talk, marching the march? Protest mobilization by populist parties across Europe","Populist parties often instrumentalize protest politics to bolster their narratives of standing by common people and attacking the elites. As a result, populism and protest have repeatedly been linked theoretically. However, we lack a comparative analysis of populist parties’ involvement in protest politics, showing whether populist parties indeed rely more on protest to mobilize support. We fill this gap by analyzing the links between populist parties and contentious politics in two arenas. Using both protest event data and a comprehensive dataset of MPs' social media communication on Twitter and Facebook across 28 European legislatures between 2018 and 2023, we examine the communication and the actual behavior of populist parties regarding protest. Results show that populist parties are not fundamentally different from non-populist parties regarding protest politics. While populist parties are frequently active in the streets and produce a high amount of protest-related content on social media, this can be explained by their radical ideologies more than by their populist discourse. We also identify conditions under which parties are more likely to engage in street politics. These findings contribute to a growing literature that questions the effects of populism, and help us better understand the mobilization efforts of radical parties.","Keywords: populist parties, protest, social media, party strategy, mobilization","Leonhard Schmidt","Leonhard Schmidt","Hertie School, Berlin","Bruno Castanho Silva","Freie Universität, Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School, Berlin","Freie Universität, Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How do MNCs influence the creation of these private standards? This paper argues that MNCs utilize their global subsidiary networks to exert influence in international private regimes. Specifically, the one-country-one-vote system in the ISO standardization process incentivizes MNCs to leverage their connections with host countries---particularly those previously inactive in standard-setting---to garner the votes needed for standard approval. Using original panel data on voting membership across 758 ISO technical committees, covering 165 countries from 2007 to 2017, the  findings reveal that national standard developing bodies are more likely to participate in standardization in areas where they have received related inward foreign direct investments. Furthermore, utilizing information on project leaders for each ISO standard, the study identifies firms with specific interests in establishing certain standards. The results demonstrate that investments from these firms specifically lead to host country participation in the relevant standard-setting areas. These findings suggest that certain international institutions may disproportionately empower MNCs compared to  firms without global subsidiary networks.","Keywords: international standards, international organizations, multinational corporations, foreign direct investment, ISO","Sayumi Miyano","Sayumi Miyano",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Osaka University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building on research from studies of political parties and gender and politics, we evaluate the extent of bias introduced by LLMs when they are used to reduce the quantity and linguistic complexity of parliamentary debates. We hypothesise that AI systems amplify existing societal biases such as gender stereotypes in the resulting summaries of political discourse. Focusing on debates within the European Parliament, we compare a variety of outputs generated by open and closed source LLMs through a comparative analysis of political preference measurements. We contrast scaled position estimates of AI-generated speech summaries with position estimates derived from the original parliamentary speeches from which summaries are generated. Through a systematic comparison of both open and closed source models, our findings reveal the extent of bias introduced into AI-generated texts.

Furthermore, we explore how these data can shed light on the success and failure of state performance.

Traditionally, PSE has been measured using self-reported media consumption data. However, limitations have been demonstrated with the use of self-reported data in research on media consumption and these limitations could potentially be contributing to the inconsistent findings regarding PSE. To address this methodological limitation, this study introduces an innovative computational method for measuring PSE based on participant's consumed digital news contentUsing web-tracking and survey data from 829 Spanish respondents during the 2023 Spanish elections, the study analyses 22.000 digital news articles containing political content. Employing High Performance Computing (HPC) and the Llama 3.1 70b Large Language Model, the sentiment and stances toward key political actors in these articles are assessed. PSE is then calculated by evaluating the alignment of the content with each respondent’s ideological positioning along the left-right and liberal-conservative continua, while controlling for engagement metrics such as article length and time spent reading. Finally, the study examines the correspondence between the PSE derived from content analysis of consumed digital news and self-reported digital news consumption. This comparison provides insights into the reliability of self-reported data in digital media and selective exposure research. By overcoming the biases of traditional self-report methods, this computational approach advances the study of PSE offering a more accurate understanding of its antecedents and effects.","Keywords: Partisan Selective Exposure (PSE), digital news, large language models, web-tracking data","Nienke Visscher","Nienke Visscher","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)","Laia Castro Herrero","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC); University of Barcelona (UB)","Yuan Zhang","University of Zurich (UZH)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)","University of Barcelona (UB)","University of Zurich (UZH)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0954_1208_0066.html","Immigrant Reactions to Outgroup Exposure","Western countries are experiencing rapid demographic change, with immigrants from different backgrounds living in the same host countries. The literature has mainly analyzed how natives react to these demographic changes, treating immigrants as a homogeneous group without agency.This paper adopts a different strategy and examines how immigrants react when confronted with other types of immigrants. Essentially, we develop a framework that considers that there is a ""native"" population, the ingroup, and two types of outgroups, OG1 and OG2. OG1 are culturally closer to the natives than OG2. This article examines the reactions of OG1 when exposed to OG2 population growth. First, similar to Abascal (2015), we aim to investigate whether OG1 feel closer to the native population when exposed to OG2 population growth.Second, we advance this research by investigating how this response occurs. Specifically, we examine how OG1 attempt to actively differentiate themselves from OG2, considering two strategies: i) emphasizing cultural differences between OG2 and natives, essentially discriminating against OG2; ii) assimilating to host country values.We test various implications of the model using in Spain - an ideal case in which there is a clear OG1 (Latinos) and OG2 (Moroccans) - with observational data and an experiment. The treatment group is informed about the huge increase in the Moroccan population, while the control group is not. After the information treatment, they answer questions about their perceived similarity to natives, their subjective status, their preference for cultural homogeneity and their social values.

Numerous studies suggest that import competition impacts local labor markets in Western democracies, fueling a backlash against globalization, political polarization, and the rise of populist and right-wing parties. We shift attention to a new, thus far largely unexplored political consequence. Blending material- and identity-based arguments, we suggest that economic pressures from global markets move voter preferences toward political candidates with local ties. While subtle compared to broader shifts in party systems, these local ties are a key aspect of descriptive representation, influencing governance and district advocacy. We further identify several attributes of the local economy that shape this link between economic globalization and local representation. We test our argument in the context of the United States, combining data on the exposure of Congressional Districts to import competition with newly available data on legislator characteristics, product-, industry-, and district-level attributes, and election outcomes.

A long tradition attributes policy outcomes to executives, downplaying the importance of legislatures in the process. In this article, we present a novel concept on legislatures' political positions as key to defining more or less favorable political environments within which policies are adopted. Empirically, we propose novel measures of legislatures' positions aggregating party-level measurements for 3,467 parties represented in 178 lower chambers between 1970 and 2019 on four key dimensions: economy, exclusion, religion, and democracy. Connecting these with eleven policy outcomes, we show that they are not only significant predictors of welfare universalism, anti-immigration, LGBT inclusion, and climate change policies but also that they outperform the governments' stances as an explanatory factor. This is valid across democracies and autocracies alike for most outcomes, yet legislatures in democratic regimes are better in passing policies compared to democratic governments and autocratic institutions. Furthermore, we also find that electoral design (i.e., majoritarian, proportional, or mixed) and electoral thresholds mediate several effects, while the differences between presidential and parliamentary systems is not influential. These results provide evidence for a broader approach to public policy that incorporates legislatures’ positions.","Keywords: Legislatures, governments, representation, public policy, measurement","Fabio Angiolillo","Felix Weibrecht","University of Liverpool","Fabio Angiolillo","University of Gothenburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","University of Liverpool",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0957_1251_1390.html","From Parties to Citizens: What Belongs to the Cultural Cleavage and Why does it Differ Across Countries?","Political competition has become increasingly focused around a cultural cleavage, dividing green, alternative, and libertarian (GAL) positions from traditionalist, authoritarian, and nationalist (TAN) stances. Scholarship so far has treated the set of issues within the GAL-TAN dimension as a cohesive whole, overlooking potential cross-national variation and relying on an implicit assumption of equivalence. Addressing this assumption, this paper investigates how the specific issues that citizens bundle together to form this cleavage diverge across countries. I argue that elite polarization and far-right issue entrepreneurship influence which issues citizens incorporate into the cultural cleavage. Focusing on two issues, namely LGBTQ rights and climate change, this study uses multilevel confirmatory factor analysis to analyze how dynamics of party competition shape citizens’ embedding of these issues into the cultural dimension across 31 European countries. The findings reveal that in countries where parties are more polarized along LGBTQ rights, citizens’ attitudes towards LGBTQ are more strongly linked to their views on immigration and European integration. Conversely, in contexts of little party polarization over LGBTQ rights, citizens do not link this issue to other cultural issues. Moreover, where far-right parties take more extreme positions on climate change, citizens more strongly connect their attitudes towards climate to other cultural concerns, while this pattern is not observed where the far-right takes more a centrist position. These results challenge the assumption of a uniform cultural cleavage across Europe and highlight the role of party competition in shaping issue-bundling among citizens.","Keywords: Cleavages Theory, Elite Cues, Mass Attitudes","Lara Zwittlinger","Lara Zwittlinger",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Salzburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How do the answers vary for different groups in society? We explore the concept of inequality through an open-ended survey question rather than treating inequality as a descriptive or self-evident term. In a two-wave panel survey, we asked over 4,000 respondents to describe the societal inequalities that come to mind in the German context. Responses were categorized through a combination of computational analysis and human expertise. We find that privileged groups tend to omit the types of inequalities that benefit them, while disadvantaged groups actively highlight those that affect them. For example, women frequently mention gender inequality and Eastern Germans highlight east-west disparities. Notably, the perception of economic inequality deviates from this pattern: there is no relationship between respondents’ objective income or wealth levels, and their propensity to mention economic inequality-related topics. This cleavage in perceptions of inequality highlights the lack of demand for redistributive policy among economically disadvantaged groups. The second survey wave, conducted two years later, reveals the (in-)stability of respondents’ perception of inequality. This study makes three contributions. First, we provide a deeper understanding of citizens’ perceptions of inequality. Second, we contribute to methodological discussions on how to best measure inequality by using an open question. Third, we provide a multilevel dictionary for future research to categorize different kinds of inequality in various degrees of detail.","Keywords: inequality, perceptions, open question","Felix Jäger","Franco Bastias","Grenoble Alpes University","Felix Jäger","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","Nanna Lauritz Schönhage","Norwegian University of Science and Technology","Sergio Eugenio Zanotto","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","","","","","","","","","","","","","Grenoble Alpes University","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","Norwegian University of Science and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0962_0837_0160.html","No Corrupt Friend of Mine: Electoral Effects of Political Dissociation in Corruption Networks","Corruption scandals can reshape political careers in democratic elections. While voters typically punish corrupt politicians, scandals also impact the careers of those indirectly implicated through party affiliations or leadership roles, as voters extend this punishment to affiliated politicians. To mitigate these effects, indirectly implicated politicians often dissociate from overtly corrupt individuals. This paper examines how political dissociation serves as a strategy to reduce electoral punishment and explores its effects on the electoral fortunes of indirectly implicated politicians. Dissociation efforts include switching parties or, within the same party, distancing through public statements, limiting collaboration, or reconfiguring voting alignments. The influence of political and corruption networks—defined by voting patterns, party ties, and personal characteristics—shapes dissociation decisions and their electoral consequences. The paper argues that dissociation within a network moderates the negative electoral impact of indirect corruption involvement. A game-theoretical model of network formation shows how politicians sever ties with implicated actors to reduce electoral risks as the cost of being indirectly linked to corruption increases. To test this argument, the paper analyzes nearly 30 years (1992–2019) of network data from Brazilian congresspersons. Political ties are identified through voting patterns, speech similarities, and electoral data. The findings suggest that stronger indirect connections to corruption lead to greater electoral losses, emphasizing the importance of dissociation as a strategic response to scandals.","Keywords: Corruption Scandals, Political Dissociation, Electoral Punishment, Networks","Carlos Gueiros","Carlos Gueiros",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Being able to forecast the occurrence of regime breakdown would therefore be of great interest and potential importance to organizations and other actors who want, e.g., to forestall coups, aid democratization processes, or safeguard civilians in the run-up to or aftermath of a regime breakdown. In this paper, we build and present high-performing predictive models to forecast breakdowns of political regimes in countries across the world. More specifically, we construct models that give monthly forecasts for aggregate regime breakdowns as well as for four particularly important sub-types of breakdowns, namely coups d’état, self-coups, popular uprisings, and incumbent-guided liberalization. Leveraging the Historical Regimes Data (HRD), we can base our predictions on more than 230 years of political history and over 2000 regimes changes, recorded with high temporal resolution and nuanced information on exactly how they broke down. As our predictive baseline, we train a set of machine-learning models using the predictors specified by Djuve, Knutsen and Wig (2020), which are a restrictive set of features selected for their theoretical relevance to the regime change literature. Thereafter, we compare the predictive performance ofour baseline model to those of various thematic models trained with the same classifiers. Finally, we use ensemble methods to produce true forecasts of the likelihood of regime breakdown for all countries,  globally, in the coming three years.","Keywords: regime change, prediction, machine learning, democratization","Vilde Djuve","Vilde Djuve","University of Oslo","David Randahl","Uppsala University","Carl Henrik Knutsen","University of Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oslo","Uppsala University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our findings show, how in the era of mass provision of compulsory state education, military conflict continues to trigger politicization of education, but only in consolidated autocracies that already have centralized policymaking power.

"abstract_0965_1826_0543.html","Benefits of Loyal Judiciary: Evidence from Moscow District Courts Judges","Autocrats commonly use legalized repression, where ordinary courts are involved in prosecuting the opposition or ordinary citizens. Yet we do not know whether judges actually receive any benefits from partaking in politically motivated trials. I test this proposition using data from modern Russia, where repression is widespread and commonly used (McCarthy et al., 2023; Tertytchnaya, 2023). I focus on district courts judges in Moscow, from 2000 until 2022. Moscow in itself is a federal district; and provides enough variation among district courts, judges, and types of cases entering the system. Using a dataset on politically motivated criminal and administrative cases from OVD-Info and Memorial NGO with self-collected dataset on biographies of judges and their financial disclosures, I examine whether judges receive a promotion or material gains shortly before or after deciding a politically motivated case.  With this study, I aim to contribute to our knowledge of bureaucracy in authoritarian regimes and to highlight the role individuals play in political repression. By focusing on district court judges, I will examine the role of ordinary courts, thereby shifting focus from studies on higher/constitutional courts. My focus on Russian judges will fill the gap by providing empirical evidence of the role of ordinary judges in everyday repression and the incentives underlying their decisions.","Keywords: judicial politics, authoritarian politics, repression, Russian politics, law & society","Yulia Khalikova","Yulia Khalikova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Hamburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We formulate a model of programmatic versus clientelistic politics and show that elites choose different clientelist strategies or policy platforms in order to capture the state, depending upon the composition of the electorate.By integrating models of clientelism and pork-barrel politics, this paper seeks to answer two primary questions: first, under what conditions do rent-seeking elites choose a particular form of vote-targeting over another; and second, why do clientelistic parties utilize pre-election transfers as an electoral strategy despite a secret ballot? We do so by allowing for programmatic as well as competence differences by candidate and studying the behaviour of an electorate that has a significant informal sector. The primary contribution is to delineate the conditions under which programmatic platforms (for instance, tax policy) are less deterministic than signaling via pre- or post-election targeted transfers, and how the resultant policy distortions contribute to extraction by elites from the state.","Keywords: State Capture, Clientelism, Rent Seeking, Elite Capture, Formal Theory, Inefficient Institutions, Predatory States","Ameetosri (Amy) Basu","Ameetosri (Amy) Basu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Can such regimes entice politically motivated emigrants to return through selective incentives or improved economic opportunities, or is comprehensive regime change the only pathway to reversing such a brain drain? We argue that these efforts interact with conditions migrants encounter in host countries, which may themselves be experiencing democratic backsliding—or, as is often the case for Russian emigrants, already be autocratic. Under such circumstances, how do host-country political, legal, and economic conditions, combined with changes in the autocratic homeland, shape migrants’ decisions to return, relocate elsewhere, or remain abroad?To answer these questions, we draw on data from a large-scale conjoint experiment with 7,500 war-induced Russian emigrants residing in around 100 countries, supplemented by 500 qualitative interviews and a longitudinal panel survey. Our findings illuminate the complex interplay of home- and host-country dynamics and provide new insights into the factors that drive return intentions and actual migration outcomes among politically motivated emigrants.","Keywords: brain drain, autocracy, political migration, return migration, exile","Emil Kamalov","Emil Kamalov","European University Institute","Ivetta Sergeeva","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0968_2300_0653.html","The Lasting Impact of Economic Hardship: How Context Shapes the Development of Partisan Identification","While existing literature emphasize how party attachment is reinforced with age through repeated participation and vote choice, I argue that the economic context during an individual's first voting experience plays a critical role in shaping long-term partisan ties. This paper shows that coming of age during periods of economic hardship leaves a lasting impact on partisan identification (PID). Using unemployment rates as a proxy for government performance during formative political years, I analyze individuals born between 1945 and 2003 with data from the CSES, EES, and ESS.The results reveal that those who came of age during economic turmoil are less likely to develop PID and, when they do, are less inclined to identify with the incumbent party in power during their formative years. To explore the mediating role of the act of voting and party choice, I leverage variation in electoral eligibility of equally aged individuals exposed to these poor-performing mandates. Findings suggest that eligibility during periods of economic instability fosters electoral volatility in youth, which persists over the life cycle. This research stresses the importance of context in early political experiences for the understanding of lifelong patterns of electoral behavior and partisan ties.","Keywords: Partisan Identification, Political Socialization, Recessions, Europe","Jose Maycas-Sardi","Jose Maycas-Sardi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0969_2190_0765.html","The Ideational Leadership of EU Institutions: A Text Analysis of EU foreign policy on Ukraine","This paper investigates the ideational leadership of EU institutions. It conceptualises ideational leadership as the capacity of institutional actors to steer EU policymaking through ideas about principles, programmes and instruments. Such ideas operate at three levels of generality – at a macro level, philosophical ideas concern the values and principles of the EU; at a meso-level, programmatic ideas pertain to agenda-setting and strategic objectives; and at a micro-level, policy ideas reflect specific policy instruments. Based on these ideational levels, the paper puts forward three distinct types of ideational leadership, i.e. normative leadership, which defines the values and principles of the EU; political leadership, which articulates EU priorities and action programmes; and technical leadership, which influences the elaboration and establishment of EU policy tools. To assess the validity of the proposed theoretical approach, the paper examines two case studies of EU foreign policy: the 2014 Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its subsequent destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine; and the 2022 Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and ensuing war. It analyses 1600 speeches for a total of over 100k sentences using text-as-data approaches. It finds that programmatic ideas are the most prevalent, while policy ones are relatively sparser. However, their relative prevalence varies across actors and over the two periods. The paper contributes to the literatures on ideational leadership, EU foreign policy institutional dynamics and the integration of member states’ core state powers.","Keywords: EU institutions, EU leadership, EU foreign and security policy, Ukraine, text-as-data","Matilde Ceron","Maria Giulia Amadio","LUISS University","Andrea Capati","LUISS University","Matilde Ceron","University of Salzburg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LUISS University","University of Salzburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A fine-grained analysis of mainstream parties’ responses to the radical right using parliamentary speeches","Are mainstream parties becoming more Eurosceptic in reaction to the success of radical right Eurosceptic parties? While the existing literature on party competition points out that mainstream parties are responding by moving closer to their radical right rivals on certain issues (Meijers 2017; Abou-Chadi 2021), these studies primarily capture positional shifts by using data from party manifestos or expert surveys, focusing solely on changes between election years. This study adopts a different approach and analyses parliamentary speeches to assess whether this Eurosceptic shift represents a lasting change or is a merely temporary adjustment confined to election periods. We expect the effect of radical right success on mainstream party stances to be gradual and cumulative, intensifying as elections approach and depending more on the sustained success of radical right parties over multiple election cycles than on the magnitude of their success in the immediately preceding elections. Building on the ParlSpeech dataset, we analyze speeches from plenary sessions in 8 key legislatures, covering a 20-year period.  We employ a neural network classifier to categorize speeches at the sentence level into five issue domains reflecting key areas of EU contestation: Cultural, Socioeconomic, Legitimacy, EU Reforms, and Enlargement. The aggregated party-level scores are our measure of party stance. The radical right’s vote share in the previous election, the time until the next election, and their interaction are the key independent variables. The paper aims to shed light on whether Eurosceptic shifts are part of a broader strategic realignment or a limited electoral strategy.","Keywords: Radical Right, Euroscepticism, Text-as-data, Party competition","Leandre Benoit, Duarte Amaro","Leandre Benoit","University of Oxford"," Duarte Amaro","University of Oxford","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, little is known about how firms allocate responsibility across these domains. By considering multiple domains at once, I find that firms prioritize their efforts to uphold environmental norms (""E"") over social (""S"") and governance (""G"") norms when they are pressured by customer firms and countries. This supports a new theory of firm obfuscation, in which competition in supply chains and the bundling of ratings across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) domains, incentivize firms to improve in less costly domains. To empirically test this theory, I match firm-level supply chain relationships to five datasets containing ESG ratings, ESG risk incidents, shareholder ESG proposals, country-level ESG regulatory instruments, and firm characteristics. Using a two-way fixed effect design, I show that supplier firms prioritize ""E"" more than ""S"" and ""G"" when faced with pressure from their customer firms’ shareholders. Additionally, when subject to regulations incorporating ESG standards in the countries of their customer firms, supplier firms are more inclined to enhance both ""E"" and ""S"" practices compared to ""G.""","Keywords: Supply Chains, diffusion of norms, labor norms, environmental norms, corporate social responsibility,","Soohyun Cho","Soohyun Cho",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bowdoin College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use a community detection algorithm to cluster cities into political communities based on elite networks and then explore the coherence of political behavior within communities as well as their divergence from sample-wide trends. Some political communities evidence distinctive governing practices. Bayesian regressions for policy choice evidence that cities take cues from peers within their networks moreso than general trends.

Missing, however, is an examination of how voters evaluate queer individuals serving in executive positions. Past research has documented the gendered pattern of cabinet appointments. In advanced democracies, women have frequently been appointed to lead ministries that oversee ""feminine"" or low-prestige policy areas. While this pattern has changed in recent years, the question remains: do queer politicians face similar barriers? In this project, we employ a conjoint survey experiment in the United Kingdom to assess how individuals evaluate queer and gender non-conforming cabinet ministers. In doing so, we examine whether queer and gender non-conforming cabinet ministers are punished by voters compared to straight and gender conforming ministers. Additionally, we assess whether voters see queer and gender non-conforming politicians as better suited to lead different ministries than their straight and gender conforming counterparts. To vary the degree to which these ministers conform to typical gender norms, we manipulate the hypothetical minister's sexual orientation, physical appearance, and hobbies. We then explore how these factors affect perceptions of the minister's deservingness and competency.","Keywords: Queer Politics, Gender and Politics, Cabinet Ministers, United Kingdom","Joseph Cozza","Joseph Cozza",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Rice University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that while Democrats and Republicans tend to focus on the same objects—giving more attention to personalized depictions of a polarizing issue, which they view more positively, and less attention to depersonalized depictions, seen as more negative—Democrats spend significantly more overall time fixating on political visuals than Republicans. This suggests that although both groups pay attention to the same visual objects, they engage differently with the broader context of these images. We further show that these differences in visual engagement mediate partisanship's effect on attitudes, revealing a yet unexplored pathway through which visual processing may contribute to attitude polarization.

"abstract_0976_1933_1189.html","The audience effect: Leaders’ speeches over decentralization in different contexts","Political party leaders have to address different scenarios, each with distinct audiences, and they need support from different groups. As their audience changes, their speeches must adapt. Their speeches are not only based on the traditional left-right scale but also on issues beyond ideological divisions, such as decentralization or devolution. These demands are greater in multilevel countries, where party leaders require support from different territorial audiences. In parliaments, the influence of MPs from high regional identity territories and how leaders manage this presence are essential for the content of their speeches. Their influence focuses on maintaining parliamentary confidence and supporting legislation approvals. Are parliamentary speeches significantly more decentralized than party conference speeches with respect to decentralization? The primary assumption is that political leaders change their speeches on decentralization depending on their audience. To predict party leaders' position on decentralization, I use results from a supervised machine-learning analysis of speeches from the United Kingdom and Spain. I distinguish between the demands placed on party leaders in parliamentary investiture speeches, focused on attracting parliamentary support, and national party conference speeches, focused more on internal divisions. I expect party leaders to take a stronger position on decentralization when addressing MPs from different regions than when presenting to intra-party audiences. These results have implications for studying political leaders' communication strategies in multilevel institutions and countries. The use of quantitative text analysis methods also contributes a novel approach to identifying policy dimensions beyond the left-right scale.","Keywords: speeches-parties-leaders-decentralization-ideology","Alberto de León","Alberto de León",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University College Dublin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0977_1451_0062.html","It’s redistribution and recognition! Welfare generosity, multiculturalism, and migrants’ perceived deservingness in Western Europe","Migrants struggle to be perceived as deserving to settle and access the welfare state. Yet, why are migrants perceived as more deserving in some Western European countries than in others? Previous research on the relationship between welfare policies and migrants' perceived deservingness has produced conflicting findings. While more generous welfare regimes are often associated with higher levels of social solidarity, this solidarity does not always extend to migrants. For instance, welfare chauvinistic attitudes and policies are prevalent even in some of the most generous welfare states, such as Denmark. In this paper, I put forward the institutional interaction hypothesis, which argues that the relationship between welfare policies and migrants' perceived deservingness depends on a third variable: a country’s approach to cultural diversity and migrant incorporation. Using European Social Survey (ESS) data from 16 Western European countries spanning from 2002–2020, along with indices on multiculturalism policies (MCP Index and IMPIC Index) and welfare generosity (Comparative Welfare Entitlement Dataset), I test this hypothesis with a series of multilevel models. The findings show that in countries with generous welfare policies, higher levels of multiculturalism policies are associated with higher levels of migrants' perceived settlement and welfare deservingness. This paper makes two key contributions: First, it advances a new framework theorizing links between institutional contexts and deservingness perceptions. Second, it contributes to debates on migration and the welfare state by showing that generous welfare policies can sustain public support for migrants' social rights when paired with inclusive approaches to ethnic diversity and migration.","Keywords: Welfare policies,  deservingness, migration, incorporation policies, policy feedback.","Paula Dümpelmann","Paula Dümpelmann",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, two major and conflicting narratives have come to light in explaining the growing appeal of populist parties: while (Inglehart and Norris, 2016) found mainly cultural reasons for the rise of populist parties, others including (Colantone and Stanig, 2018; Guiso et al., 2019) argued for a larger role of economic factors.This paper investigates the trade shock of China joining the WTO in 2001 and its impact on the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region. The trade shock in the USA and in Western Europe, led to the manufacturing sector experiencing import competition from cheaper Chinese goods, which resulted in loss of business, closures and layoff of workers. This increased resentment amongst voters, and increased support for populist politicians. However the CEE region was a beneficiary of globalisation as many of the enterprises from Western Europe relocated to this region because of lower wages.This article uses a Bartik type instrument (Autor et al., 2013) and NUTS-2 regional data, to test how voters in CEE countries responded to trade shocks. The article finds that as opposed to Western European countries, a 1% increase in imports from China decreased the support for populist parties by 2%. We explain this effect by showing how CEE countries benefited from foreign direct investment from Western European countries, which needed cheap imports from China.","Keywords: Populism, Trade shock, Central And Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe","Andras Tetenyi","Andras Tetenyi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Corvinus University of Budapest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0979_1455_1314.html","Trade, Contestation and Political Representation During England's Long 17th Century","How is political representation shaped by dramatic economic change?  This paper considers the consequences of expanding overseas trade for parliamentary representation during England's long 17th century, the period in which new trade routes between Western Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas were opened.  To date, one of the significant challenges in addressing this question has been the lack of availability of sub-national measures of overseas trade.  Using data derived from the archival Port Books, records of customs collections for overseas voyages, this paper measures port-specific annual trade over the centuries-long scale it expanded.  Paired with data on contests for parliamentary office, and the characteristics of both challengers and representatives, the paper uses a series of difference-in-differences designs to evaluate the consequences of expanding trade for competition for political power and the entry of new economic elites to Parliament.  The paper finds that trade generated little new competition for parliamentary office, even while parliamentary representation shifted towards elites involved in new trades.  Rather than compete against old economic elites, new economic elites arose directly from their ranks, capturing the benefits of trade to persist in power.  Overall the paper demonstrates how representation can be responsive to economic change, even when that change does not arise via open, adversarial competition for political office.","Keywords: Electoral competition, economic representation, elite turnover, historical political economy, international political economy","Adriane Fresh","Adriane Fresh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Duke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Older generations hold significant political influence due to higher voter turnout and their overrepresentation in political leadership, which often aligns policy priorities with their interests. This dynamic has the potential to fuel age-based prejudice between younger and older generations. Yet, while ageism is increasingly studied, its political roots remain underexplored.This study examines how political ideology, perceptions of age-based discrimination, and views on political leaders’ age influence ageist attitudes in three ageing democracies: Italy, South Korea, and the United States. We conducted nationally representative surveys (N ≈ 5,500) between December 2023 and January 2024, measuring ageism through direct survey questions and implicit attitude tests (IAT).Our findings reveal that political factors strongly predict ageism toward older people. Right-wing individuals are less prejudiced toward older generations, reflecting ideological alignment with traditional values and older voters’ interests. Conversely, individuals who feel discriminated against because of their age or perceive older politicians as ineffective are more likely to hold negative attitudes toward older people. However, ageism toward younger people shows weaker associations with these political factors, possibly due to older generations’ political dominance.By uncovering the political drivers of ageism, this study advances the understanding of intergenerational prejudice. It underscores the role of political dynamics—ideology, representation, and discrimination—in shaping ageist attitudes, with important implications for ageing democracies worldwide.","Keywords: Ageism, Intergenerational Conflict, Political Ideology, Age-Based Discrimination","Alonso Roman Amarales","Alonso Roman Amarales","Bocconi University","Scott Williamson","University of Oxford","Luca Bellodi","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi University","University of Oxford","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In line with compensatory theories that have been inspired by the wartime experience of Western countries in the 20th century, I posit that public attitudes towards redistribution follow a compensatory logic—for their sacrifice at the frontlines, ordinary citizens demand compensation from the state in the form of redistribution from the rich. Public attitudes, however, are further shaped by individual oligarchs’ wartime behavior and background characteristics. I test my theory with an original conjoint survey experiment conducted in Ukraine during Russia’s full-scale invasion. My findings show that citizens support redistribution from oligarchs who made their initial fortunes in illegal ways, but oppose redistribution from oligarchs who demonstrate prosocial behavior during wartime, for example oligarchs who were in the country at the time of war onset, who provide significant amounts of aid, and who support volunteers, soldiers, and civilians. The study aims to contribute to our understanding of public support for redistribution during wartime, public support for the superrich, and oligarch survival in the context of developing countries, all areas of research that have received little scholarly attention to date.","Keywords: attitudes, redistribution, extreme wealth, oligarchs, war","Silviya Nitsova","Silviya Nitsova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0982_1354_1401.html","The Security Externalities of Trade Agreements: Exclusion, Public Opinion, and Conflict","Trade agreements are widely perceived as promoting peace. Because of their generally discriminatory nature, however, trade agreements include certain states at the expense of others. We study how citizens’ views on security are shaped by such exclusion. Does the exclusionary behavior of third countries change the public’s perception of the likelihood of conflict between the home and these third countries? Answering this question is important when many foreign policy decisions become increasingly politicized.We expect that people express greater concern about their home countries’ security relations with a foreign country that excludes them from a trade agreement and anticipate their relations to become more conflictual. Furthermore, we distinguish between two situations: one in which the excluded country only incurs economic costs via trade diversion and one in which the third countries manage to convert the gains from trade into additional military capabilities. We expect the home country’s public to react especially negatively in the latter case. If these expectations are correct, by excluding countries, trade agreements entail significant security externalities.We test these theoretical expectations with experiments included in surveys fielded to representative samples of citizens in China and the United States. These are ideal cases for our analysis because both countries are important players in international trade and security. They are also major trade partners and rivals competing for global influence.The preliminary analysis of the data indicates support for our theoretical expectations.

Studies have shown that Latinos are vulnerable to misinformation, because they rely more heavily on social media and messaging platforms than non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, fact checking algorithms are not as robust in Spanish as they are in English, and social media platforms put far more effort into combating misinformation on English-language media than Spanish-language media, which compounds the likelihood of being exposed to misinformation. As a result, we expect that Latinos who use Spanish-language social media to be more likely to believe in false political narratives when compared to Latinos who primarily rely on English-language social media for news. To test this expectation, we fielded the largest online survey to date of social media usage and belief in political misinformation of Latinos. Our study, fielded in the months leading up to and following the 2022 midterm elections, examines a variety of false political narratives that were circulating in both Spanish and English on social media. We find that social media reliance for news predicts one's belief in false political stories, and that Latinos who use Spanish-language social media have a higher probability of believing in false political narratives, compar","Keywords: misinformation/(dis)information, social media,  news and information","Marisa Abrajano","Marisa Abrajano","University of California, San Diego","Jonathan Nagler","New York University","Joshua Tucker","New York University","Aaron Pope","Center for the Study of Social Media and Politics, NYU","Marianna Garcia","University of California, San Diego","Robert Vidigal","Center for the Study of Social Media and Politics, NYU","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Diego","New York University","Center for the Study of Social Media and Politics, NYU",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the factors explaining firms' ability to mobilize their employees. In this paper, we argue that firms possessing elevated monopsony power also exhibit a heightened capacity to mobilize their workforce, capitalizing on the constrained external opportunities available to their employees. First, we present descriptive evidence, illustrating that in firms with greater monopsony power, there exists a higher probability of political alignment between the firm and its workforce, measured through campaign donations of workers and firms. Then, we employ mergers in a difference-in-differences event study design to estimate the causal impact of monopsony power on political mobilization. We use mergers because they are commonly associated with an increase in monopsony power and they are arguably unrelated to the political preferences of their workforce. Finally, we look at policy outcomes such as members of Congress votes on relevant issues for the corporate sectors, investigating whether the political mobilization of workers in large industries in their constituencies influence their legislative decisions. In this regard, we aim to study whether headquarters of large corporations with substantial political clout in Congressional districts influence the behavior of elected representatives.","Keywords: monopsony power; political influence; corporate donations; Congress","Alberto Parmigiani","Alberto Parmigiani","LSE","Tommaso Crescioli","Bocconi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LSE","Bocconi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0985_1241_0158.html","From partisan loyalty to demographic bias: Corruption accountability in partisan and nonpartisan contexts","Voters' responses to elite malpractice, such as corruption, vary depending on partisanship and politicians’ demographic traits. While partisan loyalty often shields in-party elites from sanctions, nonpartisan contexts might shift voter biases, amplifying the influence of demographic characteristics like gender and ethnicity. This paper investigates whether nonpartisan settings improve accountability by reducing partisan bias or whether they heighten demographic biases, thereby trading one form of bias for another. Empirically, I conduct two survey experiments. The first, in Austria, uses a 2x2 design to examine how minister gender and partisanship influence voter sanctions in corruption scandals. The second, in France, Germany, Sweden, and Romania, employs a factorial experiment to evaluate how gender, ethnicity, and other traits shape voter sanctions in partisan and nonpartisan contexts. I find that voters sanction corruption scandals more severely in nonpartisan contexts, leading to more uniform accountability. While I do not find consistent evidence that women face a double standard, ethnic minority politicians consistently face harsher sanctions, particularly when evaluated as members of the out-party. These findings have significant implications for democratic representation. First, the heightened sanctions against ethnic minorities may deter them from entering politics, perpetuating inequalities in political representation. Second, contrary to the perception that nonpartisan politicians may undermine democratic representation, I demonstrate that partisan contexts pose greater challenges to the quality of democratic accountability than nonpartisan settings.","Keywords: corruption, double standard, gender, ethnic minorities, survey experiments","Jeanne Marlier","Jeanne Marlier",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0986_2380_0220.html","Seats of Hope: Can Special Peace Districts Increase Political Engagement and Institutional Trust in Postwar Democracies?","This study investigates the potential of representational transitional justice (TJ) policies to promote the political integration of conflict victims. While conventional TJ initiatives have yielded inconsistent outcomes in facilitating reconciliation and building trust, the consequences of the direct involvement of victims in formal political institutions remain unexamined. We contribute to this debate by focusing on Colombia's Special Transitory Peace Districts (CITREP), which allocated 16 extra-legislative seats for conflict victims during the 2022 elections. We evaluate the impact of this policy on participation, political efficacy, and institutional trust. CITREP's allocation to specific municipalities based on territorial contiguity and the restriction of eligibility to rural districts, enable us to discern its causal effects. We use electoral results at the polling station level, which help capture the immediate turnout response to the policy, and novel individual-level survey data collected two years after the seminal election that allows us to yield how such reactions turned into beliefs. Difference-in-differences models using polling-station data indicate that CITREP increased turnout in the inaugural CITREP elections by 5 percent. Nonetheless, our survey, conducted after several CITREP MPs became embroiled in corruption scandals with armed groups and political party machines, reveals that initial expectations related to the policy have not been fulfilled and CITREP communities currently exhibit worse opinions about the initiative and demonstrate diminished levels of political efficacy and hope regarding TJ policies. These results underscore that well-intentioned policies can produce adverse effects when expectations are unmet, emphasizing the necessity for careful oversight during implementation.","Keywords: Political participation, Representation, Transitional justice, Conflict, Colombia","Sergi Martínez","Sergi Martínez","EAFIT University","Joan Barceló","New York University Abu Dhabi","Mauricio Vela","Centro de Estudios en Democracia y Asuntos Electorales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EAFIT University","New York University Abu Dhabi","Centro de Estudios en Democracia y Asuntos Electorales",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0987_1906_0372.html","The geometry of conflict : 3D Spatio-temporal patterns in fatalities prediction","Understanding how conflict events spread over time and space is crucial for predicting and mitigating future violence. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of methods capable of capturing the intricate, dynamic patterns of conflict diffusion. The complex nature of those trends needs flexibility in the models to untangle them. This study addresses this gap by analyzing spatio-temporal conflict fatality data using an innovative approach that transforms the data into three-dimensional patterns at the PRIO-grid level. First, our research investigates pattern redundancy and identifies potentially dangerous patterns preceding conflict outbreaks. By applying the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) algorithm, we detect and classify these patterns, allowing us to compare and match patterns with high adaptive capacity in all dimensions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on individual data points, our approach examines patterns across time and space, enabling a deeper understanding of conflict dynamics. Using historical similar patterns, we generate predictions of conflict fatalities and compare these with forecasts from the VIEWS ensemble model, a leading benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that recognizing and analyzing conflict diffusion patterns significantly improves predictive accuracy, outperforming the benchmark model. This research contributes to the study of conflict dynamics by introducing a novel pattern recognition framework that enhances the analysis of spatio-temporal data and offers practical applications for early warning systems.","Keywords: Pattern, Conflict, Forecast, Spatio-temporal","Thomas SCHINCARIOL","Thomas SCHINCARIOL",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Trinity College Dublin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, protest events can sometimes backfire and deepen divisions among political groups. Notably, protest campaigns are not exclusively used by pro-democratic forces; anti-democratic groups also mobilize their supporters to strengthen their base and deliberately create societal divisions. In such cases, the resulting polarization makes it difficult to restore democratic norms, even after anti-pluralists are no longer in power. What types of protest events are more detrimental to democratic stability than others? To examine the varied effects of protest campaigns, I conducted a conjoint survey experiment in Brazil, a country where the trend of autocratization has recently reversed but remains marked by high levels of polarization. With 1,200 respondents, I evaluate how the messages and nature of protest campaigns can either exacerbate or alleviate the societal divisions created by anti-pluralist leaders. The findings enhance our understanding of the effect of autocratic mobilization on the course of autocratization and democratic stability.","Keywords: Protest Campaign, Autocratic Mobilization, Regime Change, Democratic Reversal, Political Psychology","Yuko Sato","Yuko Sato",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Democracy Institute, Central European University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To study this question, we conduct conjoint experiments embedded in an online survey with 6,000 respondents in Colombia. We present pairs of hypothetical individuals along with audios featuring voices with accents corresponding to different socio-economic groups. Respondents are also provided information about each profile’s income, education, and other attributes. We documentthe presence of an “accent premium,” whereby respondents prefer profiles with high-class accents over those with lower-class accents in everyday and work-related interactions. We further show that these effects are not driven by individuals’ income, education, or personality traits. Importantly, the accent premium is not observed when the audios feature high-class foreign accents. Additionally, we find that class-based accents have downstream effects: they increase individuals’ concerns about inequality, especially among respondents with low socioeconomic status, and lead to lower interpersonal trust. Overall, our findings suggest that accents exacerbate the barriers individuals of lower socio-economic status face, impacting their success. Our paper has broad policy implications for addressing inequality and improving citizens’ prospects for social mobility.","Keywords: Social class, discrimination, trust, segregation, inequality","Leopoldo Fergusson","Leopoldo Fergusson","Universidad de los Andes","Natalia Garbiras-Díaz","Harvard Business School","Michael Weintraub","Universidad de los Andes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de los Andes","Harvard Business School","Universidad de los Andes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_0991_2396_0656.html","Coal Rush: The Electoral Legacy of the Industrial Revolution","Historical industrial heartlands have shifted to the right over the past decades, but the sources of this electoral realignment remain difficult to ascertain. We argue that the timing and intensity of industrialization shape contemporary spatial heterogeneities in voting behavior through persistent sociodemographic sorting. To examine our argument, we study the long-term effects of coal mining in Germany's Ruhr area. We match the geolocation of 1,000 mining shafts and historical plant-level employment surveys with electoral outcomes at the neighborhood level. For identification, we exploit the varying depths of coal deposits that governed the adoption of deep-shaft mining. We show that communities that industrialized later and more intensively exhibit higher support for the radical right and social democrats today, coupled with lower turnout. These effects are driven by the consequences of intensive industrialization for neighborhood sorting and long-term economic performance: Historical mining communities are significantly poorer and more socioculturally diverse today than communities with less intensive industrialization experiences. Using rich historical census data, we demonstrate that these structural differences did not exist prior to industrialization. We also consider the role of historical migration waves into the Ruhr area, showing that greater demographic upheaval due to labor migrants from Prussia's Eastern frontier is associated with lower incomes in the present. Finally, we exploit the quasi-random settlement distribution of migrant groups with different confessional alignments to examine the second-order effects of specialization in coal mining.

Historically anchored in neoliberal principles and a bastion of openness and liberalization, economic and political shocks have led the EU to embrace a range of initiatives reflecting a transition from a market-driven liberal approach to a more assertive outlook on the world. While scholars have been investigating key policies in the geopolitical transition of the EU such as the Anti-Coercion Instrument or the Investment Screening Mechanism, we lack a comprehensive understanding of this shift beyond individual policy areas. To what extent, in which domains, and with which countries do we observe a geopoliticization in EU external economic policy? As a consequence of geopoliticization, the opening and closure of the EU’s external economic boundaries should vary with the security relevance of trade partners and policy domains. More specifically, we expect that countries that are allied with the EU and/or its member states should face lower hurdles in their trade with the EU, and even more so in security-relevant domains such as dual-use goods, FDI, energy, and critical infrastructure investments. To test our expectations on the tightening trade-security nexus in external economic policy, we rely on a novel dataset of EU economic boundary configurations to investigate the extent to which the EU’s reorientation toward assertiveness is reflected in the entry restrictions of goods, services, and investments. Dyadic regression analyses of closure across 42 functional boundaries confirm our expectation on the differential geopoliticization of EU external economic policy.","Keywords: European Union, trade policy, economic policy, geopolitics, China","Christian Freudlsperger","Christian Freudlsperger","ETH Zurich, Center for International Studies (CIS)"," Alessia Invernizzi","ETH Zurich, Center for International Studies (CIS)"," Aydin Yildirim","ETH Zurich, Center for International Studies (CIS)","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zurich, Center for International Studies (CIS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0993_1595_0829.html","Territorial Polarisation as a Barrier to the Radical Right? Scottish Exceptionalism in Comparative Context","The populist radical right has made advances and even entered government across much of Europe in recent decades. However, parties of this nature have not achieved serious electoral traction in Scotland to-date, particularly compared to other constituent countries of the United Kingdom and neighbouring small nations in northern Europe. In this paper we investigate Scotland's outlier status, arguing that it is mainly a ""supply-side"" phenomenon downstream of two national sovereignty referendums in the mid-2010s: the 2014 vote on Scottish independence and the 2016 UK-wide ballot on EU membership. These contests restructured Scottish party politics, with support for secession and Brexit cutting across many of the sociodemographic divides that fulled the rise of populist right parties elsewhere at the time. We identify a form of ""synergistic"" party system polarisation present in Scotland in the past decade, which allowed the Scottish National Party (pro-independence, anti-Brexit) and Conservatives (anti-independence, pro-Brexit) to dominate electoral politics using each other as a foil while these territorial and constitutional issues were resolved. This limited space for radical right challengers until at least the mid-2020s, but a post-pandemic decline in the salience of constitutional questions and heavy losses for both parties at the 2024 UK General Election have removed key structural barriers to populist success. We conclude that it is the Scottish political context - rather than Scottish public opinion - which is exceptional.","Keywords: populism, radical right, European politics, party system polarisation, Scotland","Fraser McMillan","Davide Vampa","University of Edinburgh"," Alan Convery","University of Edinburgh"," Fraser McMillan","University of Edinburgh","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Edinburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We focus on the influence of the World Health Organization (WHO) on medical research on infectious diseases. Using disease characteristics to explore the informativeness of the market demand, we find that diseases with unequal geographic distribution receive a higher priority from the WHO while severe diseases are not listed as a high priority, confirming that the WHO's information provision substitutes for the lack of information about the market demand. Using a difference-in-differences specification to examine the effect of WHO priority on R&D investment, we find that WHO priority may have increased R&D investment in ignored diseases but discouraged clinical trials for these diseases.","Keywords: Regulation, global health, scientific development","Zoe Ge","Zoe Ge","IE University","Mengfan Cheng","New York University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IE University","New York University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, measuring these perceptions over time, across contexts and for various types of groups, is still a methodological challenge. The media plays a pivotal role in shaping societal perceptions and constructing narratives that influence the collective understanding of social groups. This paper introduces a new project that seeks to detect specific social group mentions based on an innovative approach that leverages a multilingual supervised BERT model trained on French and German newspaper archives spanning a period from 1995 to 2023. In the first step, the model is trained to identify media mentions of social groups in general, following recent advancements in the field. In the second step, we fine-tune another model to identify mentions of specific, prominent social groups within the sentences detected in the first phase. Our measures are validated through precision and recall tests conducted on manually coded data, complemented by existing and newly collected survey data on group deservingness. Preliminary findings demonstrate the potential of this approach for tracking social constructions of various groups across time and contexts.","Keywords: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Social groups, Media, Multilingual BERT","Selma Sarenkapa","Selma Sarenkapa","CEE, Sciences Po Paris","Elisa Deiss-Helbig","University of Konstanz","Mathieu Dubied","University of Zurich","Isabelle Guinaudeau","Centre Marc Bloch","Raphael Heiberger","University of Stuttgart","Theres Matthieß","University of Göttingen","","","","","","","","","CEE, Sciences Po Paris","Centre Marc Bloch","University of Konstanz","University of Zurich","University of Göttingen","University of Stuttgart",NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a factorial survey experiment, participants evaluated fictional political candidates across four conditions: (1) First-Order Beliefs, where participants provided personal evaluations; (2) Third-Order Beliefs, where participants predicted how the general population would evaluate candidates, incentivized for accuracy; (3) Conservative Context, where participants rated candidates based on how they believed conservative voters would evaluate them; and (4) Liberal Context, where ratings were aligned with perceived liberal voter preferences, both with monetary incentives for alignment. Candidate profiles varied in gender, age, experience, education, experience, and marital status.A total of 504 participants, recruited in collaboration with the Laboratory of Experimental Economics at the University of Warsaw, completed the online study after filtering for attention checks. Preliminary findings suggest no significant gender bias when participants rated candidates based on personal beliefs or predicted general population preferences. In the conservative context, however, male candidates received slightly higher ratings, suggesting potential gender bias under ideological priming. In the liberal context, no significant gender bias was observed. Interactions between candidate gender, age, and marital status showed subtle but varying effects across conditions.These preliminary results highlight the nuanced role of contextual and belief-based factors in shaping political evaluations, particularly in ideologically charged settings.This study contributes to understanding how belief systems influence gender perceptions in politics and offers a foundation for further exploration of these dynamics.","Keywords: gender representation, experimental design, factorial survey, first-order beliefs, third-order beliefs, political ideology","Agata Andrysiak","Agata Andrysiak",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_0997_0971_1131.html","No leave, no office. How parental leave frameworks for councillors contribute to women’s representation in politics.","Although women make up half of the general population, they remain underrepresented in political offices. Existing research points to the crucial role of political institutions, such as gender quotas, in fostering women’s political representation. These instruments assume that equal opportunities in candidate selection are key to encouraging women to run for office. However, women’s decisions to enter politics also hinge on factors like time constraints, which may arise from caregiving responsibilities. In this regard, motherhood could restrain women’s political aspirations. Yet, it remains unclear whether institutions could mitigate this effect. In this context, this article examines how parental leave frameworks for politicians affect women’s willingness to run for political office.The article is grounded in two key assumptions. First, women are more likely to pursue political careers if they feel confident that their professional ambitions can align with family planning. Second, frameworks that allow politicians to be temporarily replaced during parenthood can reduce discrimination against women in the candidate selection process. Since most countries do not offer parental leave for elected officials at the national level, this study focuses on variations in parental leave provisions for local councillors in the United Kingdom. Using a difference-in-differences approach, the article analyses data on candidates who ran for office before and after the introduction of parental leave policies at the local level. By doing so, it deepens our understanding of how socio-political institutions influence gender representation.","Keywords: gender, participation, institutions, causal inference","Mirko Wegemann","Mirko Wegemann",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Münster",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Role of Media Narratives of Digital Election Interference on Political and Perceived Polarisation","How does the public discourse of digital election interference affect political polarisation? This study investigates this question using a survey experiment conducted in the UK in 2024. Respondents were exposed to fictitious news stories about digital interference during the 2019 general election, and the treatment varied information about which party benefitted from the interference. Attitudes were subsequently measured across ideological, affective, and perceived polarisation. The results indicate that news reports about this form of digital election interference do not significantly increase society's aggregated level of polarisation. However, when respondents believed the opposing party benefited, they reported heightened levels of perceived societal division and affective polarisation against the opposing ‘political wing’, suggesting that there are important ‘winner-loser’ dynamics to consider.Since one key aim of interference campaigns often is to amplify polarisation, this indicates that way media reports on these events may inadvertently play a role in helping these campaigns achieve their objectives. This suggests that media actors carry some responsibility when it comes to their rhetoric around digital election interference. This entails balancing the the need to inform the public about important political events while at the same time avoiding exaggerated alarmism. These results underscore that while the direct impact of such campaigns on voter opinions and behaviour remains uncertain, the discourse surrounding them has the potential to shape democratic attitudes and influence societal cohesion in and by itself.","Keywords: digital election interference, political polarisation, bots and trolls, survey experiment, political attitudes, media effects, political communication","Emelie Karlsson","Emelie Karlsson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Uppsala University, Department of Government",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper investigates how autocrats use science rhetoric in speeches and how it affects science policy outcomes during their tenure. While research has focused on the politicization of scientific issues like climate change and vaccination in liberal democracies, this work examines the oft-neglected intersection of political communication and policy outcomes in non-democracies. It explores how politicized science discourse impacts funding for higher education and research and development, analyzing data from 55 leaders across 33 countries from 1990 to 2023. The paper makes three key contributions. First, it develops a conceptual framework for science rhetoric, distinguishing between normative and institutional aspects of political language. Second, it introduces a novel method using natural language processing to detect these dimensions of rhetoric through contextual semantic similarity. Third, it assesses the relationship between rhetoric and policy outcomes in regression models. Early results show significant variation in normative and institutional rhetoric among authoritarian leaders both within and across countries. Autocrats using more institutional rhetoric tend to allocate more funding to higher education and R&D, in contrast to those relying on normative rhetoric. Institutional constraints mediate the relationship between rhetoric and policy outcomes, with more constrained leaders showing stronger alignment between rhetoric and action. These findings highlight the stakes of scientific discourse as a battleground for both open inquiry and political manipulation, with implications for global challenges like climate change and public health.","Keywords: Political Communication, Politicization of Science, Science and Technology Policy, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models","Sukayna Younger-Khan","Sukayna Younger-Khan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of KonstanzCluster of Excellence Politics of Inequality",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, whether such evidence-based rhetoric is perceived as more credible is still unclear. Using original survey experiments, this paper explores this important question by focusing on two factors: the type of evidence and issue characteristics. First, I differentiate between ""primary"" and ""secondary"" evidence appeals. Primary evidence refers to one's own professional expertise or educational background, whereas secondary evidence refers to relying on external expert advice, research findings, or statistics. Building on ""epistemic authority"" framework, I expect that experiential, primary evidence appeals are more persuasive compared to external, secondary evidence. Second, I differentiate between valence and positional issues. While valence issues are characterized by a consensus on the desired outcome, positional issues include polarized preferences, increasing the chances for perceptual biases leading to the rejection of evidence. These hypotheses will be tested using original survey experiments in 5 European countries.","Keywords: party rhetoric, evidence-based, party strategies, voter perceptions","Mohamed Nasr","Mohamed Nasr",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We define segmentation as the extent to which parties share a common electorate and measure it using a novel ecological inference algorithm that estimates vote transfer probabilities at the district level. We hypothesize that traditional parties responded differently to increased competition from new mass parties based on market segmentation: highly segmented markets led to rule changes, while less segmented markets encouraged voter coordination. Updating the Rokkan-Boix hypothesis on the origins of proportional representation, we introduce a flexible framework centered on vote transfers shaped by deeper societal cleavages. Additionally, we quantify the electoral trade-offs constraining left- and right-wing parties in coordinating their electorates, showing that high trade-offs often precipitated reform. Using district-level data from Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, we find strong evidence supporting our hypothesis.","Keywords: Proportional representation, history

"abstract_1002_1820_1393.html","Different priorities, different phrasing: Exploring gender differences in open-text responses to the ‘most important issue’ question.","Issue preferences - and crucially priorities - are central to voting behaviour. To understand issue priorities, researchers often rely on the 'most important issue' (MII) question in political surveys, analysing voters’ issue priorities on aggregate and by different demographic groupings. Prior studies have used variations in responses to the MII question to explore gender gaps in issue salience and position and their relationship with voting behaviour (Campbell, 2012, Yildirim, 2022). However, the current measurement of MII questions presents limitations in capturing nuanced insights into the issue priorities of women and men. Firstly, MII categories are often broadly conceived, encompassing a variety of diverse and specific concerns into singular, overarching issue domains. Consequently, if men and women prioritise different aspects of the same broader issue, these differences are obscured. Secondly, standard coding of MII categories typically lacks measurement of issue position, potentially conflating vastly different voter attitudes towards an issue within a single category. This paper addresses these methodological limitations by employing quantitative computational text analysis techniques to a large corpus of open-text responses to the MII question. Our data sources include the British Election Study Internet Panel (2014-2024), British Election Study Face to Face Post-Election Surveys (2015, 2017, 2019, and 2024), and European Election Study (2019).

Through nationally-representative surveys of US and Germany residents, administered through YouGov in August 2022 and October/November 2024, we gather data on the frequency and intensity of individuals’ usage of a wide range of print, television, radio, and online news sources, as well as information on the identity and partisanship of the individuals with whom respondents discuss politics. Using these data, we test the hypothesis that individuals who consume more conservative media are more likely to view inflation and unemployment as serious problems and more likely to be pessimistic about the current and future direction of the economy. We also test the degree to which individuals’ political talking networks and partisan differences between respondents and their talking partners shape their views about these economic outcomes. Finally, through experimental treatments embedded in our surveys, we explore the degree to which providing partisan cues and global context about the state of the US/German economy shapes individuals’ views of inflation, unemployment, and recessions. Our analysis strongly suggests that the “information economy” in which individuals participate plays a crucial role in shaping their attitudes about the state of the real economy.","Keywords: Inflation, public opinion, political economy, media, unemployment","Mark Copelovitch, Michael Wagner","Mark Copelovitch","University of Wisconsin - Madison"," Michael Wagner","University of Wisconsin - Madison","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Wisconsin - Madison",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1004_1899_1403.html","Minority Multidimensionality: Perceived Political Minority Status & (Un)Deservingness of Protection","The protection of minority rights is a fundamental normative and democratic principle. Yet, its disregard persists in various forms of discrimination, global conflict and socio-political disparity—even in advanced democracies. The bulk of scholarly investigation into the matter has focused on top-down processes related to the development and implementation of laws and policies aimed at protecting minority rights, leaving the bottom-up processes related to citizens' support for such laws and policies relatively underexplored. This is likely due to the fact that existing data suggest that citizens’ support for minority rights is rather high and stable—leaving little to investigate. However, I argue that existing measures of support for protecting minority rights suffer from two important shortcomings: minorities are often discussed in abstract terms and support for protecting their rights is often gauged in unconstrained ways. To address these oversights, this paper empirically investigates which specific characteristics influence citizens’ consideration of political minority status using a customized conjoint and perceived deservingness of protection by leveraging a trade-off framing. The results—based on surveys fielded in France, Hungary, Belgium and Switzerland—reveal that political minority status is readily recognized on the basis of numerical considerations, as well as considerations of social dominance/subordinance. However, citizens appear to be mostly unwilling to protect the rights of these political minorities—even when multiple characteristics compound their minority status. These findings reveal that—when pressed—citizens’ commitment to liberal principles of democracy might be more fickle than previously believed.","Keywords: Public opinion, political attitudes, democratic support, democratic norms and principles, revealed preferences","Damjan Tomic","Damjan Tomic",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Autonomous University of Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1005_1266_1407.html","Rising Prices, Blame-Shifting, and Credit-Claiming: Evidence from Turkey","Conventional wisdom suggests economic turmoil harms incumbents as people attribute responsibility for poor performance. Recently, rising inflation—a highly salient and widely felt economic issue—has dominated global political debates. However, public opinions on inflation’s causes and solutions vary due to its complexity. Incumbent governments often attempt to deflect blame onto misfortunes (e.g., natural disasters or international price shocks) or “bad” actors (e.g., political opponents) while taking credit for popular distributive policies or unexpected good news (e.g., such as discoveries of lucrative natural resources). Despite inflation’s prominence in recent elections, little is known about the effectiveness of such blame-shifting and credit-claiming strategies. To explore this, we analyze incumbent rhetoric on inflation, identify popular attributions of responsibility using survey data, and test the effects of rhetorical frames through an original survey experiment. Our study focuses on Turkey—a populist-led electoral autocracy with two decades of incumbency and high inflation levels. Turkey’s polarized electorate and economic volatility present a hard test for rhetorical interventions, yet the findings highlight how incumbents can shape economic responsibility attribution and policy evaluations. We find that exposure to blame-shifting frames reduces the extent to which individuals assign full responsibility for inflation to the government, particularly when external factors are emphasized. While these frames have weaker effects on evaluations of government policy effectiveness, the credit-claiming frames highlighting redistributive policies modestly improve perceptions of policy effectiveness. This study advances our understanding of mass opinion on inflation and elite strategies in economically turbulent contexts.","Keywords: inflation, blame avoidance, public opinion, electoral autocracies, economic crises","Busra Soylemez-Karakoc","Busra Soylemez-Karakoc","Koc University","Stephen Nelson","Northwestern University","Andres Schelp","Northwestern University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Koc University","Northwestern University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1006_2420_1501.html","Does Access Mean Success? Connection to Policy-Makers and Lobbying Success of Political Actors","This article investigates the relationship between access to policymakers and lobbying success. I collect unique, large-scale textual data to capture the content of lobbying activities and subsequent changes in EU regulations. I identify lobbying success with both plagiarism detection and a large language model (GPT-4). I measure direct access to policymakers based on meetings between policy-makers and interest group representatives. To address potential endogeneity in access, I build a matched sample using propensity scores and a balanced sample using Mahalanobis distance. I find that access to policymakers is associated with a larger likelihood of lobbying success, consistent across success measures and samples. This effect is stronger for organizations that hold more meetings and for those with access to higher-level officials. Finally, I exploit turnover in policymakers across mandates to explore the underlying mechanisms and find evidence that political connections primarily drive the effect of access on success, surpassing the influence of information transmission, institutional knowledge, or intrinsic quality of the organization in driving lobbying success.","Keywords: Lobbying, Interest groups, Access to policymakers","Rosanne Logeart","Rosanne Logeart",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Copenhagen Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1007_1531_1570.html","Economic voting and long-term political socialization in Latin America","The general theory of economic voting posits that voters reward or punish the incumbent government depending on the performance of the national economy. An almost infinite number of empirical studies support this proposition across different time periods and world regions. Two lines of research have gained traction in recent years. The first explores how individual-level characteristics such as political knowledge and contextual-level factors including political institutions moderate the effect of economic conditions on incumbent support. The second analyses how voters adopt different international or historical reference points to gauge relative economic performance. The present paper combines insights from these two strands with theories of political socialization. It argues that economic crises in the years of political socialization shift voters' reference points to assess current economic performance and thus change how they respond to economic circumstances during election years. I test this argument by combining individual-level data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) with macro-economic performance data and comparative data on economic crises (e.g. banking crisis, sovereign debt default) from the Behavioral Finance and Financial Stability (BFFS) project. Latin America, with its various economic crises from the 1980s onward, seems well suited to test this argument. The empirical results partly corroborate the argument and indicate that economic crises during political socialization moderate the effect of current economic performance on incumbent support. These results have important implications for explaining voting behavior and the impact of economic conditions on political representation.","Keywords: Economic voting, political socialization, economic crises, Latin America","Alejandro Ecker","Alejandro Ecker",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Heidelberg University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An analysis of public attitudes on immigrants","This study examines the impact of terrorist attacks on public attitudes toward immigration in European countries and Turkey, focusing on differences in Islamic terrorism and direct / indirect effects. Using Eurobarometer survey data from 1990 to 2018, combined with the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), the research analyzes how the occurrence, magnitude, and type of terrorist attacks influence public perceptions of immigrants over time. The study applies group threat theory to understand how fear and prejudice are shaped by factors such as religiosity, political affiliation, and demographic characteristics. Results indicate that Islamic terrorist attacks, due to their association with radical Islamist ideologies, elicit stronger anti-immigrant sentiments compared to non-Islamic attacks. Additionally, larger-scale attacks with higher casualties intensify negative attitudes, particularly among individuals with low religious commitment and conservative political affiliations.","Keywords: Terrorism, immigration, public attitudes, Islamic terrorism","Jana El Amine","Jana El Amine","ESPOL Doctoral Student","Raul Magni Berton","ESPOL Professor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ESPOL Doctoral Student","ESPOL Professor",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1009_2325_0582.html","Does Internal Migration Increase Democratic Resilience to Economic Shocks?","This paper investigates an under-explored source of democratic resilience: emigration out of economically-depressed areas. Support for anti-democratic parties concentrates in adversely-shocked regions where a reduced supply of jobs no longer supports local populations. I argue that emigration moderates the adverse political effects of local economic shocks by ameliorating competition for remaining jobs. I create a county-level dataset on the annual migration of US tax filers from the Internal Revenue Service. I show that emigration significantly moderated the adverse local effects of the NAFTA trade shock on vote shares for two populist US presidential candidates: Ross Perot and Donald Trump. The regions that the shock pushed toward Perot also swung towards Trump twenty years later; however, this persistent backlash quickly dissipated in high-emigration regions. Consistent with the job-competition mechanism, high-mobility areas rapidly recovered from the shock in terms of wages and unemployment compared to low-mobility areas. Finally, I demonstrate that mobility is a stable characteristic of regions, with high homeownership costs and affordability as the driving force behind voters' decision to remain in trade-shocked areas. These findings place internal migration and housing at the center of debates over democratic resilience to economic shocks.","Keywords: Democratic resilience, populist voting, trade politics, internal migration.","Thomas Flaherty","Thomas Flaherty",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Texas A&M University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1010_1887_0763.html","The effect of policisation on policy disagreement between the European Parliament and the Commission","The legislative institutions of the EU are subject to different pressures, which may modulate their public responsiveness and lead to inter-institutional conflict. While the directly elected European Parliament is empowered by the EU Treaties to represent the interests of the citizens across the Union, the Commission's legislative agenda may favour some interests at the expense of others, which is more likely when the public is divided or diverse interests are mobilised to influence policy. Under these conditions, we expect the EP to alter the Commission's proposals more to align it with the demands of the public. Conversely, higher public salience of policy across EU citizens should incentivise both institutions to respond to average public demands, which should be reflected in higher Commission-EP policy agreement. We expect these effects to be especially pronounced for proposals that enhance EU authority, which are more likely to come under public scrutiny. We use the Decision-Making in the EU (DEU) datasets to test these hypotheses for legislative proposals considered during the last three legislative terms (2009-2024). Eurobarometer surveys and the EU Transparency Register serve to measure, respectively, public opinion and actor mobilization over years and policy domains. We further supplement these data with the estimates of EU authority expansion within legislative proposals, obtained using semi-supervised machine learning. The results contribute to our understanding of how democratic representation affects the interactions between EU institutions in shaping EU legislation in the context of politicisation.","Keywords: European Parliament, European Commission,  DEU, Public opinion, legitimacy & representativeness","Nikoleta Yordanova, Anastasia Ershova","Nikoleta Yordanova","Leiden University","Anastasia Ershova","Queen's University Belfast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queen's University Belfast","Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1011_2645_0901.html","Fighting fire with fire: The China challenge in digital standard-setting (panel ID: INTREG)","In their work on power in private forms of global governance, Büthe and Mattli (2011) argue that “institutional complementarity”—the degree of fit between national and international institutions—is a central factor; actors whose national institutions are more closely aligned with international organizations are best able to promote their preferred rules. For rising powers, this logic of institutional complementarity constitutes a powerful incentive to align domestic rule-making with international institutions. Based on document analysis, interviews and original survey data, this paper explores the complex institutional dynamics of the emergence of Chinese actors as leading players in the setting of digital standards. Chinese actors have sought to take a step closer to international norms through a series of domestic reforms that aim to expand the role of market forces while also retaining a strong guiding role for the state. At the same time, public authorities in Europe and the US argue that is necessary for the state to become more active in standardization processes in order to protect digital standard-setting processes from being captured by China. In effect, the logic of institutional complementarity appears, paradoxically, to be pushing international institutions closer to China’s model of standardization. In this paper, we analyze the complex emerging dynamics of institutional adaptation in global digital standard-setting.","Keywords: international standardization; regulation; China","Sarah Eaton, Daniel Fuchs","Sarah Eaton","Humboldt University Berlin"," Daniel Fuchs","Humboldt University Berlin","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt University Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1012_1811_0974.html","How to build a corpus out of an “infinite” universe of “long” texts?","The rise in the use of large text data has brought to the fore discussions on how to construct an adequate corpus from vast text universes. Two main computational approaches are widely used: keyword-based search and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based methods. This paper aims to (1) propose guidelines for selecting between these approaches based on text universe characteristics and (2) introduce a novel method for building corpora from universes which do not fit either of the two prevailing approaches. We distinguish text universes by two aspects: (1) their degree of ""finity"" and (2) the length of their text units. We suggest that LDA is an appropriate method for corpus building when a universe is ""finite"", that is when it includes a defined amount of sources (e.g. central bank statements). However, LDA is impractical for ""infinite"" universes with undefined sources (e.g. Tweets) due to financial costs and computational limitations, making keyword searches more suitable. Yet when text units are lengthy or of variable length (e.g., newspaper articles), keyword searches alone fall short, as keyword presence themselves often fails to ensure relevance.To address this, we propose a hybrid method for constructing corpora from relatively infinite universes with diverse text lengths. This two-stage process involves (1) creating an initial corpus with computer-assisted keyword search and (2) applying LDA to categorize and filter texts by relevance. Using a newspaper corpus on fiscal and monetary policy from NexisUni, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness in terms of recall, precision, and practicality.","Keywords: Infinite Universe, Corpus Building, NexisUni","Barak Zur","Yuval Hirshorn","Tel Aviv University"," Ronen Mandelkern","Tel Aviv University"," Barak Zur","Tel Aviv University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Tel Aviv University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1013_2575_1035.html","Gender, Revolving Doors, and Voter Tolerance of Corruption","Little attention has been paid to how the gender of political candidates affects vote choice when candidates have connections with corrupt firms, a primary pathway through which money – and corrupt transactions – are linked to candidates pursuing political office. This paper examines the effect of gender on voter perceptions of political candidates with ties to corrupt firms. We depart from assumptions that voters perceive women as inherently more honest than men and as outsiders to corrupt networks. We test these assumptions using a conjoint survey experiment in Brazil in 2021. Contrary to widespread expectations, we find that voters, regardless of their gender, prefer female over male mayoral candidates even when both are connected to corrupt firms. This preference for female candidates varies based on female representation in politics. Voters in municipalities with higher female political representation express lower support for female candidates relative to municipalities with no female representation. Our paper demonstrates the persistence of essentialist perceptions of women as more honest, even when they are business candidates connected to corrupt firms. It also highlights that actual experiences with women in political decision-making can influence voter perceptions of female candidates linked to corruption.","Keywords: Gender, Corruption, Business candidates, Revolving door, Brazil, Survey experiments","Sina Smid","Sina Smid","Uppsala University","Amy Alexander","Gothenburg University","Mogens Justesen","Copenhagen Business School","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Uppsala University","Gothenburg University","Copenhagen Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1014_1567_1579.html","Self-interest, sociotropy and social policy","Political scientists have long debated self-interest, much research investigating whether voter motivations are self-interested or sociotropic, i.e. sympathetic to certain groups. However, there have been few studies of self-interest and sociotropy and social policy motivations.In our paper, we conduct two survey experiments with British samples which attempt to establish the conditions in which self-interested and sociotropic motivations are important in social policy. A first experiment concerns a pensions reform which offers a means-tested supplement at different income levels. A second experiment uses a conjoint design and concerns a cost-of-living payment which is targeted at different occupations and varies income eligibility and payment levels.  Voters are indeed self-interested, yet sociotropic motivations are more nuanced. In experiment one, respondents tend to have higher sociotropic motivation when the pension reform benefits a wider section of the population. There is notable ideological heterogeneity, social conservatives being disproportionately opposed to the reform which only benefits those with the lowest incomes.But in experiment two and contrary to our pre-registered hypotheses, respondents tend to have higher sociotropic motivation when the cost-of-living payment only benefits a lower-paid section of the target group. There is limited ideological heterogeneity, the self-defined motivations of ‘deservingness’ and ‘hardworkingness’ being more salient and cutting across ideological sub-groups. We conclude that different sociotropic motivations may reflect the targets of the measures. When the target is broad, voters have broader sociotropic motivation. When the target is narrow, voters have narrower sociotropic motivations.","Keywords: Social policy, self-interest, sociotropy, pensions, cost-of-living","Thomas Prosser","Thomas Prosser","Cardiff University","Jac Larner","Cardiff University","Alejandro Fernández-Roldán Díaz","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cardiff University","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, selective exposure to partisan news has been associated with higher levels of affective and ideological polarization. Most studies focus on the US, a country with a strong partisan media system and a bipartisan political system, facilitating both, the rise in selective exposure and increasing polarization. In this paper, we investigate how selective news exposure influences affective and ideological polarization in Switzerland, a multiparty system with high levels of polarization but a less partisan media landscape. Combining survey measures of news consumption with web-tracking data and Google search history data from two two-wave panel surveys, we show that selective exposure not only impacts the levels of affective polarization during political campaigns but leads to more polarized voting behavior. In doing so, this study sheds light on the complex and relationship between media consumption and current political divides.","Keywords: selective exposure, polarization, panel-data, web-tracking","Nathalie Giger","Nathalie Giger","University of Geneva","Maxime Walder","University of Geneva","Denise Traber","University of Basel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Geneva","University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1016_2095_0064.html","How Snap Election Calls Shape Vote Intention Uncertainty: Lessons From Germany, Spain, and the UK","Snap elections, often triggered by government dissolutions or leadership resignations, increase political uncertainty and disrupt voters’ decision-making processes. In this paper we investigate how such heightened political uncertainty necessarily leads to an increase in uncertainty for voting estimates through a rise in the share of “don’t know” answers and item nonresponse in vote intention questions. We also examine the durability of such phenomenon.We analyze cases from Germany, Spain, and the UK – representing diverse political systems and different timings of snap election calls. Using individual-level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study, the Spanish Political Attitudes Panel and the British Election Study we causally identify a significant increase in “don’t know” responses and item nonresponse in vote intention questions following snap election announcements. To test the robustness of these findings and also to shed light on the durability of the observed effects, we employ an unexpected events during survey design (UESD) approach based on country-specific cross-sectional data fielded around each snap election call. The rapid convergence of uncertainty levels of voting estimates to pre-event baselines underscores the transient nature of this effect. The consistency of findings across countries may well highlight the systematic nature of the observed effects.These results have methodological implications, highlighting the need to account for temporary estimation uncertainty following disruptive political events. Politically, our results emphasize that while snap election calls do introduce higher uncertainty to decision-makingvote-choice formation processes, voters’ adaptability is high enough for this effect to diminish by election day.","Keywords: snap elections, estimation uncertainty, vote intentions, panel design, unexpected events during survey design","Klara Müller","Klara Müller","University of Mannheim","Alejandro Fernández-Roldán Díaz","National University of Distance Education and University Carlos III Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Mannheim","National University of Distance Education and University Carlos III Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1017_2235_1526.html","The Political Impact of Job Destruction Announcements: Evidence from the United Kingdom","Recent work in political science and economics emphasizes the impact of economic shocks on voting behavior, particularly the rise of populist radical right parties. However, while many studies have used rigorous research designs to establish credible causal relationships, they often overlook how the effects of economic shocks evolve over time. The literature generally captures a static relationship between economic shocks and political outcomes without accounting for potential variation in effects from the immediate aftermath to the longer term. This limits our understanding of the substantive meaning of these effects and the role of time in shaping how shocks influence political behavior. This study offers a novel contribution by theorizing and empirically testing how the effects of contextual economic shocks differ in their immediate aftermath versus the long term. Using the 2014–2020 British Election Study panel data, local job destruction announcements, and two empirical designs (Unexpected-Events-During-Survey-Design and staggered difference-in-differences), we demonstrate that economic factors dominate shortly after a shock, but over time, cultural concerns, particularly around immigration, gain prominence. We explore which political actors benefit from economic shocks, integrating both demand- and supply-side factors, and highlight how radical populist parties may struggle initially but gain traction as political competition shifts from economic to cultural issues.","Keywords: Economic shocks, Populist support, Voting behavior, UK","Costin Ciobanu","Costin Ciobanu","Aarhus University","Riccardo Di Leo","European University Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1018_1973_1311.html","The Anti-Cooptational Coalition: Introducing Proportional Representation in Two-Round Systems","Why did countries with two-round systems (TRS) switch to proportional representation (PR) in early 20th century Europe? One of the major criticisms to the traditional ‘left threat’ account, which points to PR as a means for elites to contain the rise of challenger parties, like the Socialists, is that TRS already allowed bourgeois parties to lend each other votes to fend off challengers. We argue that, in these contexts, PR was not introduced to prevent a potential failure of elite coordination, but to prevent elite cooptation of challenger parties and their voters. In fact, TRS rewarded disproportionately those incumbents who were willing to coopt parts of the challenger's agenda and electoral base. This centripetal bias of TRS generates a peculiar pro-PR coalition, comprising both conservative elites unwilling to engage in cooptation and the challenger parties themselves. The theory was developed in an abductive process, shifting between two case studies and a formalised model. We assess the observable implications of the theory based on France and Italy, both countries that abandoned TRS in 1919. Our analysis of primary sources from electoral reform advocacy literature, parliamentary proceedings and party publications supports that anti-cooptational rationales for PR adoption strongly informed actors' alignment and understanding of electoral reform.  We conclude by assessing the external validity of the theory.","Keywords: Electoral Systems, Comparative Historical Analysis, Electoral Reform, Proportional Representation, Italy, France","Leonardo Carella","Leonardo Carella","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Klaudia Wegschaider","Yale University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 2024, Austrian millionaire heiress Marlene Engelhorn launched 'The Good Council for Redistribution', a private deliberative mini-public tasked with redistributing her €25 million inheritance to address wealth inequality. We conducted a field experiment around this event to study whether participation empowered council members to become informed advocates for progressive taxation. From 10,000 randomly invited Austrian residents, 50 individuals who expressed interest were selected as council members. We compare these members to both a control group of interested non-participants and a representative sample of Austrian residents. Council members and the control group completed three survey waves (baseline at the selection stage, pre-treatment, post-treatment), while the population sample provides post-treatment benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while participation increased knowledge and facilitated consensus on wealth tax design, it did not boost political efficacy or inspire greater political engagement. The strong pre-existing egalitarian attitudes among participants limited the potential for significant attitudinal change. These results underscore the challenges of privately organised deliberative initiatives in fostering diverse perspectives and sustained political mobilisation.","Keywords: Deliberative Mini-Publics, Political Participation, Political Efficacy, Redistributive Attitudes, Field Experiment","Franziska Windisch","Franziska Disslbacher","Vienna University of Economics and Business","Martin Haselmayer","University of Vienna","Severin Rapp","City University of New York","Lukas Lehner","University of Edinburgh","Franziska Windisch","University of Vienna","","","","","","","","","","","University of Vienna","University of Edinburgh","Vienna University of Economics and Business","City University of New York",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study employs local-level data on casualties from open sources collected by independent journalists and volunteers. We employ advanced difference-in-difference analyses to assess the relationships between exposure to casualties and electoral support.In a pre-registered survey experiment built into the 2024 Russian Election Study of about 1600 adult individuals, we randomize exposure to an indirect benchmark of casualties in large-scale conflicts. This vignette experiment provides all respondents with short pieces of information about the current Russo-Ukrainian war. While all respondents receive information that the number of Russian soldiers in Ukraine is very close to the number of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, we are randomly assigning some respondents to receive additional information about casualties from the Soviet-Afghan War. By providing an indirect reference, the experiment is designed to elicit the effect of exposure to casualty information on support for the incumbent. The survey is currently in the field, as of December 2024. Together with the observational data analysis, the survey experiment will provide a more robust and internally valid assessment of casualty sensitivity.

This paper explores how firms and interest association adapt their communication strategies to the affordances of social media platforms. While prior studies have focused on a limited range of platforms and predominantly Western contexts, our study expands the scope by examining interest groups’ use of a broad range of platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn and emerging networks like BlueSky and incorporate cases from both Western and Global South contexts.Using large language models and image classification tools, we analyse how different platform affordances shape the textual and visual content strategies employed by these groups. We argue that because different platforms provide unique affordances and cater to distinct audiences, the content generated by interest groups varies significantly. For example, platforms that enable longer posts and offer closed spaces for members or followers are more likely to be utilised for organizational maintenance, whereas visually driven platforms are more often leveraged for political messaging.Our findings reveal significant variation in how interest groups communicate across platforms, shaped by platform-specific affordances and audience compositions. By examining these variations, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the strategic communication practices of interest groups and the evolving dynamics of digital public spheres.","Keywords: Social-media,

Institutions, Traumas, and the Pro-American Conservative Legacy in US-Bombed Japanese Cities (1942–2000)","Historical memory and institutional legacies shape political behavior over the long term. However, in some cases, traumatic memory appears to have limited influence on politics, prompting the need to understand what factors play a decisive role under what conditions. In Japan, heavily bombed areas like Hiroshima and Eastern Tokyo preserved their wartime memories through civic education and oral histories, yet exhibited pro-American conservative voting patterns, contrasting with spared regions such as Kyoto and Sapporo.To explore this, I digitized all plants listed in the 1942 army and navy procurement records and constructed an instrumental variable based on routes between major bombing targets and U.S. air bases in Saipan or Iwo Jima. Areas on these routes were more likely to be bombed, even without military industry, as American bombers often dropped residual bombs on secondary targets on the returning journey.My IV analysis reveals that bombed areas showed increased support for purged conservative candidates in the 1952 election, establishing a legacy that persisted into modern elections. This conservative bias, absent in 1942, appears linked to wartime bombing. The pattern was especially pronounced in regions with low-casualty local infantry regiments, whereas spared cities with high-casualty regiments tended to adopt progressive tendencies.Through case studies, I argue that in bombed areas where demobilized soldiers led postwar reconstruction, conservative institutions established during this critical juncture diminished the impact of traumatic memories on political behavior. The leadership—whether by soldiers or civilians—during institution-building may shape the extent to which war memories influence politics, if at all.","Keywords: Persistence, Voting Behavior, Post-conflict Politics","Makoto Fukumoto","Makoto Fukumoto",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Waseda University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1023_1382_1555.html","Who is responsible?: A Model for Inference over Narrative Structure in Political Speech","Political scientists have long viewed the construction of narratives as one of the main tools available to political entrepreneurs to alter individual perceptions and behavior. Despite an explosion of interest in automated text analysis methods, however, no agreed-upon approach for principled empirical measurement and comparison of actual narratives exists. Indeed, widely-used unsupervised methods for the representation of text typically begin by discarding information such as event ordering and actor-actor relations that are fundamental to the concept of a narrative. This problem becomes particularly acute when scholars seek to draw parallels between elite and mass speech, such as open-ended survey responses, where differences in style tend to wash out similarities in meaning.In this paper, I introduce a new method that overcomes these difficulties, providing a general approach for the discovery and representation of narratives that facilitates comparison across multiple textual domains. Beginning from a representation of text as subject-object relations, I estimate a latent network model that classifies entities into latent narrative roles. I demonstrate the value of this approach through three empirical applications, showing that (i) it is able to accurately recover well-recognized divergent patterns of partisan speech in the US context, (ii), it uncovers meaningful shifts in narrative content after an episode of censorship in Russia that are not discoverable via topic modelling, and (iii) it provides a valid means of assessing the closeness of survey respondents to different elite narratives in low-resource Caucasian languages.","Keywords: Latent variable models, network analysis, narrative analysis, survey methodology","Perry Carter","Perry Carter",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1024_0981_0067.html","POLINF Information, Party Politics, and Public Support for Central Bank Independence","Threats to the independence of central banks (CBI) are emerging in many countries after central banks have hiked interest rates. While existing literature has extensively documented conflicts between elected politicians and independent central bankers, underscoring the importance of maintaining the political independence of central banks, we know surprisingly little about what (if anything) the public thinks about CBI. We hypothesize that support for CBI is influenced by citizens’ limited understanding of central bank governance and their beliefs about who will gain control over monetary policy if independence is reduced. We expect that, when informed that the President would gain more influence, respondents’ support for CBI will increase. Further, we argue that support for CBI hinges on which party holds the presidency. When a co-partisan (out-partisan) is President, respondents should favor reduced (increased) independence. Our expectations are confirmed by a preregistered survey experiment and a pre-post-election test. Informing respondents that the Presidency will gain influence if CBI is reduced and, in separate tests, altering expectations of co-partisan presidential election victory alter attitudes on CBI. Further, attitudes toward CBI shift post-election conditional on partisanship. From a policy perspective, our findings indicate that CBI has an important institutional function as a check-and-balance on government power, safeguarding price and macro-financial stability during intense political disagreement along partisanship lines.","Keywords: central bank independence, Federal Reserve, partisanship, experiments","Matthew DiGiuseppe","Matthew DiGiuseppe","Leiden University","Carolina Garriga","University of Essex","Andreas Kern","Georgetown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leiden University","University of Essex","Georgetown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is especially true in low-income democracies, where concerns about malpractice are heightened and electoral commissions less-resourced. But while there has been significant scholarly focus on ways to reduce objective election irregularities, we know less about voters’ faith that results are genuine and accurate. In this study we focus on an under appreciated determinant of voter confidence: the ways in which polling stations are organised and arranged on election day. Leveraging a conjoint choice experiment in Malawi, we find that voters prioritise the capacity and autonomy of polling station staff, including their training and compliance with transparency measures, and the presence of third-party actors, such as election monitors and security personnel. Contrary to theories of ethnic or partisan bias, we find that voters prefer representatives from all parties to be present in the station, while co-ethnicity or co-partisanship with the presiding officer has only limited effects on trust. These findings contribute to ongoing policy debates for election administration in low-income democracies, and to the literature on electoral integrity, public opinion, and democratic development.","Keywords: Election integrity; public opinion; Africa; experiment","Alex Yeandle","Alex Yeandle","London School of Economics"," Johan Ahlback","London School of Economics","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is particularly true when considering how reparations outcomes vary by ethnic identity. Given that ethnic minorities are often disadvantaged in many respects, groups who were persecuted for being ethnic minorities may well have worse reparations outcomes than groups who were persecuted for non-ethnic reasons. Using original reparations data, this paper shows that ethnicity does affect reparations outcomes, albeit in unexpected ways. Ethnic minority groups are more likely to receive reparations promises than groups persecuted for non-ethnic reasons, and although ethnic minority groups are slightly less likely to receive reparations payments, most do receive the reparations they were promised, and generally they do not have to wait longer for those promises and payments than groups persecuted for non-ethnic reasons.","Keywords: Post-conflict studies, transitional justice, ethnicity","Claire Greenstein","Claire Greenstein",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Alabama at Birmingham",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1027_0030_0432.html","Russia’s anti-Western colonialism in Ukraine","This paper examines Russia’s colonial policy, particularly focusing on what can be termed ""anti-Western colonialism."" Moscow arguably engages in colonial practices against Ukrainians, driven by a deep-seated resentment of the West. This form of colonialism involves viewing these targeted groups as inferior cultures but also extends to a broader hostility toward the West itself. Russia perceives the West as hypocritical, claiming to uphold democratic values and human rights while allegedly seeking to impose its lifestyle, culture, and values on others—essentially acting as the true colonizers. Russia frames the nations they target as ""inferior"" and unable to achieve true independence or sovereignty, believing the West is manipulating these nations to act against Russian interests. According to this perspective, the targeted nations, such as Ukrainians, must either be integrated into Russia’s superior civilization, or they risk becoming mere tools of hostile Western powers in a zero-sum game. This colonialism is often intertwined with cultural genocide, aiming to erase the national identity of these groups to prevent them from being used by the West as instruments against Russia. The discourse of this anti-Western colonialism also includes a claim of self-defense: Russia argues is has been compelled to (re-)colonize Ukraine as a protective measure against Western expansionism. This is framed not only as a civilizing mission but also as a ""protection"" mission—claiming that Russians are acting in the best interest of the colonized, who are depicted as too backward and inferior to recognize the malign influence of the West or to resist it effectively.","Keywords: Russia, Ukraine, Colonialism, Cultural Genocide","Martin Larys","Martin Larys",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute of International Relations Prague",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1028_0362_0298.html","Need for Speed: High-Speed Rail and Identity Politics in Spain","Spain boasts Europe's largest high-speed rail (HSR) network, connecting Madrid with its autonomous communities under the banner of socioeconomic convergence. However, the expansion of this network raises questions about its political motivations and impacts. Why has the Spanish government prioritized connecting Madrid to certain regions over others? How do these infrastructure choices influence regional autonomy and identity politics? This paper argues that Spain’s HSR strategy is driven by a dual political agenda: fostering economic cohesion while countering regional independence movements. The central government prioritizes HSR investments in regions with distinct languages and significant support for independence, such as Catalonia. By facilitating travel, the state aims to integrate these regions economically and culturally into the national framework. Yet, this strategy often backfires, exacerbating local concerns over cultural preservation and economic redistribution. Through a subnational analysis of HSR expansion from 1992 to 2023, this research combines survival analysis of construction timelines with fieldwork in key regions, including Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Andalusia. Interviews with local stakeholders reveal mixed perceptions of HSR’s economic benefits and its impact on cultural identity and policy autonomy. This work contributes to understanding how transportation infrastructure can reshape center-periphery dynamics, even in advanced democracies. The findings shed light on Spain’s contentious regional politics and provide broader insights into the intersection of infrastructure, identity, and political power.","Keywords: subnational governance; regionalism; stateless nations; ethnic conflict; public infrastructure policy","Sarah Hunter, Adrian Shin, Pau Vall-Prat","Alberto Burgos-Rivera","University of Colorado Boulder","Sarah Hunter","Clemson University","Adrian Shin","University of Colorado Boulder; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid–IC","Pau Vall-Prat","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid–IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Colorado Boulder","Clemson University","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid–IC","JM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1029_0425_0267.html","Explaining Secularization: Evidence from the Swedish School Inspectorate","Many administrative functions that are now performed by secular government agencies were once performed by religious officials. The transfer of political authority from churches, ecclesiastical orders, and religious associations to secular administrative organizations is a key aspect of secularization---a major social transformation in Western European societies that started in the early-modern period and gained momentum in the late eighteenth century. This paper examines the secularization of primary education in Sweden between the middle of the nineteenth century and the middle of the twentieth by analyzing the composition of the country's national school inspectorate. We collected detailed biographical data on every individual school inspector in Sweden between 1861 and 1958 and matched them with data on the geographical areas they served. Our main goal is to understand when and why political decision-makers appointed school inspectors with professional educational backgrounds versus those with ties to the national church. We show that the process of secularization was gradual (it did not happen all at once) and uneven (it did not happen at the same time, or in the same manner, across the country). Most notably, we find that the rise of social movements such as religious nonconformism and trade unionism was associated with a delay in secularization. In regions where these movements gained strength, political decision-makers were more inclined to appoint school inspectors affiliated with the national church rather than professional educators. Conservative Christian political leaders sought to use the school inspectorate as an instrument to counteract the influence of emerging social movements.","Keywords: secularization, schools, Sweden, political history","Johannes Lindvall","Ann-Ida Gyllenspetz","University of Gothenburg"," Johannes Lindvall","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In such situations, do politicians believe they can use the legislative process to diminish the electoral impact of unpopular policy outcomes? Few empirical works examine whether this is the case or applies to local government legislatures. In this paper, I examine the legislative process at the US municipal level and employ two surveys on elected municipal officials from across the US to better understand the local legislative process and test their perceptions of the electoral effects of different legislative tactics, using two separate vignette experiments. I find evidence that policymakers believe obfuscating procedures, and delegation in particular, can facilitate blame avoidance but may not always hinder credit-claiming, even among engaged voters who witness the legislative process unfold. More generally, I find that the legislative process is quite uniform across municipalities and perceived by local policymakers as being consequential to their reelection interests. This paper contributes to a small but growing literature that seeks to understand elected officials' perceptions of the electoral consequences of their actions, an important contribution to the study of democracy since major theories of legislative behavior and representation hinge on these rarely-measured perceptions of elected policymakers.","Keywords: representation, legislative process, elite survey","Adam Dynes","Adam Dynes",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Brigham Young University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the possibility that negative practices may diffuse has sometimes been acknowledged, it has never been the object of serious study. This paper uses the diffusion of subnational recall elections in Peru (the most intensive user of the recall worldwide) to conduct the first study of negative or perverse diffusion dynamics. It exploits the availability of a large number of observations (1,634 districts) and a relatively long time series (1996-2014), to leverage variation in the presence of recall elections within districts over time and uncover the effect of neighbours’ behaviours and the dynamics of political competition on the probability a recall takes place. The paper shows how recalls diffuse spatially through a process of social learning in which information about the political viability of this institution is transmitted to the local politicians who are responsible for its repeated activation. These politicians learn to (ab)use participatory institutions to re-do elections regardless of voter's preferences.","Keywords: diffusion, recall elections, direct democracy","Mariana Alvarado","Mariana Alvarado",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Geneva",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Partisanship and Reactions to Electoral Outcomes in Argentina","Partisans who back illiberal measures in their benefit jeopardize democracy. We rely on original survey and focus group data from Argentina, a severely polarized nation, to explore important precursors of bottom-up support for backsliding. First, we show that partisans construct regime stereotypes, depicting fellow partisans as democratic and rivals as authoritarian. This offers fertile ground for justifications of exclusionary policies. Second, an experiment with random assignment to post-election scenarios describing a party’s landslide victory allows us to study whether partisan affect exacerbates emotional reactivity and/or shapes trust in democratic institutions in the face of victory/defeat. All Argentine partisans are emotionally reactive, whereas conditionally democratic attitudes are more salient among Kirchnerists/Peronists. We attribute this difference to the nature of partisanship. Unlike their rivals, who are mostly negative partisans, Peronists/Kirchnerists profess the strongest positive creed in the system. Elections can therefore turn into moments of existential angst, during which the idea of losing becomes particularly intolerable. Our analysis thus illuminates the conditions that render polarization harmful for democracy. If partisan beliefs about the reliability of elections or enthusiasm for democracy depend on victory, the door suddenly opens for leaders to manipulate feeble democratic commitments in the event of defeat.","Keywords: polarization, democratic backsliding, Latin America, experiments, focus groups","Ezequiel Gonzalez Ocantos","Ezequiel Gonzalez Ocantos","University of Oxford","Carlos Melendez","Universidad Diego Portales, Chile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","Universidad Diego Portales, Chile",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I seek to fill this gap by analyzing Italian parliamentary speeches and debates from 2013 to 2022. While support for populists is rising all across Europe, Italy is unmatched in its electoral support for populists, making it the ideal case to examine the competing factors that influence both populist and non-populist politician’s rhetorical choices.

The Causal Effect of a Populist Challenger Party's Candidacy on Party Competition","Elections are ultimately a zero-sum game, where the entry of a new party inevitably leads to electoral losses for some established parties. This article examines the causal effect of a populist challenger’s candidacy on party competition, analyzing whether it primarily mobilizes formerly abstaining voters, exacerbates the decline of mainstream parties, or attenuates the rise of other challenger parties. Leveraging a natural experiment coinciding with the 2024 European election, we study County Council elections in five German states, where the newly founded Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) contested in some counties but not others. Using covariate balancing propensity scores, we weight municipalities on key sociodemographic, economic, and political covariates, ensuring credible as-if randomization to estimate the average treatment effect of BSW candidacy on turnout and established party vote shares. Our robust findings, generalizable beyond the local context, reveal a significant reduction in vote shares for all established parties except the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), with no evidence of increased voter mobilization due to BSW’s entry. These results have important implications for party competition dynamics and the functioning of representative democracy in the presence of multiple populist challengers.","Keywords: BSW, Challenger Parties, Populism, Party Competition, Causal Analysis","Stefan Eschenwecker","Stefan Eschenwecker","University of Mannheim"," Thomas König","University of Mannheim","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Partisan Divides, (Il)Liberalisms, and International-Oriented Protest","In a hyper-globalized world where competing forms of liberal and illiberal internationalisms are pronounced through protest movements, what role do domestic politics play in shaping these currents of international politics? How do domestic divides shape willingness towards international-oriented protest, where individuals protest on behalf of populations or policies occurring abroad? Focusing on the US, I theorize two partisan pathways that lead to international protest participation: Democrats may perceive efficacy and domestic consequences and Republicans may perceive organizational ties and ‘outwards influence’ as key motivations. Overall, I argue Democrats are more willing to participate in an international protest relative to Republicans. Utilizing abortion-rights as a case study and not taking for granted the assumed overlap between issue-partisanship, I also theorize that pro-life Democrats are most likely to participate in an international oriented protest due to a combination of protest efficacy and religious organizational ties.I field a US online survey and find support for the theorized correlations and mechanisms. Democrats are particularly willing to protest for an international abortion issue, especially if they identify as pro-life, due to aligning with Democrats on the protest's efficacy, while being socio-organizationally aligned with Republicans on how the international is perceived. Commonalities with both parties mean that pro-life Democrats have a winning motivational cocktail for international-oriented protest. Such findings have implications for understanding protest behaviour for other issues cutting across partisan lines, complicates conventional perceptions of liberal protest being more internationally oriented, and demonstrate the domestic foundations of liberal and illiberal forms of international solidarity.","Keywords: Protest, Partisanship, International Solidarity, Survey, Abortion","Agnes Yu","Agnes Yu",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose a new methodology that considerably generalizes existing research in two respects: First, we define the idea of a ""structured"" item response theory model as a generalization of the traditional ""hierarchical"" item response theory model where we allow an individual's latent trait to be a function of (multiple) hierarchical terms as well as modelling the item parameters (e.g., the discrimination parameter) hierarchically. In our empirical example using data from the European Parliament, this allows us to model the MEP's ideal point as depending on their party grouping and country as well as modelling the bill parameters as a function of the topic of the bill, the type of question under consideration, etc. This allows a more nuanced understanding of how different factors shape the ideology of MEPs.Methodologically, we provide a new framework for fast estimation on large datasets using variational inference. We derive a closed form algorithm for estimating these ideal points even when they are multidimensional as well as some novel parameter-expansion techniques to accelerate convergence.

This development occurs at a time when media and party systems have experienced rapid transformations. Ideological cleavages are increasingly emerging not only between but also within many political parties. Meanwhile, highly ideological and digitally networked media organizations create informational networks that feed into partisan politics. To understand how these developments are tied together, we examine a case from the United States, where the topic of “Critical Race Theory” (CRT) diffused from being a far-right talking point into mainstream politics. We construct an original dataset of right-wing as well as mainstream news sources and analyze the role of Republican politicians in spreading this agenda item. We then examine what distinguishes these Republicans from others by looking at various indicators for ideological preferences as well as modes of connectivity. We find that a particular faction of Republican elites—who are particularly extreme in Congress and more connected to digital right-wing media—play an outsized role. The combination of these factors, ideology and connectivity, predicts whether a Republican Member of Congress will help spread the “CRT” agenda. We refer to this mechanism as an emerging “logic of connective faction” and discuss the implications of this finding for Congress, the Republican Party, media systems, and for actors beyond the US.","Keywords: Far-Right Radicalization, Right-Wing Media, Republican Party, Digital Networks, Connective Action, Intra-Party Factions","Mike Cowburn","Mike Cowburn","European University Viadrina","Curd Knüpfer","University of Southern Denmark","Yunkang Yang","Texas A&M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Viadrina","University of Southern Denmark","Texas A&M",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper builds on this gap and offers a comparison of the terms of belonging as defined by majority group members in two minority nations, namely Quebec and Scotland.Two objectives are pursued. First, we compare the terms of belonging in Quebec and Scotland, more specifically, comparing the markers of national identity that are most salient in the two minority national contexts. Second, we explore the connection between the predominant markers of national identity in Quebec and Scotland and how they shape views toward minority groups.More specifically, we examine how the terms of belonging shape views in relation to whether immigration intakes should be increased or decreased, and following Berry’s work (1997) we examine to what extent majority group members expect immigrants to learn the host culture and to shed the culture of their country of origin. Moreover, we examine views toward other national minorities residing in Quebec and Scotland, respectively anglophones and English people.The paper relies on two online surveys conducted in Quebec in 2022 (n=2400) and in Scotland in 2023 (n=1200) among majority group members using similar question wordings.","Keywords: National identity, Boundary Markers; Immigration, Minority Nations","Antoine Bilodeau","Antoine Bilodeau","Concordia University","Ailsa Henderson","University of Edinburgh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Concordia University","University of Edinburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that accuracy in assessments is frequently overshadowed by wishful thinking and partisan cues, leading to asymmetrical congruence between these actors in their predictions. Findings from two cross-sectional surveys reveal that partisan and wishful biases shape perceptions of governance probability and change in seats, affecting both citizens and politicians.

While some argue this simplifies decision-making, critics warn it may mislead citizens when parties deviate from their typical policies. This study examines how the party system mitigates this risk. It proposes that cues from other parties serve as ""fire alarms"" for partisans, alerting them to deviations from their party's typical policies. Through 24 preregistered experiments involving partisans from all parties in the Danish parliament across three central issues, the study finds that the structure of party conflict shapes partisans' understanding and support for a policy from their party. Importantly, when policy proposals from partisans' own parties are opposed by parties with similar policy reputations to their own party and supported by parties with dissimilar policy reputations, partisans infer that the policy is atypical for their party and decrease their support. This shows how political institutions influence citizens' decision-making processes.","Keywords: Policy opinions, Party reputations, Party conflict, Party cues, Heuristics","Love Christensen","Love Christensen","Aarhus University; University of Gothenburg","Rune Slothuus","Aarhus University","Rasmus Skytte","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1045_0568_1507.html","Crony Capitalism in the Spotlight: How Revolving Doors Affect Markets and Democracy","Revolving door appointments—where politicians transition into private sector roles—are a global phenomenon with dual implications: they promise strategic value for firms while fueling public concerns about cronyism and \textit{quid pro quo} arrangements. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework to distinguish between appointments motivated by a politician’s skills and connections and those perceived as political favors. Leveraging a unique dataset of over 100 appointments spanning two decades in Spain, a country where revolving doors are particularly controversial, the study examines the heterogeneous responses of financial markets and voters to these appointments. The findings highlight a stark divergence in perceptions. Financial markets respond positively to appointments seen as leveraging political expertise but react negatively to those perceived as politically motivated, reflecting concerns about inefficiencies and reputational risks. In contrast, voter reactions are predominantly negative, with announcements correlating with declines in trust in institutions such as political parties and parliament. Negative media coverage exacerbates these effects, revealing the critical role of public discourse. This paper makes two key contributions. First, it develops a new framework to understand the dual nature of revolving doors, offering nuanced insights into how financial markets evaluate political connections. Second, it pioneers an empirical investigation into voter reactions, expanding the literature’s scope to include the democratic consequences of revolving doors. By integrating financial and public perspectives, this study underscores the dual-edged nature of revolving doors, which enhance firm value under some conditions but erode public trust in governance and accountability.","Keywords: finance, cronyism, democracy","David Vilalta","David Vilalta",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our paper studies this underexamined trade-off by testing how introducing elected subnational executives affects elite composition and turnover. We leverage a quasi-experiment in Kazakhstan. In June 2021, President Tokayev began a staged roll-out of rural executive elections amid regime transition, mass demand for reform, and then January 2022's 'Bloody January' protests. Since then, over 2,300 rural akims (mayors) have been elected. We map these elections and use new biographic data to compare the careers of appointed and elected akims. With sequence analysis, we assess elite turnover, diversity, and career trajectories. Our pilot analysis finds notably high turnover of existing local elites. We identify a consistent 'path to power' among akims: While experience in government and agriculture are associated with victory, we find surprising underrepresentation of those from business, military service, and the arts.

"abstract_1048_1832_0376.html","Aggrieved majorities: How victimized ideologies affect national minorities","Historical grievances play a pivotal role in shaping the political behavior and demands of ethnic groups in divided societies, often persisting long after the events that generated them. Victimization narratives, in particular, act as a potent ideological mechanism, reviving past grievances and fostering a perception of perpetual threat. Even politically dominant ethnic groups can adopt such narratives, portraying themselves as vulnerable population to justify exclusionary and aggressive actions vis-à-vis out-groups. This paper explores the consequences of victimized ideological justifications by Majority Nationalist Movements regarding their treatment of national minorities, arguing that victimization narratives increase the risk of violent outcomes. While existing research acknowledges the importance of nationalist narratives and historical claims in shaping ethnic conflict, these factors are rarely examined in a systematic, cross-national context. Particularly underexplored is the role of majority nationalism and its ideological underpinnings, as opposed to the predominant focus on minority grievances. Utilizing a novel dataset tracking ideological justifications and demands of Majority Nationalist Movements from 1945 to 2023, this paper addresses these gaps by systematically examining the victimization dimension of nationalist ideologies. Employing staggered difference-in-difference design, the analysis demonstrates that victimization narratives are significantly associated with an increased likelihood of one-sided ethnic violence, targeted mass killings, expulsions, and discrimination against ethnic out-groups by majority nationalists. These findings not only further our understanding of the dynamics of ethnic conflict and ethnic power relations, but also have significant implications for institutional designs in ethnically divided societies, and for designing conflict resolutions that are not color-blind to ideologies.","Keywords: Ideologies, one-sided-violence, narratives, Nationalism, discrimination","Aya Abdelrahman","Aya Abdelrahman",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH ZurichCenter for International Studies (CIS)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1049_0868_0434.html","The logic of violence against aid workers","Neutrality is a cornerstone of humanitarian operations, allowing aid workers to negotiate access in politically charged settings. Aid organizations need to be able to successfully signal neutrality. If they are successful, their neutrality needs to be accepted by armed groups, governments, and local communities. In autocracies, neutrality is often compromised when humanitarian actors are perceived as aligned with the regime after being granted access. This creates suspicions among non-state armed groups (NSAGs), increasing the likelihood of attacks on aid workers, as these groups cannot impose administrative restrictions on aid delivery. Conversely, in democracies, state actors are more likely to target aid workers to prevent NSAGs from benefiting from humanitarian aid, which could undermine the regime’s stability. Using novel panel data, I show that the risks aid workers face differ significantly between autocratic and democratic contexts. While neutrality remains essential for access, acceptance of neutrality by one side of the conflict paradoxically compromises the perception of neutrality by the other side.","Keywords: neutrality, humanitarian aid, conflict dynamics, autocracies, violence","Melanie Sauter","Melanie Sauter",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here I propose that when elites need to tolerate human capital advancements among subordinate out-groups, they deploy ideology as a particularly well-suited tool for containing threats that may arise from the out-group and poor members of their in-group and thereby safeguarding elites’ status. I examine the emergence of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), which dedicated extensive resources to propagating the “Lost Cause.” This ideology aimed at legitimating white dominance, psychologically compensating poor whites for status loss, and sustaining prejudice against Blacks – through various different channels, including educational content in Southern white public schools between 1900 and 1920. Using original quantitative data on the formation of UDC chapters at the county level, I show that UDC chapters emerged in response to local advancements in Black human capital and in-group inequality. Qualitative evidence demonstrates how elites thought about this dilemma and the strategic purpose of their ideological mobilization.","Keywords: Racial politics, ideology, American political development","Roxanne Rahnama","Roxanne Rahnama",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At its apex, the Central Asian empire stretched its territories across Eurasia to form the largest contiguous land empire in history. What was its immediate and long-term influence? Our study explores the geographic extent to which the Mongols spread their territories and their subsequent impact on local development. We use historical climatic anomalies as exogenous contingencies that could drive their expansion and identify which regions were more likely to have been invaded by the Mongols. Our main findings suggest that the Mongols' territorial consolidation encouraged urbanization by providing a safe overland passage for traders, but their conquests and urbicides across Eurasia negatively impacted local development over the subsequent centuries.","Keywords: Nomads, Mongolian Empire, Central Asia, Political fragmentation","Christopher Paik","Christopher Paik","New York University Abu Dhabi"," Haoyu Zhai","New York University Abu Dhabi","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper analyzes over 10,000 legislative acts in German federal states to examine whether government fragmentation and ideological diversity hinder decision-making. Specifically, it focuses on the final year of legislative terms, a critical period where electoral pressures peak. The study hypothesizes that fragmented coalitions or those with ideologically distant partners face greater challenges in reaching decisions compared to single-party governments or ideologically cohesive coalitions. The findings confirm this hypothesis: fragmented and ideologically diverse governments enact fewer laws, particularly in salient policy areas where ideological disagreements are most pronounced. By contrast, single-party governments and coalitions with aligned policy platforms demonstrate more efficient legislative processes.

Traditionally associated with older, white, educated, and affluent voters, mail voting has also been linked to low levels of voter confidence. However, a nuanced relationship exists, as individuals might opt for mail voting if they are confident their vote will count, or their confidence might increase after casting a mail ballot and becoming familiar with the process. Therefore, the presence of simultaneity is the primary source of bias when estimating the causal effect of voter confidence on mail voting. To control for this source of potential bias, I employ a robust set of instruments and a two-stage least squares approach to identify the effect of voter confidence on mail voting. Utilizing data from the 2016-2024 Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE) and an instrumental variable approach, findings show that those with higher levels of voter confidence, overall, are more likely to cast a mail ballot.","Keywords: mail voting, voter confidence, endogeneity","Enrijeta Shino","Enrijeta Shino",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Alabama",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While a growing literature finds that conflict between populist and mainstream parties is a major driver of affective polarization, and that this divide exists at both the mass and elite levels, no work has been done thus far examining whether the attacks mainstream elites level against their populist opponents actually persuade voters to support them over the populists. Using event data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning Dataset from 13 European Countries we show that parties who behaved more conflictual towards populists in the run up to elections saw their vote shares decrease relative to the previous election. We show that this effect is entirely driven by incumbent parties. We also find suggestive evidence that attacks on populist parties in the run up to elections actually serve to increase their vote shares relative to the last election.","Keywords: populism, Europe, polarization, party elites, electoral politics","Alexa Federice, Braeden Davis","Alexa Federice","University of California, Davis"," Braeden Davis","University of California, Davis","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California, Davis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This question is critical given the global rise of far right parties which makes government formation increasingly difficult. Commentators and pundits alike increasingly argue that the appeal of the far right could be broken by including far right parties in government. The idea is that taking over government responsibility, dealing with the constraints of day-to-day politics and making policy compromises would make it difficult for far right parties to maintain their popular appeal. We argue instead that including far right parties in government is a dangerous strategy as it further normalizes and legitimizes these parties, reinforcing far-right attitudes and behaviors. We test our argument using a newly compiled novel dataset covering 478 cabinets in 27 European countries from 1980 to 2023. We identify the causal effect of far right participation in government on subsequent electoral performance, political attitudes and hate crimes relying on a difference-in-differences design.

Through survey experiments in the US and Tunisia, and analysis of observational data on foreign support towards rebel groups, this research argues that female combatants signal humane treatment and liberal values within rebel groups, attracting international support. Findings show that foreign audiences are more likely to endorse government sponsorship when female combatants are present. This support is driven by perceptions of these groups as more gender-equal, democratic, moral, and less likely to harm civilians. Testing whether these favorable views translate into state support, cross-national evidence suggests that gender-diverse groups are more likely to attract democratic support. In addition to establishing gender composition as a factor attracting external conflict support, this study contributes to broader debates on the gender equality-peace nexus, humanitarian aid, rebel legitimacy, and gender stereotypes in nontraditional political spheres.","Keywords: rebel groups, female combatants, civil wars, external support, conflict","Caglayan Baser","Caglayan Baser",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bilkent University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing approaches have often relied on two-way fixed effects or hierarchical models with the Mundlak device. However, these methods can yield biased estimates when the timing of treatment varies across units. In response, new difference-in-differences estimators have been introduced to address the problem of staggered adoption. While these new approaches are flexible, they have not tackled two additional challenges commonly encountered when studying policy effects on public opinion across nations: first, that public opinion is not directly observed and must be inferred from noisy measurements; second, that cohorts defined by the policy introduction year can be extremely small, sometimes consisting of a single country. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that explicitly accounts for known measurement error and partially mitigates small-sample concerns. We detail the model’s underlying assumptions and limitations, and then present a small simulation study demonstrating its performance. Finally, we apply our approach to the case of same-sex couples’ rights in Europe, illustrating how it can improve inference about the relationship between policy changes and shifts in public opinion.","Keywords: Bayesian, public opinion, measurement error, causal inference","Piotr Koc","Piotr Koc","GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences","Marco Steenbergen","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1058_1076_1042.html","The effectiveness of tailored online campaigning: Evidence from a field experiment targeting women","Online ads have become common practice for political campaigning. In the business world, the possibility of tailoring social media ads to specific target groups such as women, young consumers or specific regions is seen as a major ingredient of efficient persuasion. While prior research has focused on online campaigning more generally, we have very little knowledge about the effectiveness of tailored messages. We argue that political messages  tailored to the specific needs and priorities of specific voter groups is a highly promising strategy in political campaigning. To empirically test our argument, we fielded a large-scale field experiment in cooperation with the German Green Party. More specifically, we ran a social media campaign targeting middle-aged women in the context of the European Parliament Election in 2024.  Randomizing at the ZIP-code level, the campaign delivered messages that were specifically tailored to middle-aged women in the treatment group, while users in the control group only received generic campaign ads. Overall, the campaign reached 686,000 women. Our results show that neither aggregate-level turnout nor the vote share of the Greens has been affected by the tailored campaign. A post-election survey fielded among middle-aged women additionally indicates that ad reach and recall in the target population were very low. The results show that tailored online campaigning does not have the impact that commentators usually claim, as (1) it is very difficult to reach voters in the target group and (2) even if voters have been reached, tailored online ads do not affect voting behavior.","Keywords: campaigning, electoral behavior, mobilization, gender and politics","Frederik Thieme","Heike Klüver","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"," Frederik Thieme","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It examines the transformation of political patronage from a common feature of democratic systems into a strategic tool for dismantling democracy and entrenching hybrid regimes. The study combines theoretical insights from studies of party politics, public administration, and democratization with empirical data on political appointments in Hungary since 1990. It argues that patronage becomes a mechanism for autocratization by neutralizing institutional checks, controlling key state functions, targeting political opponents, and diverting state resources to elite supporters.Using original data on appointments to senior state secretary positions in Hungary’s central government ministries from 1990 to 2024, the study identifies distinct patterns of patronage before and after Viktor Orbán’s return to power in 2010. It distinguishes between an initiation phase of democratic regression, marked by rapid structural changes and control over critical institutions, and an entrenchment phase characterized by the consolidation of power through extensive clientelism and state capture. By demonstrating how patronage strategies evolve across these phases, the study provides a nuanced understanding of autocratic governance and its implications for democratic resilience.The findings contribute to broader debates on democratic erosion, emphasizing the interplay between party politics, state administration, and regime transitions. Hungary’s trajectory offers lessons for both scholars and policymakers on the vulnerabilities of democratic institutions and the resilience required to safeguard them in the face of authoritarian threats.","Keywords: Political Patronage

"abstract_1060_0692_1191.html","UNMASK: An Agent-based Approach for Understanding Nationalist Mobilisation on Social Media Networks","How do social media platforms shape individual national identities and contribute to the mobilisation for radical-right parties? It is widely accepted that digital media contributes to the spread of radical-right’s politics by selectively exposing individuals to nationalistic rhetoric, filter bubbles and misinformation. Yet, the real shift produced by digital technologies has been the transformation of citizens from passive media audiences to active media producers. This study argues that network affordances of social media enable users to engage in regressive interactions—such as hate speech, stereotyping, and trolling—with like-minded others, without fear of norm violation or sanctions. These interactions, perceived to be insulated from scrutiny, normalise and legitimise exclusionary discourse. As users gain validation, these sentiments seep into their public expressions, not only shaping the individual sense of national identity but also changing the broader discourses on national identity. Developing UNMASK, an agent-based model, the study stimulates the propagation of such discourse in online networks, and its impact on exclusionary national identity. The ABM results are validated against Twitter data on the European refugee in Germany and Italy, analysed through social network analysis and NLP techniques. The findings reveal that centralised, homophilic networks allow backstage discourse to transition into public expressions of exclusionary nationalism, whereas more decentralised, dispersed networks limit this diffusion. This paper fills a critical gap in the literature by demonstrating how the mobilisation of exclusionary nationalism unfolds at the individual level on social media networks, and how these dynamics may influence political outcomes such as voting for radical-right parties.","Keywords: National identity, radical-right parties, European politics, computational social sciences, agent-based modelling, Twitter, social media, social network analysis, natural language processing","Kavyanjali Kaushik","Kavyanjali Kaushik",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Social Sciences, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1061_0986_1200.html","Does (district) size matter? How political parties tailor targeting in different electoral contexts","The rise of social networks has revolutionised political communication, providing parties with powerful tools to target and engage voters with precision. This study explores how political parties adjust their advertising strategies based on electoral outcomes and regional characteristics. It specifically investigates the role of regional factors—such as district magnitude and party system fragmentation—in shaping these strategies. Using the Meta Ad Targeting Dataset, we analyse a sample of approximately 15,000 ads to understand how Spanish political parties tailor their messaging geographically. By integrating targeting data with regional political and historical factors, the study uncovers the strategic motivations behind digital political advertising. Our results demonstrate that the Effective Number of Electoral Parties (ENEP) is a significant predictor of targeting strategies in a region. In fragmented political systems like Spain, this suggests that parties adapt their messages to appeal to niche audiences, where vote margins are narrower and mobilisation becomes more critical. We also find that, on average, Spanish statewide parties focus their advertising efforts on smaller districts (excluding Podemos). Additionally, parties that were close to securing the last seat in a region tend to intensify their efforts in the following election, aiming to surpass this threshold. These findings contribute to the growing field of online political communication, offering new insights into how parties navigate the evolving digital and electoral landscape. The study highlights the interplay between regional dynamics and the influence of social media platforms in shaping political messaging, shedding light on how electoral strategies evolve within multilevel governance contexts.","Keywords: political targeting, multilevel governance, political parties, social media, elections","Irene Rodríguez","Irene Rodríguez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1062_1041_1316.html","Close to Home: Local Politicians and Turnout","A large body of research has shown voters' preference for local politicians across different political settings. While the vote-earning potential of candidates' local traits is well documented in both experimental and observational studies, evidence on whether such traits can mobilise voters and increase turnout remains scarce. Moreover, little is known about whether electing a local candidate affects turnout in subsequent elections. Drawing from the literature on descriptive representation and the winner-loser gap in satisfaction with democracy, I argue that municipalities descriptively represented in parliament may experience higher turnout thanks to a stronger sense of efficacy among voters and more intense campaign efforts by incumbents in their hometowns. In this paper, I leverage an original dataset combining municipality-level election results with detailed data on Italian legislators and candidates from 1948 to 2022. Employing generalised difference-in-differences and matching methods, I investigate the effect of local candidates and geographic representation on turnout. In the period analysed, Italy offers variation in electoral rules, allowing me to examine whether electoral institutions influence the potential effects of localism.  Additionally, I complement these aggregate analyses with individual-level election survey data. This study advances our understanding of voter turnout and localism, exploring the broader implications of voters' preference for local politicians and its downstream effects on political participation.","Keywords: turnout, descriptive representation, geographic representation","Edoardo Alberto Viganò","Edoardo Alberto Viganò",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Witten/Herdecke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding shifts in EU support: Panel data evidence from Spain (2017–2024) ","Since the end of permissive consensus, public attitudes toward the European Union have become increasingly central to political and electoral behaviour, both at national and EU levels. While extensive research has focused on individual-level determinants of between-person variation in EU opinions, considerably less is understood about the dynamics of within-individual change. In other words, while we know much about why individuals differ in their views on the EU, we know far less about how personal experiences and societal changes influence shifts in these views over time. The paper addresses this gap by relying on data from the last eight waves (2017-2024) of a 16-wave yearly panel survey conducted in Spain. This longitudinal dataset tracks individual attitudes toward various aspects of the EU (output evaluations, institutional trust, and integration preferences), alongside respondents' economic conditions, cultural predispositions and ideological preferences. The panel structure of the data allows us to explore how individual changes in status and political attitudes (differently) relate to shifts in different dimensions of EU support while automatically ruling out the effect of time-constant confounders. Additionally, the concurrent rise of radical-right political actors in Spain provides a compelling context to examine how Eurosceptic parties mobilize cultural and economic grievances against the EU. This study offers valuable insights at a critical juncture when shifts in voter preferences are reshaping the political landscape at the EU level.","Keywords: European Union, Attitude changes, Panel Data, Survey, Radical Right","Roberto Pannico","Roberto Pannico","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona"," Guillem Rico","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This means that we can compare how voters of specific gender and age vote compared against how they declare to have voted. Using mis-declarations of one’s vote as a measure of preference falsification to follow established norms, we test which groups of voters are more likely to follow established political norms that incentivize turnout and dis-incentivize supporting the far-right.

Yet experimental and other studies reveal little sign that voters prefer politicians from upper and middle classes -- indeed, often the preference is for those from working-class backgrounds and occupations (Carnes & Lupu, 2016; Elsässer, 2024; Kevins, 2021; Vivyan et al., 2020). One route to reconciling these findings is to suggest that voters' biases operate not via static features of a candidate's CV, like occupation, but instead through other 'living' markers of class such as accent. The latter is well established as a source of prejudice and stereotyping in the highly class-conscious context of the UK.In this paper, we report a 'verbal guise' or aural vignette experiment in which the same political text is spoken by actors in five common English accents. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the accents and then asked a number of questions about the candidate that they had just heard. We address two main research questions: first, are accents a cue for class? second, do they have consequences for candidate (trait) evaluations? The answer in both cases is 'yes'. Strikingly, most of the accent effect is direct, i.e. not mediated by class. In either case, though, accent popularity is *negatively* associated with social class , with a particular rejection of the politician with the most upper-middle-class accent. On this trial, at least, we reject the hypothesis that working-class candidates are handicapped by the way they talk.","Keywords: social class, accent, prejudice, stereotype, candidate preference","Rob Johns","Dan Devine","University of Southampton"," Rob Johns","University of Southampton","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Southampton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1066_1153_1533.html","Panel: Bureaucratic Politics in Comparative Perspective - The Seeds of State Capture: Unpacking Public Sector Hiring in Ghana’s Colonial Bureaucracy","The dominant narrative of the post-colonial African state is that newly installed leaders adopted ""neo-patrimonial"" hiring practices, using state positions to consolidate their power. Given the salience of ethnicity, and rulers' ties to certain ethnic groups, these practices often resulted in ethnic bias. Further, ethnic imbalances in access to state resources fuelled political instability. A salient assumption within this narrative is that under colonial rule, civil service hiring was meritocratic, and that any ethnic favoritism was a result of groups' differential exposure to education. We digitize fine-grained, bureaucrat-level data from the entire period of Britain's colonial rule of the Gold Coast (later Ghana) and show that this assumption is incorrect. Using contemporary census and voter registration data to uniquely code each colonial bureaucrats' likely ethnicity, we demonstrate significant ethnic bias in hiring throughout Ghana's colonial period. We argue that this bias resulted from patrimonial practices by groups that gained early entry to state positions. Using exam results data from potential civil servants from the colonial period, we further demonstrate that hiring was not meritocratic. Our results imply the need to re-evaluate claims about post-colonial politics, suggesting that many leaders did not inherit an ethnically-balanced and meritocratic civil service upon which to build. Instead, the seeds of state capture had already been sown.","Keywords: Bureaucracy, Patronage, Meritocracy, Neopatrimonialism","Sarah Brierley","Sarah Brierley","","Noah Nathan",".

After surveying 2500 survivors of the 1992-5 Bosnian conflict---the first nationwide survey on wartime rescue in a post-conflict state---I find that cross-group assistance was both widespread and strongly correlated with respondents having more cross-group ties. Yet surprisingly, the strength of those ties does not appear to have had much impact. Most people, it seems, were willing to help not only close friends but even friends-of-friends and acquaintances. Drawing on 160 new interviews with helpers and recipients, I theorize how networks activate cross-group social capital to channel aid to those in need. To address problems in recall bias and demand effects, I validate these findings with three novel data sources: a long-overlooked 1990 census table that disaggregates intermarriage rates by municipality, a newly-completed database covering over 96% of wartime fatalities, and over 130 oral histories collected by multiple local researchers during and after the war.  Together, these sources provide compelling evidence for a model that explains how diverse networks lead people to not only save lives but perform everyday acts of kindness during riots, genocide, state repression, and civil war.","Keywords: Civil War, Rescue, Networks, Genocide, Bosnia","Matthew Simonson","Matthew Simonson",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1071_1313_0433.html","Grappling with Grand Theories (of War):  Evaluating General Explanations of Armed Conflict Using LLM-Assisted Meta Analysis","What explains armed conflict? A large literature offers general explanations for armed conflict, yet many of these explanations compete with one another. Science typically advances by adjudicating the relative strength of general theories, but conflict scholarship remains focused on testing medium-range hypotheses about specific causal relationships. How, then, can we evaluate the overall evidentiary strength of general theories, which often imply multiple medium-range hypotheses?Two dominant approaches address this question: qualitative literature reviews and meta-analyses of estimated relationships. Qualitative reviews are subjective and lack a systematic framework for aggregating evidence into a clear and comparable measure of theory strength. Meanwhile, meta-analyses are restricted to evaluations of causal relationships of the same form (e.g. multiple experiments on the same relationship) but struggle to map different types of evidence onto general theories, as these theories often generate overlapping empirical implications and many different types of implications (than what meta-analyses can incorporate). This paper introduces a novel approach to theory-strength evaluation, designed for evaluating general theories. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze theories in the domain of armed conflict, and focusing primarily on the case of the bargaining theory of war. The approach scans a set of published articles on armed conflict using a pre-specified list of empirical implications and clear evidence parameters. This can consider evidence for multiple different implications, different types of evidence, and different levels of analysis. The evidence is then aggregated using Bayesian Evidence Synthesis, providing a systematic and transparent evaluation of general theories' relative strength.","Keywords: war, armed conflict, theory, meta-analysis, AI, methods","Tore Wig","Tore Wig",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1072_1391_0297.html","How Sports Nationalism Impacts Attitudes Toward Political Violence and Economic Redistribution","Nationalism stands out as one of the most influential ideational forces of the modern era. Not only is it the key driver of modern nation states, but it is also strongly associated with a myriad of other important aspects of politics such as preferences for redistribution, attitudes toward violence in multi-ethnic societies, and beliefs about past instances of violence. However, most scholarly work addressing the effects of nationalism is inherently limited in its ability to credibly identify the causal effect of nationalism. We explore the effects of nationalism—triggered through large-scale sporting events—-on two sets of outcomes: (1) support for political violence and (2) support for redistribution. In both cases, we expect a strengthened sense of national identity to be the central mechanism driving our findings. We explore the effects of large international sport events and subsequent nationalism in two ways: First, we make use of a panel set-up in which we compare survey responses among comparable respondents in the UK during and after a large sport event (2024 UEFA Cup). Second, we include a survey experiment which highlights the sport event to examine its effects within survey waves. We evaluate our hypotheses by (1) comparing respondents who took the survey during the sport event as compared to those who took the same survey in its aftermath and (2) comparing respondents who were assigned to the treatment vs. control within the same wave. Finally, (3) we explore the interaction between experimental treatment and survey wave as in a 2x2 design.","Keywords: sports, nationalism, redistribution, political violence, survey","Nikitas Konstantinidis","Nikitas Konstantinidis",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"IE UniversityUniversity Carlos III of MadridOhio State UniversityHarvard Business SchoolUniversity of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1073_1196_0270.html","Racial Order in Changing Societies: Evidence from the United States","Why do states institutionalize discrimination? While the negative effects of discriminatory policies are well documented, their origins remain underexplored. I study Jim Crow in the American South, a blueprint for racial regimes worldwide. Using natural language processing tools on a novel dataset of Southern state legislation (1870–1920), I find that public goods—such as schools and churches—expanded in a segregated manner long before the adoption of statewide Jim Crow laws. Given segregation was already widespread, why did states undertake this major legislative effort years later? I argue that statewide Jim Crow laws emerged as a response by white agrarian elites to modernization in the “New South.” As economic development and urban growth drew Black workers away from farms, formal segregation became increasingly valuable to local elites who had historically relied on coerced labor. Using original roll call data on statewide Jim Crow legislation and a shift-share design, I show that Black urbanization increased the likelihood of county politicians voting for Jim Crow bills—but only in counties with a strong history of enslavement. I find no evidence for alternative explanations: there was little to no bottom-up backlash to Black urbanization—measured through lynching or Democratic Party voting—and the data is not consistent with traditional explanations, such as the Populist electoral threat, the effect of disenfranchisement, or the Supreme Court’s sanctioning of segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson. This critical period in U.S. history reveals how modernization can entrench, rather than erode, racial orders, offering new insights into the origins of institutional discrimination.","Keywords: race, economic development, legislative politics, American politics, HPE","Daniel Urquijo","Daniel Urquijo",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of 3,462 legislators and nearly 37,000 roll call votes spanning four EP terms, we apply a staggered difference-in-differences approach to isolate the causal effect of quotas implemented at the level of national party delegations. Our analysis reveals that quotas substantially increase legislative turnout among female MEPs—particularly when they remain a minority within their parties. Moreover, this positive effect extends to both left- and non-left-leaning parties. We also find that quota-driven increases in female MEPs' legislative participation are concentrated in policy areas often associated with women's interests, such as gender equality, education, public health, development, and environmental sustainability. These findings enhance our understanding of how gender balance mechanisms reshape legislative behavior in a supranational setting.","Keywords: Gender Quotas, European Parliament, Legislative Behavior","Suen Wang, Mads Dagnis Jensen","Suen Wang","Aalborg University","Mads Dagnis Jensen","Copenhagen Business School","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aalborg University","Copenhagen Business School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the prominence of voting by mail grows, so too does the complexity of the rules governing this voting method. We focus on deadlines for returning VBM ballots, a subject of ongoing litigation in the U.S. and a consequential matter given VBM voters’ dependence on mail delivery for timely ballot delivery. In many states, VBM ballots delivered after Election Day are rejected outright, independent of postmark, but Nevada is an exception. Leveraging data from Clark County, Nevada, across five statewide elections that have taken place since this state instituted universal vote-by-mail, we show that VBM voters who are young, new to VBM voting, and registered Republican are disproportionately likely to have returned their VBM ballots after Election Day, all things equal. This implies that state policies on VBM ballot deadlines do not affect all types of voters uniformly. Even though Democratic VBM voters in Nevada are less likely to return late ballots than Republican VBM voters, they are more likely to vote with mail ballots in the first place. This latter point is consistent with the positions of the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump’s campaign for president, which prior to the 2024 general election jointly filed legal challenges against Nevada’s flexible VBM deadlines. Our results highlight the importance of VBM ballot receipt deadlines and the extent to which these deadlines play an increasingly important role in the American election ecosystem.","Keywords: Voting, Mail Ballots, Convenience Voting, United States, Nevada","Daniel Smith, Michael Herron","Daniel Smith","University of Florida","Michael Herron","Dartmouth College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Florida","Dartmouth College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite a growing normative consensus about the legitimacy of such measures, public opinion on these restrictions remains largely underexplored. In this paper we focus on one of the most extreme manifestations of such militant restrictions on democracy: the banning of political parties. Specifically, we analyze whether and why citizens believe that democracies can legitimately ban certain political parties. To this end, we conducted an observational study and two survey experiments in 15 European democracies, complemented by an additional conjoint experiment in four of these countries.  In these experiments, we manipulated: (i) the ideological orientation of parties promoting anti-democratic proposals; (ii) the intensity and nature of these proposals; and (iii) the popular support these parties enjoy. The findings reveal that Europeans are deeply divided over the legitimacy of banning political parties, with some citizens opposing such bans even for parties that openly advocate for overthrowing democracy. The results also reveal that these opinions are mainly influenced by citizens’ own partisan biases and their perceptions of the “real democratic threat” posed by these parties. These findings have relevant implications for ongoing debates about the legitimacy of militant democracy as a suitable approach to prevent and respond to democratic backsliding.","Keywords: Democratic backsliding, partisan bias, motivated reasoning, political parties, voting rights.","Enrique Prada","Enrique Hernández","Autonomous University of Barcelona"," Sergi Ferrer","Autonomous University of Barcelona"," Enrique Prada","Autonomous University of Barcelona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Autonomous University of Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Addressing this question empirically is challenging because mainstream parties’ strategies are often endogenous to the electoral success of radical right parties, rather than an independent cause. This article tackles this empirical challenge by leveraging changes in the way Austrian Länder executives are elected, with five of the nine states transitioning from Proporz—a system guaranteeing all represented parties above a certain threshold a share of executive power—to a more conventional majority system, which allowed for the exclusion of the radical right FPÖ. Using a staggered Difference-in-Differences framework and accounting for heterogeneous treatment effects, we analyze elections in Austria’s nine Länder from 1980 to 2021. We find that the change to majority rule was associated with increased electoral support for the FPÖ in excluded regions. Our findings contribute to the broader debate on whether exclusion or engagement with the populist radical right is the more effective strategy to limit their electoral appeal.","Keywords: Populist radical right, exclusion, Austria, executive selection rules, electoral success","Hanna Kleider, Rubén Ruiz-Rufino","Hanna Kleider","King's College London","Rubén Ruiz-Rufino","King's College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","King's College London","King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1078_1096_0835.html","How radical right success impacts mainstream party strategies on democracy","How does radical right parliamentary presence impact mainstream party strategies on democracy? In contrast to existing accounts of adversarial and accommodative party strategies, I expect that mainstream parties will adopt dismissive strategies on the democracy issue because they do not expect electoral gains from the competition on democracy and are ideologically bound to the liberal-democratic status quo. Previous research has examined mainstream party responses to radical right success on issues like the economy and immigration. As radical right parties demand more direct democratic forms of participation and criticise key veto players, I argue that democracy itself has become an electoral issue that parties compete on. I focus on European party systems between 2000 and 2021. First, I use a large language model to classify statements from election manifestos based on their content regarding democracy. Using the discontinuities created by national electoral thresholds, I then identify the causal effect of radical right parliamentary presence on mainstream party emphasis and positions on democracy. My findings show that radical right parliamentary presence leads to mainstream parties choosing dismissive strategies on the democracy issue: They talk less about democracy and do not change their position on it.

"abstract_1079_2006_0979.html","Change in position or perception? Dynamic scale usage and its implications for comparing positions across time","Understanding how individuals perceive and use ideological scales is crucial for estimating voter and party positions in latent political space across political research disciplines. Existing research shows that individuals differ in the way they use ideological scales, and suggests ways to correct for such DIF or bias. However, we know little about systematic patterns of variation in scale usage across time. While most research assumes that cross-temporal changes in perceptions reflect changes in actual positions, we lack conceptual and methodological clarity about how to differentiate changes in actual positions from changes in the scales that individuals use to perceive and report positions. The paper examines temporal and contextual variations in scale usage by analysing two German panel datasets in a novel way. To identify contextual changes in ideological scale usage, we apply a scaling model based on left-right self- and party-placements, and provide causal evidence through temporal variation (unexpected events design) and contextual stimuli (divergences in individual party placements based on different experimental scenarios).The results show that ideological scales are not static benchmarks, but are subject to considerable fluctuation, with significant variations across temporal and contextual factors. Estimates of ideological scales based on perceptions will be biased if they do not take into account temporal changes in scale perceptions, for example caused by the entry of new parties. Perceived shifts to the left or right often reflect changes in scale perceptions and political system characteristics rather than actual positional shifts, with implications for both political research and public discourse.","Keywords: scaling, left-right scale, causal inference, unexpected event design, political ideology","Lukas Warode","Lukas Warode","University of Mannheim, MZES"," Thomas Bräuninger","University of Mannheim, MZES","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim, MZES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper we investigate the media dimension of this process. How salient has feminism become in mainstream media? What exactly do the media talk about when they talk about feminism? Which issues are frequently present, and which tend to be overlooked?  What is the tone employed when speaking about these issues? How has this coverage evolved? The portrayal of the feminist movement and ideas associated with feminism in mainstream media is crucial for understanding the public’s perception of feminism. To approach this question, we analyse Spanish mainstream media coverage of feminism between 2013 and 2019 through automated text analysis. We show how feminism’s coverage has grown during crucial years in which feminism became a key feature of Spanish politics. Culture-related terms remained the main ingredient of feminist content in mainstream media throughout the period, with a growing presence of more political topics, both institutional and contentious. Key issues like violence and, particularly, equality have maintained a relatively low presence. We show that the tone employed is contingent on the topic to which feminism is associated. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Keywords: media, feminism, automated text analysis","Eva Anduiza, Leire Rincón, Damjan Tomic","Eva Anduiza","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona"," Leire Rincón","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona"," Damjan Tomic","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Additionally, we observe clear hierarchies in how interest groups are portrayed, alongside marked tonal disparities, with polarized systems exhibiting sharper contrasts in sentiment.Unexpectedly, the analysis reveals subtle intra-system variations in partisan coverage and nuanced tonal shifts that point to complex underlying media dynamics, challenging simplified categorizations of media systems.

In recent years, social media and the Internet have been blamed for spreading toxic and extremist discourse. However, we still know very little about the pathways and types of information sources accessed by individuals who position themselves on the far ends of the left-right scale. In this paper, we examine the information consumption habits of individuals with different ideological leanings. Using panel survey data and web-tracking data from 893 individuals in Spain, collected one month before and after the 2023 General Election, we analyze all political content individuals were exposed to in newspapers (N≈10.000) and social media (N≈20.000) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Second, we analyze information pathways resorting to Markov chains, thereby identifying differential patterns among far-right, far-left, and the remaining population. Preliminary results indicate that far-right individuals consume more political content than the average respondent, accessing content from legacy media, extremist websites, and political influencers. Moreover, far-right individuals are more likely than the average user to turn to social media after visiting legacy or political sites or searching for political content on search engines, whereas far-left individuals tend to continue informing themselves through similar sources. These findings reveal that individual ideological differences can lead to information pathways with different potential to fuel polarization and hinder debate across political divides.","Keywords: Political information-seeking, Extremism, Information diets, Polarization","Alejandro De la fuente-Cuesta","Alejandro De la fuente-Cuesta","University of Barcelona; Barcelona Supercomputing Center","Laia Castro","University of Barcelona; Barcelona Supercomputing Center","Yuan Zhang","University of Zurich","Frank Esser","University of Zurich","Jihye Park","University of Zurich","Pamina Syed Al","University of Zurich","Michael Amsler","University of Zurich","","","","","","","University of Barcelona","University of Zurich","Barcelona Supercomputing Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Beyond the online and offline distinction, the study also investigates how actors and issue characteristics—such as public salience, technical complexity, and support from other groups—affect the selection of different forms of argumentation in these messages.Our conjoint experiments are run in 10 different countries, allowing for a comparative analysis of how advocacy strategies vary across diverse political and cultural contexts.

A fundamental concern to the functioning of representative democracy is therefore 'the problem of space', i.e., the geographical inequality of access to political representation: How can peripherally and centrally residing MPs have equitable access to representing their constituents in parliament? Existing research documents that geographic inequality in representation is prevalent in rich democracies, and that voters prefer candidates with local ties. However, the representational effects of this inequality remain unclear. We remedy this gap, studying the geographical representation and behavior of Danish MPs from 1990--2022 with a novel data set linking MP residence and other characteristics to parliamentary behavior. For causal identification we exploit a series of reforms that jointly dramatically lowered commuting costs specifically for peripheral candidates, namely i) the opening of the Great Belt Bridge, which reduced travel time to parliament, ii) the introduction of a dual residence allowance, and iii) the provision of a free MP apartment close to parliament. We study the effects of these reforms on representational behavior for geographically peripheral vs. central MPs. Our results have implications for how to promote and sustain geographical equality in representation.","Keywords: geographical representation, center-periphery, legislative behavior, political selection, difference-in-differences","Frederik K.

"abstract_1085_1446_1410.html","National Attachment in the Aftermath of Brexit","Nationalism---that is, felt attachment to one's nation---plays an important role in various political behaviors.  But national identity, like other identities, is not exogenously fixed.  Instead, the literature increasingly views identity as malleable with respect to major social, political and economic events.  We explore how one such event, Brexit---one of the most significant policies affecting international integration in the United Kingdom---affected individual perceptions of national identity.  Our theoretical framework considers Brexit a polarizing event in which expressive nationalism changed in ways consistent with policy preferences on the referendum, and political identities more broadly.  To empirically understand the implications of Brexit for identity, we exploit a decade of individual-level panel data in the UK spanning both the Brexit referendum and the actual exit from the EU to evaluate how felt attachment to the British nation and its constituent nations---England, Wales and Scotland---changed.  Our results demonstrate the polarizing nature of the referendum, but also the way expressions of national attachment moderated over time, even as subsets shifted their identities toward the prototypical nationalism that corresponded to their political identities.  Our results have implications for short and medium run identity formation, the interpretation of public opinion, and the causes of attachment individuals have to global and national identities when those identities are made salient by integration and isolation policies.","Keywords: Public opinion, international political economy, nationalism, United Kingdom, Brexit","Adriane Fresh","Adriane Fresh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Duke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an increasinglyinterdependent world, politicians often confront a trade-off between theseobjectives. On the one hand, they need to adopt responsible policies that are, for instance,associated with the commitments of membership of international organizations.On the other hand, to retain office, they need to be responsive to their electorate.Recent crises – from the global recession to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the increasingmigratory flows, climate change, and security threats – have contributed toexacerbating this trade-off, paving the way for either responsive, but ineffective, measuresproposed by populist parties, or efficacious actions, mostly taken by electorallyunaccountable technocratic actors. This paper presents the results of a vignette experimentconducted among representative samples of French, German, Italian, and Spanishcitizens in 2023. Respondents were asked to evaluate responsible proposals, put forwardby a member of parliament (MP), in five policy areas that experienced recent orongoing crises. The vignettes describe scenarios that differed along seven attributes.The results indicate that approval for a responsible proposal increases in the presenceof international commitments and expert support. MP’s party cohesion over the proposal,concordance with the party’s electoral manifesto, and public opinion support alsoelicit greater approval. Interestingly, the responsible proposal also gets higher approvalratings when framed in a crisis scenario, suggesting that exogenous shocks or the usageof a crisis rhetoric can boost voters’ support for responsible policymaking.","Keywords: Crises, Vignette experiment, Responsiveness, Responsibility, Europe","Fabio Franchino","Andrea Ceron","University of Milan"," Fabio Franchino","University of Milan"," Alessandro Pellegata","University of Milan","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Milan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from a referendum campaign","A large body of research indicates that citizens rely on cues from political elites in making voting decisions in referendums. However, it is unclear whether citizens can use cues from political parties to understand what the policy alternatives in a referendum entail. In this study, we argue that citizens rely on party cues to make sense of policy questions, by drawing on the reputations of political parties. We test this argument in a two-wave survey experiment with a representative sample of Italian voters conducted during a campaign for a set of referendums in 2022. In the first wave of the panel, we use a set of indicators to descriptively show how Italian voters perceive parties’ reputations regarding the general domain of law and order. In the second wave, we implemented a survey experiment in which the respondents learned the position of the main parties on two contested referendums. We find that political parties influence voters’ reasoning about referendum issues, especially when parties support an issue (positive cues) instead of opposing an issue (negative cues). In particular, we find that voters’ interpretation of the goal of the referendums changes when they learn that two parties with different reputations take the same position (supporting the referendum). These findings have relevant implications for the role of political elites, showing how parties can contribute to public opinion formation beyond the well-studied mechanism of partisan loyalty.","Keywords: Party reputations, elite cues, policy preferences, referendums, survey experiments","Davide Morisi","Davide Morisi","University of Southern Denmark","Rune Slothuus","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern Denmark","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article addresses these questions by examining the Chilean Constitutional Convention (2021–2022), a failed experience of a constitution-making body elected after the 2019 social protests. Using a quasi-experimental design based on a difference-in-differences analysis of an original dataset of former delegates and near-winners, this study finds that former delegates are more likely to remain politically active than the control group. However, outcomes vary across the delegates' profiles: party members often escalate within political hierarchies or become advisors, while social activists face barriers to sustained engagement. This research advances the literature on the biographical outcomes of social movements by bridging the discussions on elites' political trajectories and social mobilization consequences at the individual level.","Keywords: Biographical Consequences, Social Movements Outcomes, Political Trajectories, Constitution-making Process","Joaquín Rozas-Bugueño","Joaquín Rozas-Bugueño",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Pompeu Fabra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1091_1453_0162.html","Strategic Electoral Reforms: Distorting Representation in Authoritarian Regimes.","The literature on authoritarian regimes has studied in depth why autocrats decide to hold or not hold elections. However, much less attention has been devoted to the autocrats’ electoral rule choices. This paper seeks to fill this gap by studying i) when autocrats decide to reform electoral laws, and ii) which institutional choices they take. The paper argues that the Regime's Strength and the presence of Ethnic cleavages are the main drivers of autocrats’ electoral rule choices. In particular, I argue that strong autocrats will be less prone to propose proportional reforms than weak ones, who will concede more easily to the opposition’s demands for proportionality. The presence of ethnic cleavages, in turn, will provide crucial information to the autocrat on the territorial distribution of power, thus promoting reforms that include distortive elements of representation (i.e. malapportionment and gerrymandering). To test these arguments, I leverage a novel database containing data for 117 countries and 134 reforms from 1979 to 2023. Results show that regime strength and ethnic cleavages strongly condition autocrats’ electoral rule choices. The paper has important implications for the literature on authoritarian regimes. First, it presents a novel argument for explaining the institutional decisions of autocrats. Second, it goes beyond the distinction between majoritarian and proportional reforms, focusing on whether the reforms have introduced elements that distort representation or not, allowing a better understanding of this phenomenon.","Keywords: Authoritarian Regimes.

Weexplore the political consequences of exposure to internally displaced in host communities us-ing the case of the forced evacuation of Alsatians to the French interior at the start of WWII.For identification, we leverage the fact that communes that were to receive evacuees from thefront zone, a strip of land between the Maginot Line and the French-German border, receiveda larger-than-expected number of evacuees relative to others. Increased exposure to Alsatianevacuees led to greater support for left-of-center parties after WWII. This effect is mainly drivenby a transitory drop in turnout among center-right voters. We hypothesize that this political ap-athy may be due to exposure to the costs of Nazi aggression leading voters to avoid supportingparties that may be linked to a collaborationist past. Consistent with this explanation, we finda negative effect of exposure to evacuees on the relative number of collaborators during WWIIand a more substantial impact on parties with closer ties to collaboration.","Keywords: Internal displacements, evacuations, electoral outcomes, WWII, France.","Jean Lacroix","Jean Lacroix","Universite Paris Saclay"," Ricardo Piqué","Universite Paris Saclay","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universite Paris Saclay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1093_1627_0431.html","How States Respond to Foreign Rebel Support","Under what conditions do states respond when other states support rebels against them? I develop a theoretical framework that explains when and how states retaliate against foreign rebel support. I propose that retaliation may take two primary forms: retaliatory use of force or retaliatory rebel support. Accounting for non-military responses such as inaction, condemnation, and diplomatic and economic sanctions; I argue that if states retaliate, they may either engage in covert retaliation through rebel support or overtly retaliate through the use of force. More often, states prefer retaliatory rebel support, although this choice may depend on factors such as conventional military capabilities, ethnic kinship within the adversary state, and the presence of an existing rebel group to support there. States often choose rebel support as a retaliatory strategy because it provides an effective response without directly confronting the sponsoring state. By supporting rebels, the responding state signals its willingness to retaliate if the initial support for the rebel group continues, without resorting to direct confrontation. This approach often succeeds in conveying the message, prompting the sponsoring state to withdraw support for the rebels and avoiding direct escalation. This research is one of the first to investigate retaliation against rebel support and its role as a cause of interstate conflict.","Keywords: interstate conflict, rebel support, use of force","Hilal Sert","Hilal Sert",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Georgia State UniversityThe Carter Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In medieval Europe, the castle constituted and signaled coercive power. The castle lord offered a source of protection but also constituted a threat to urban activity. We show that castle construction strongly predicts city formation, but there are no signs that the emergence of cities is followed by castle construction. We show that castle construction predicts city formation even where the geographical conditions for urban activity are poor, and that cities formed in the shadow of castles fare no worse than other cities in terms of economic activity. There is little to indicate that locally concentrated coercive power, castles, was also a threat to urban activity.

"abstract_1095_2698_0523.html","Voter Sophistication and the Responsiveness of Government Power-Sharing to Elections in Parliamentary Democracies","In parliamentary democracies, the relationship between elections and legislative agenda-setting power is precarious and indirect. Most of these democracies employ proportional electoral systems, which rarely result in a single party controlling a legislative majority. Access to agenda-setting power, controlled primarily by government ministers, must therefore be apportioned across multiple parties in a coalition government. Because elite bargaining intervenes between legislative elections and coalition formation, the allocation of ministries does not always respond to elections in normatively appealing ways. For example, incumbent government parties may gain legislative seats but lose power in government—either (1) by losing coalition membership, (2) maintaining membership but suffering losses in the share of ministries they control, or (3) maintaining membership but losing control of ministries critical to delivering policy benefits desired by their constituents. This study examines whether responsiveness through these paths occurs, and, building on Martin and Vanberg (2020, 2025), offers a theoretical argument of responsiveness based on the characteristics of party voters. Specifically, we argue that parties bargaining over coalition outcomes are constrained by the ideological sophistication of their voters: parties with more ideologically aware voters are less likely than those with less aware voters to lose those ministries that are most vital to their constituents’ policy preferences. In short, responsiveness in power-sharing depends on voter knowledge. Using a novel measure of government policy power and comprehensive data on portfolio allocation, we test our expectations using approximately 150 multiparty bargaining situations in 16 parliamentary democracies.","Keywords: legislatures, coalitions, voter sophistication","Lanny Martin","Lanny Martin","Bocconi University","Georg Vanberg","Duke University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bocconi University","Duke University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1096_1944_0658.html","Does Ballot Order Influence Election Outcomes? Evidence from 1979-2022 Portuguese Legislative Elections","Ballot order effects, whereby candidates or parties listed at the top of the ballot gain an electoral advantage, are well-documented across various majoritarian countries and electoral arenas. Yet, these effects remain relatively underexplored in proportional representation systems, particularly when party order is determined randomly. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a natural experiment in Portuguese legislative elections from 1979 to 2022, where the randomization of parties’ order on the ballot allows for the analysis of its causal effect on vote share. The dataset covers all 20 constituencies in Portugal, encompassing over four decades of electoral data. For each election and district, parties were assigned random ballot positions, offering the opportunity to isolate the effect of ballot order from other confounding factors. The findings, based on fixed-effects regression models, reveal that parties appearing at the top of the ballot achieve marginally better vote shares compared to those listed further down. This suggests that ballot order, even in proportional representation systems where party identity matters more than candidates’ visibility, can still shape voter behavior. These results highlight the need for further inquiry into how seemingly minor institutional factors, like ballot design, might influence democratic outcomes. This study not only contributes to the literature on electoral systems and voting behavior but also has potential implications for policymakers seeking to enhance electoral fairness. By showing the existence of causal ballot order effects in Portugal, it underscores the importance of randomization in mitigating structural biases.","Keywords: Ballot order, voter behavior, legislative elections, proportional representation, Portugal","Pedro Riera","Pedro Riera","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)"," Luis Azores","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this chapter, I ask if opposition local government changes how voters think about opposition parties and how likely they are to vote for opposition parties using evidence from Tanzania. I leverage interviews and survey data to show that opposition local government changes voters’ perceptions of opposition parties even if they remain loyal to the ruling party. Comparing voters living under regime and opposition local governments, I find differences in how much voters trust opposition parties, how they view the role of opposition parties in Tanzania and how likely they would be to support an opposition party.  I also leverage election data from four electoral cycles to show that opposition local control increases opposition vote at subsequent local and national elections. Furthermore, I show that support for opposition parties and favourable ideas around them diffuse around areas of opposition local control. I take advantage of temporal variation and close elections to demonstrate that these effects are not driven by selection. I contend that these results are driven by the credibility opposition parties build from governing at the local level which allows them to build support and break out of their usual constituencies.","Keywords: Authoritarianism, opposition support, political behaviour, local government","Rachael McLellan","Rachael McLellan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Glasgow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent protests against the AfD revealed ambivalent reactions from conservative leaders, raising questions about how elite endorsements affect grassroots activism. While existing research often examines the mainstream right’s importance in either facilitating or limiting the rise of the far-right, this literature is focused on electoral outcomes. We add to it by exploring how conservative elite cues shape non-electoral political mobilization against far-right movements.In the observational part, we are planning to combine longitudinal data on the partisanship of mayors of German cities and counties (obtained from Bjorn Bremer and co-authors) with longitudinal protest data to examine the effect of having a conservative mayor on the incidence of protest against the far-right.The experimental component uses an online survey experiment, currently in the field, where respondents are randomly assigned to one of five conditions: a neutral control condition, positive and negative statements about the protests (based on real-world statements), with and without a CDU/CSU cue. This design enables the study to separate the effects of message content from the influence of conservative endorsement. Key outcomes include perceived closeness to and voting intentions regarding the AfD, perception of the AfD as a threat to democracy, support for an AfD ban, likelihood of attending a protest against the AfD, interest in reading a (real) petition for an AfD ban, and intention to donate to anti-AfD organizations.","Keywords: Far-right, Protests, Mainstream Elites, Elite Cues, Germany","Fabio Ellger","Jeyhun Alizade","WZB Berlin Social Science Center"," Fabio Ellger","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"WZB Berlin Social Science Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1099_2284_0834.html","The Cordon Sanitaire as an Electoral Issue: Party Strategies in the 2025 German Election","The rise of far-right parties across Europe has forced mainstream parties to strategically position themselves toward these challengers. A common response has been the establishment of a cordon sanitaire—a strategy of isolating and excluding far-right parties from political power. However, this strategy faces growing public debate and challenges. Critics argue that exclusion radicalizes far-right parties, enhancing their outsider appeal. Additionally, hybrid media systems allow fringe parties to bypass traditional gatekeepers and directly engage broader audiences. As electoral support for far-right parties grows, the cordon sanitaire also limits coalition-building options with ideologically similar mainstream parties. At the same time, demarcation from the far right has emerged as a political mobilization tool for some parties.In contexts where the cordon sanitaire is contested, it can itself become a prominent electoral issue. We identify and distinguish three communicative strategies adopted by parties: demarcation, position blurring, and avoidance. Using large language models, we propose a novel framework to empirically identify these strategies through analysis of political texts, including party press releases and social media communication.We further develop a theoretical model explaining why parties choose specific strategies, emphasizing party positions and intra-party heterogeneity. We provide preliminary evidence from the 2025 German snap-election campaign, showing how party strategies shape the salience of the cordon sanitaire as an electoral issue and influence the attention to and portrayal of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). This research contributes to understanding how mainstream parties respond to far-right challengers and the broader implications for party competition and democratic resilience.","Keywords: party strategies, far right parties, cordon sanitaire","Theresa Gessler, Sophia Hunger","Theresa Gessler","European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)","Sophia Hunger","University of Bremen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)","University of Bremen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we examine whether governments can avoid public blame by delegating such foreign policy actions to private actors.

We test our arguments in survey experiments in the United States and Germany. In each country, we present participants with two cases of unpopular foreign policy decisions—an arms export deal with a repressive regime and a military strike with civilian casualties—and randomize whether their government engaged directly in the respective policy or engaged a private company to do so. We then assess through several variables how this affects respondents’ approval of the policy and their government.

"abstract_1103_1621_1192.html","Flooding the Feed: The Politics of Social Media Sharing Patterns among Defensive Publics","What political significance do widely-shared sources on social media carry? Efforts at documenting media content have produced useful insights about political phenomena—including right-wing populist movements that have recently been theorized as comprising defensive publics which seek to preserve centers of social, economic, and cultural power. Yet we argue patterns of sources’ visibility—not just content—also serve defensive purposes. Specifically, we conceive acts of sharing as rhetorical resources that highly-visible members of defensive publics use to mediate relationships within and across political groups. Our evidence comes from mixed-methods anaysis of 1.16 million French-language immigration-related posts on Twitter/X made between May 2020-September 2021, computationally-derived ideological embeddings of 44,810 of these users, baseline measures of the prevalence and types of hyperlinks shared by broadly politically interested French-language users beyond immigration, and 13 interviews with high-profile hard right-affiliated posters in our dataset including senior French politicians. Right- and extreme-right users are more likely than centrist or left users to engage in reposting external sources, and at significantly higher rates. Moreover, these users tend to repost both hyper-partisan sources at the extreme right as well as ones across the ideological spectrum. Sharing hyper-partisan and alternative sources redresses perceived censorship by mainstream media, while sharing mainstream sources validates some users’ views. This latter objective is enhanced by reposting sources that convey statistical evidence to signal credibility and respectability. Our results contribute novel and—in the case of the interviews—rare evidence about which sources are more visible on a globally consequential issue and the likely reasons for their persistence.","Keywords: computational methods, defensive publics, France, immigration, Twitter","William Allen","Katharina Tittel","médialab, Sciences Po Paris; Institut Convergences Migrations","William Allen","Department of Politics and International Relations (PAIR), University of Southampton","Pedro Ramaciotti Morales","médialab, Sciences Po Paris; CNRS, Complex Systems Institute of Paris Île-de-France (ISC-PIF); Learning Transitions, Learning Planet Institute, CY Cergy University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","médialab, Sciences Po Paris","Institut Convergences Migrations","Department of Politics and International Relations (PAIR), University of Southampton","CNRS, Complex Systems Institute of Paris Île-de-France (ISC-PIF)","Learning Transitions, Learning Planet Institute, CY Cergy University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1105_1632_1319.html","Electoral system and geographical representation","The importance of geographical representation has been highlighted for a variety of Western democracies. A growing number of single-country studies emphasize that parliamentarians use parliamentary instruments to signal effort to geographic areas, either to secure re-election or to highlight their representational priorities to social groups. However, while these studies often stress the impact of electoral institutions, a comparative analysis is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effects of different electoral systems through a comparative analysis of parliamentary questions from the UK House of Commons, the French National Assembly, the German Bundestag, and the Dutch Tweede Kamer. By incorporating diverse political contexts, this study is the first to analyze geographical representation from a cross-country perspective. The findings suggest that geographical representation is less prevalent in proportional representation (PR) and party-centered systems, where party discipline and collective agendas take precedence. In contrast, politicians in majoritarian electoral systems – and thus candidate-centered systems – have strong incentives to emphasize their efforts toward their constituencies. However, the results also show that MPs in party-centered systems may still engage in geographical representation to consolidate support in their electoral strongholds and in competitive districts.","Keywords: Geographical Representation, Electoral Systems, Western Europe","Morten Harmening Harmening","Morten Harmening Harmening",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Leibniz University Hannover",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the importance of self-categorization into these lower or higher order territorial units, we still know very little about the contextual and individual characteristics driving these identities, as well as about their prevalence.In this study, we leverage data from the latest wave of the World Values Survey (WVS), conducted between 2017 and 2022 across 66 countries. For the first time, the WVS consistently asked respondents about their feeling of closeness to local, regional, national, and world communities, allowing us to present novel descriptive findings on this subject.

When large numbers of individuals or interest groups from their districts oppose a proposed rule, MCs are more likely to i) publicly criticize the agency on social media, ii) privately seek information through informal communications, and iii) summon agency officials to testify before congressional committees.

As the size of this population continues to grow, its impact on the politics of both the countries of origin and destination remains a crucial area of inquiry in the 21st Century. While scholars have recently devoted considerable attention to questions of why governments extend voting rights to citizens abroad, little to no work has investigated (a) whether expatriate votes actually matter and, perhaps more importantly, (b) how differently do expatriates behave politically than their countrymen whom they left behind? In this paper, we leverage the Lebanese government's decision to allow expatriates to vote from abroad in 2022 parliamentary elections to address these questions. Since Lebanon's electoral system conducts elections in localized geographic districts, requires expatriates to vote in those districts (as if they still lived there), and disaggregates expatriate votes at the district level by the countries in which they are voting from, we have a unique data set to explore these questions. The answers to them are quite stark. In Lebanon's 2022 elections, expatriates were able to shift the outcome of around 10 out of 128 parliamentary seats. Moreover, Lebanese expatriate voters were much more likely to vote like other Lebanese in their new locales than those who remained behind.","Keywords: expatriate voting, middle eastern politics, political economy of development","Adam Ramey","Adam Ramey",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"New York University Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To rule out alternative explanations such as the selection of poll workers to ex-ante riskier areas, more vigilance exerted by more suspicious poll workers and “overinterpretation” of evidence driven by stereotypes, we fielded an experiment to the same poll workers where they evaluated hypothetical scenarios that were either perfectly legal, ambiguous, or unequivocally fraudulent  Beliefs about fraud had a similar impact on perception as observing actual violations, questioning the reliability of survey-based measures of election fraud.","Keywords: election fraud; motivated reasoning; survey experiment; Hungary","Gabor Simonovits","Attila Gaspar","HUN REN","Gabor Simonovits","Central European University; HUN REN","Andrea Szabo","HUN REN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Central European University","HUN REN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1112_0414_0430.html","Fame or Folly? Credit Claiming in the Age of Publicity and Surveillance","Terrorist organizations leverage communication technologies and credit claiming to intimidate enemies, rally supporters, and coordinate operatives. However, could these same technologies and tactics also undermine the groups’ longevity? While terrorists use communication strategies for impact, governments harness these same technologies to identify and target perpetrators of terrorism. This paper investigates how communication technology interacts with credit claiming to influence terrorist group survival. We hypothesize that groups frequently claiming credit for attacks are less likely to persist, especially in states with advanced communication infrastructures. Although a high-caliber communication environment may entice groups to attack for publicity, frequently claiming credit for attacks can simultaneously imperil their survival in such contexts. Using data from 409 terrorist organizations, drawn from the Extended Data on Terrorist Groups (EDTG), the Global Terrorism Database, and the KOF Index of Information, we empirically test our hypothesis. Our findings contribute to literature on the consequences of credit claims for the fates of terrorist groups, as well as to the broader scholarship on the media-terrorism nexus, highlighting how the quest for publicity can shoot terrorist groups in the proverbial foot.","Keywords: terrorist organizations, media-terrorism nexus, publicity and credit, communication technology, terrorist survival","Nazli Avdan, Aaron Hoffman","Nazli Avdan","University of Kansas","Aaron Hoffman","Simon Fraser University","Ilayda Onder","Texas A& M University (TAMU)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Kansas","Simon Fraser University","Texas A& M University (TAMU)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1113_2578_0296.html","The alignment of the constitutional value space in Scotland","Scotland’s two constitutional questions have emerged around two distinct, cross-cutting value cleavages. Research shows that voting in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum was largely driven by economic left-right values, but only loosely associated with libertarian-authoritarian ones; whilst the opposite has been shown with regards to value orientations in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In this paper I investigate how this has since changed. Using a longitudinal mediation model on 25 waves of BESIP data (2014-2023), I show how two dormant electoral faultlines, libertarian-authoritarian values in the case of independence and left-right values in the case of Brexit, were activated as positions on the two constitutional questions have become increasingly aligned. As a result, both independence and Brexit positions are now driven by an interaction of the economic and cultural value cleavages in Scotland, with voters on the libertarian-left more likely to support independence and oppose Brexit, and voters on the authoritarian-right to oppose independence and favour of Brexit. These findings make some important contributions to two fields of study. First, they engage with literature on  changing electoral cleavages and alignments by shedding light on the mechanisms through which socio-demographic and value differences can gain electoral significance when the issues to which they are associated rise in salience. Second, the Scottish case lends itself to comparisons with other separatist regions and nations where an independence movement largely driven by left-right values either cross-cuts or aligns with the question of EU integration - such as Wales, Northern Ireland, Catalonia, Flanders and Corsica.","Keywords: Secession referendums, value orientations, Scotland, Brexit","Marta Miori","Marta Miori",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1115_1202_1513.html","Increasing Election Confidence and Satisfaction In Democracy: Encouraging New Election Workers Causes Increased Confidence in Elections","Can direct experience with administering elections increase confidence in elections? Many democracies face lack of confidence and increased dissatisfaction with democracy. I theorize that voters who have less direct experience witnessing the administration of elections are more likely to believe election conspiracies and have reduced confidence that ballot counts are accurate. One way to solve this problem is to encourage more rank-and-file voters to become election workers administering the election (registering voters, counting ballots, and so on).  I test this with a research study embedded in the United States, in the swing state of Arizona.  The study was conducted in partnership with the Arizona Secretary of State’s office.  Registered voters were recruited to participate in a Fellows program placing them as workers in election offices administering the election; and compared to a control group who did not participate.  Survey outcomes at the beginning of the program and survey outcomes at the conclusion of the program are compared to a panel study of control group respondents.  Preliminary evidence shows that those who participated in administering the elections had significantly higher trust in democracy and confidence in the election outcomes. The conclusion is that bringing new voters directly into the process of administering elections can have spillover effects that encourage greater confidence in elections and reduce polarization.","Keywords: elections, election confidence, poll workers, democracy, trust in elections","Christian Grose","Christian Grose",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that compulsory military service—a central state institution—can depolarize voters because it prevents early partisan sorting and increases the likelihood of contact between partisans during their impressionable years. Leveraging the staggered abolition of mandatory conscription laws in fifteen European countries and employing a regression discontinuity design, I show that men exempt from mandatory conscription report higher levels of affective polarization than men who were subject to mass conscription. This effect is mainly driven by partisan parochialism among men exempt from service and is unrelated to ideological change. My findings emphasize the potential depolarizing effects of state institutions and illustrate how the abolition of mandatory service contributed to intensified patterns of affective polarization in Europe, contributing to the literature on the institutional origins of affective polarization.","Keywords: Polarization, Institutions, Conscription, Regression Discontinuity Design","Chagai Weiss","Chagai Weiss",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates why political parties adopt anti-pluralist positions, drawing on evidence from one of the most notorious cases of uncivil politics, the Weimar Republic. Through a supervised text analysis of a novel corpus of party programmes and election manifestos of all electorally relevant political parties in the Weimar Republic, I map variation in anti-pluralist positions over time and across parties. I also analyse whether the adoption of anti-pluralist positions was related to various party characteristics and context conditions. The results indicate that the adoption of anti-pluralist positions was mainly driven by parties’ ideology and electoral competition from more extremist parties, especially on the political right. Qualitative historical evidence suggests that changes in party leadership was a crucial element in the mechanism linking electoral failure to the adoption of antipluralist positions.","Keywords: Antipluralism, Weimar Republic, electoral competition, party manifestos, party leadership","Frank Häge","Frank Häge",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Limerick",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Exploring the network of pro-Russian and far-right anti-gender messaging via Telegram","Russian anti-gender messaging has been identified as a key ingredient of Russian propaganda (Edenborg 2023). While Russian propaganda is known to reflect already existing rifts in societies abroad, recent research also suggests that far-right parties take inspiration from Russian propaganda tactics and narratives (Wilson 2023). However, the overlap of Russian and far-right anti-gender messaging networks remains understudied. This paper therefore seeks to explore the connections of Russian anti-gender messaging with far-right messaging, and its key topics over time. Inspired by authoritarian learning literature (Hall and Ambrosio 2017), it investigates the potential ‘illiberal learning’ of right-wing actors. Representing a key venue of Russian propaganda (Oleinik 2023), public Telegram channels are analysed. To recreate the network of Russian anti-gender propaganda, the five key Russian propaganda Telegram channels, including RT (Kireev et al. 2024), are scraped with the Telegram API, and serve as a seed-set. For snowball-sampling, a keyword dictionary is used to identify anti-gender specific forwards to other Telegram channels and external links. Community detection is then applied to separate the channels into groups of nodes (Urman and Katz 2022). The political position of channels is coded on a left-right axis, based on reference to political parties and news websites, combined with sentiment analysis. Lastly, structural topic modeling is used to compare the similarities and differences in anti-gender messaging of the most central pro-Russian with the most central right-wing channels over time (Zehring and Domahidi 2023). Overall, this study contributes to understanding the reinforcing dynamic of pro-Russian and far-right anti-gender messaging.","Keywords: Propaganda, gender, illiberalism, Russia, Telegram","Martha Stolze","Martha Stolze",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Weizenbaum Institute e.V., Free University Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1120_1179_1198.html","Food for Thought: When cultural agents turn to politics during wartime","Conflicts often trigger unique information flows, potentially fostering political awareness and engagement among previously disengaged citizens. This study explores this phenomenon in the context of social media, examining how previously apolitical actors leveraged food-related content to share political messages following the most recent outbreak of violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Utilizing a novel dataset of millions of popular cooking-related posts and comments from before and after October 7th, 2023, we find evidence that cultural ambassadors are galvanized by conflict into political activism. We document a sharp shift in social media content among accounts with cultural ties to the conflict: previously apolitical accounts begin to blend political messages with their more typical food-focused content at high rates. We further uncover striking patterns in the level of commenter engagement. Messages mixing cultural and political messages generate significantly higher engagement than strictly apolitical content and reach a larger and more diverse audience. This effect is particularly pronounced for chefs whose ethnic identity aligns with the conflict's key players. Yet this broader outreach comes with tradeoffs: 'going political' actually reduces engagement with previously loyal followers. The act of turning food content into political messaging highlights the amorphous boundaries between personal and political in the modern media environment and reveals a new channel for broadcasting information to a public that increasingly tunes out of traditional news.","Keywords: conflict, political messaging, information dissemination, social media, activism","Eunji Kim","Eunji Kim","Columbia University","Erin York","Vanderbilt University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vanderbilt University","Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1121_2199_1318.html","Defining the Local: How Economic Shocks Influence Economic Concerns and Political Views","Growing evidence suggests that deteriorating local economic conditions contribute to the rise of anti-establishment parties. However, current research does not yet fully understand the nuanced processes through which economic shocks lead to individual precarity, potentially translating into economic concerns and political grievances. We contend that `socio-spatial' factors critically influence individuals' awareness and concerns about the local economy, specifically through (a) spatial proximity (distance to an event) and (b) social proximity (diffusion through interpersonal networks). These factors constitute a reconceptualization of economic shocks as ‘layered,’ taking into account personal and geographical proximity to layoffs as well as the sectoral composition of the layoffs. Combining an original geocoded panel data survey in the UK with event data on economic shocks, we investigate individual-level responses to layoffs in terms of labor market perceptions and other social and political preferences. Our results show that local economic shocks robustly predict job market risk perceptions. These effects are stronger when the layoffs occur within the affected workers' own industry. Such within-industry local economic shocks lead to a more pessimistic outlook regarding perceptions of financial circumstances and changes in redistributive preferences. The results suggest that a more detailed examination of spatial and social proximity to economic shocks improves our understanding of how local economic decline leads to economic precariousness and shapes perceptions and political attitudes.","Keywords: restructuring, local economy, industry, political change","Pedro Martín-Cadenas","Pedro Martín-Cadenas","European University Institute","Valentina Consiglio","University of Konstanz; University of Zurich","Thomas Kurer","University of Konstanz; University of Zurich","Kattalina Berriochoa","University of Konstanz","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","University of Konstanz","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Not only do national borders play a large role in European political and cultural exchange, but so do sub-national divisions. Scholarship on policy and political attitudes is increasingly concerned with how citizens perceive this fragmentation of the societal structures in which they are embedded, and whether they support the almost-federalisation of multiple competences in European society. Mediators have been found to be political socialisation of new generations, party affiliation or regional wealth, amongst others.My research contributes to this field of policy feedback and public opinion by analysing attitudes towards regionalisation and federalisation from a historically contextual, transgenerational perspective. It thus speaks directly to the increasingly individual-focused, longitudinal studies regarding mass publics and their feedback effects. The study follows the question 'How do citizens of different states experience and conceptualise (further) regionalisation?'. It compares two European, (quasi-)federal countries: Spain and Belgium. Both states share the existence of multiple distinct national identities within the territory, as well as conflictual policy relations between regions.The comparison focuses on two regions in each country (Madrid-Catalonia; Wallonia-Flanders) to control for linguistic and cultural identification as well as political socialisation. The methods are interviews of a random, stratified sample of citizens, to better understand their perception of regionalisation and how it interacts with matters of regional identity, national and linguistic history, as well as family dynamics and transgenerational divides.","Keywords: federalism, regionalisation, citizen preferences, cross-country, comparative","Lorena Ortiz Cabrero","Lorena Ortiz Cabrero",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UCLouvain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1123_1614_1418.html","When Disaster Strikes: How Ideology and Partisanship Shape Responsibility Attribution in Multilevel Governance","In the aftermath of a natural disaster, how do citizens determine the appropriate level of government to which responsibility should be attributed? Accountability in decentralized systems is hindered due to citizens' limited understanding of the specific responsibilities assigned to each level of government, even when formal competencies are clearly defined. Furthermore, this situation becomes more complicated by ideological positions and partisan cues, which act as shortcuts in citizens’ evaluations of government performance. Even greater complexity is to be expected in polarized environments, as has been the case in Spanish politics during recent years. While previous studies have predominantly focused on responsibility attribution within the context of policies, less attention has been paid to extraordinary events such as natural disasters, where multiple levels of government often intervene concurrently. This paper investigates how Spanish citizens evaluate government performance and assign responsibility to different levels of government (autonomous, central, and local) following the DANA crisis, which primarily affected the Valencian Community. Using original data from a nationally representative survey, we analyze the extent to which ideology and partisan identification influence these perceptions. The preliminary findings indicate that these factors significantly shape both the evaluation of crisis management and the attribution of responsibility to specific levels of government.","Keywords: Responsibility Attribution, Decentralized Systems, Natural Disasters","Juan Antonio Rodríguez-Zepeda","Patricia Otero-Felipe","University of Burgos"," Juan Antonio Rodríguez-Zepeda","University of Burgos"," Leonardo Sánchez Ferrer","University of Burgos","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Burgos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Testing the Effect of Social Group Appeals on British Voters’ Party Preferences","This study examines how political parties’ rhetorical appeals to social groups affect voters’ party preferences. Parties regularly appeal to social groups in their political communications, often pairing these appeals with policy promises. Yet, existing models of voting behavior focus almost exclusively on the role of policies. I use a pre-registered conjoint experiment fielded on a nationally representative sample of British adults in August 2024 that has voters consider parties’ promises to social groups in four different issue areas: Health, Housing, Environment, and the Economy. Across all issues, I find no evidence that parties gain support from using group appeals. Rather, voters punish parties who explicitly appeal to groups they do not belong to, do not like, or do not consider important. Appeals to women, therefore, tend to get punished, whereas appeals to workers have a more neutral effect on party favorability. I also find that the detected backlash is not driven by out-group members, but by those who do not consider the group important. These findings shed light on the role of group attitudes, beyond just identity, in explaining vote choice and advance our understanding of the consequences of group appeals.","Keywords: group appeals, representation, conjoint","Timea Balogh","Timea Balogh",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of California, Davis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1125_1294_1572.html","Oligarchic Networks of Influence and Legislatures in Developing Democracies: Evidence from Ukraine","State capture by wealthy elites is a widespread phenomenon in developing democracies, yet the mechanisms through which it works and the impact it has on political and policy outcomes remain poorly understood. I develop an innovative, network-based approach to studying captured legislatures and argue that, in the context of a competitive political environment and weak rule of law, oligarchs defend their wealth by promoting as members of parliament individuals who are linked to them via interpersonal ties. Through their networks of loyal legislators, oligarchs influence the adoption of policies and decisions related to their economic interests, as well as policymaking more broadly. To develop and test these arguments, I rely on social network and regression analyses of original quantitative data and interview-based evidence on the case of Ukraine.More specifically, I uncover the hidden networks of interpersonal connections between oligarchs and legislators by employing a network-based measurement strategy on 137 oligarchs and more than 800 legislators across two parliamentary convocations (2014-2019, 2019-2024) and utilizing unique administrative and investigative data. I then use regression analyses on roll-call voting data and expert-coded data on reforms to show that these oligarchic networks of loyal legislators push against anti-corruption reforms and influence legislative voting more broadly. The study has important implications for the literatures on money in politics, oligarchy, state capture, crony capitalism, political connections, neopatrimonialism, legislative politics, political parties, and political representation.","Keywords: oligarchs, state capture, political connections, legislatures","Silviya Nitsova","Silviya Nitsova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1126_0043_0170.html","Public support for digital taxation in Africa","Access to mobile payment platforms across Africa has boomed in recent years, offering financial services to hundreds of millions without conventional bank accounts. Mobile transactions were worth more than 600 billion USD in 2022 alone, presenting policymakers with a substantive new source of domestic revenue. Many African governments have now placed levies on mobile payment platforms to help fund public services, but these have triggered widespread backlash from citizens in ways that risk undermining tax morale and the broader welfare gains of mobile money. In this project I examine how policymakers might resolve this trade-off, using a) observational analysis from across the continent to study the impact of taxes on public opinion, and b) a conjoint policy choice experiment in Malawi to study the types of transaction tax able to garner public support.In my experiment, which is currently in the field (Oct 2024), respondents are presented with hypothetical mobile money tax policies and asked which they would prefer. Each policy has five features, the levels of which are randomised. Drawing on existing literature and my own research, I focus on several features likely to be relevant: the tax rate, payment exemptions, earmarking of revenues, monitoring, and mode of collection. These highlight various aspects of taxation, like the direct cost imposed on citizens, concerns about government corruption, and the public services that taxpayers receive from the state in return for their taxes. I anticipate that partisanship, and perceptions of reciprocity (gains from taxation) will be important determinants of support.","Keywords: Mobile money; Public opinion; Tax morale; State capacity; Africa","Alex Yeandle","Alex Yeandle",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"London School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1127_0832_0460.html","Costly Choices: Examining the Hidden Costs of Supporting Corrupted Politicans in Survey  Experiments","While the negative consequences of corruption are widely acknowledged, citizens often dismiss or overlook fraudulent or suspicious cases of public fund abuse. In a meta-review, Incerti (2020) finds that although respondents express strong disapproval of corrupt candidates in survey experiments, corrupt candidates are, on average, penalized by zero percentage points in field experiments. This raises a critical question: how can survey experiments be made more representative of real-world voting behavior? This paper takes a first step toward addressing this gap by examining individuals' sensitivity to the costs of voting for a corrupt versus a clean in-party candidate. I hypothesize that while respondents generally dislike corrupt candidates, they may tolerate some level of corruption if switching to an honest candidate incurs significant costs. I categorize these costs into four types: (1) cognitive costs of updating beliefs about a known candidate; (2) personal and ideological costsassociated with increasing the out-party’s chances of winning; (3) social desirability costs tied to revealing support for corrupt politicians; and (4) conformity costs related to deviating from widely accepted norms.To quantify individuals' sensitivity to these costs, I employ an incentive experiment that modifies the multi-arm design used by Janas et al. (2024), adapting it into a single-vignette conjoint design. The experiment randomly varies four factors—each corresponding to one of the four types of costs. By quantifying the real-world costs associated with punishing corruption, this project addresses a critical gap in the literature and provides new insights into the mechanisms driving voter tolerance for corrupt politicians.","Keywords: corruption, experiment, hypocrisy","Alberto Stefanelli","Alberto Stefanelli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1129_0088_0774.html","The “second dimension” in Central Europe: a demand-side approach","This article examines the issue content of the “second dimension” of political competition on the demand side of politics in Central Europe. The traditional two-dimensional space, characterised by economic and cultural dimensions, has been transformed in recent decades, but there is no agreement on the issue content of the cultural dimension. Some argue that the second dimension revolves primarily around cultural liberalism. In contrast, others say that it is primarily driven by globalisation and transnationalism and revolves around issues of immigration and EU integration. This article uses the European Values Study countries to investigate the issue content of the second dimension. It focuses on four issues: immigration, EU, gender, and environment. Using factor analysis, Mokken scale analysis, and regression analysis, it is found that the four issues load on the same factors and do not create a single coherent scale. Attitudes towards the four issues are also differently related to the radical right party support. The analysis of the relationship between individual attitudes towards the four issues and citizens’ preferences for radical right parties suggests that the second dimension in the region primarily revolves around immigration and EU issues. The article, therefore, suggests that the four issues should not be bundled together and that they do not form a single second dimension on the demand side of politics in Central Europe.","Keywords: immigration, gender, environment, EU, second dimension, citizens, radical right","Jan Kovář","Jan Kovář",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute of International Relations Prague",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1130_1108_0266.html","Industrialization, Representation, and Fiscal Development: Evidence from US States between 1870 to 1910","Political economy scholars have long emphasized the fundamental role of industrialization and the resulting interplay between declining rural elites and the emerging urban class in shaping trajectories of public spending and taxation. Using both cross-national and within-country designs, prior research has found that urbanization augments the size and capacity of the state, increases fiscal decentralization, and raises the share of taxes shouldered by the rising urban sector. However, the factors that underlie elite strategic decisions regarding whether to invest in fiscal capacity, shift the tax burden, or opt for tax decentralization have received relatively limited exploration. We investigate this question using an original and comprehensive annual dataset of American state- and county-level tax and public spending data from 1870 to 1910, a period marked by rapid industrialization. We argue that the strategies chosen by elites to fund essential public goods and manage tax burdens were contingent on the pace of industrialization and the degree to which rural elites could shape political institutions in each state. Not only do the late 19th and early 20th-century American states exhibit substantial variation across economic dimensions, they also varied in the extent to which the rules governing the allocation of political power across states favored rural constituencies. This, in turn, influenced the extent to which state taxes could be shifted to urban areas. Therefore, this setting provides an exceptional opportunity to explore and evaluate various competing hypotheses within the comparative political economy literature regarding the determinants of taxation and public spending.","Keywords: state building, fiscal capacity, industrialization","Jeffrey Jensen","Jeffrey Jensen","NYU Abu Dhabi"," Giuliana Pardelli","NYU Abu Dhabi"," Jeffrey Timmons","NYU Abu Dhabi","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"NYU Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Aspiring autocrats in countries like Poland, Hungary or Israel have weakened the powers of the courts vis-à-vis the executive, and they have usually done so in the name of popular sovereignty. This paper explores the tension between the rule of law and popular sovereignty from the perspective of citizens. Are citizens willing to accept the constraints on popular sovereignty imposed by the rule of law through horizontal accountability mechanisms and judicial independence? Under what circumstances are voters willing to trade off the rule of law for more popular sovereignty? We explore these questions through an original pre-registered observational study in 15 European countries that introduces innovative measurement strategies aimed at evaluating citizens’ views of the democratic trade-off between popular sovereignty and the rule of law. This evidence is complemented with a pre-registered conjoint experiment on judicial review fielded in four of these countries. The results reveal that instrumental considerations and affective polarization are the key factors that make citizens more open to trading off the rule of law for popular sovereignty. This paper contributes to current debates on democratic backsliding by advancing our knowledge about how citizens view the delicate balance between increasingly contested democratic principles such as popular sovereignty and the rule of law.","Keywords: Democracy, backsliding, political attitudes, affective polarization, rule of law","Sergi Ferrer","Enrique Hernández","Autonomous University of Barcelona"," Sergi Ferrer","Autonomous University of Barcelona"," Damjan Tomic","Autonomous University of Barcelona"," Enrique Prada","Autonomous University of Barcelona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Autonomous University of Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1132_0770_0666.html","Institutional and Discursive Norm Violations in Electoral Campaigns: Exploring Direct and Cumulative Effects","Previous studies reveal that while undemocratic behavior may be slightly punished by party supporters (Carey et al. 2022), most voters prefer a co-partisan who violates democratic norms over a rival candidate loyal to such norms (Frederiksen 2024; Graham and Svolik 2020; Krishnarajan 2022). Despite this progress, we still know little about the impact of different types of norms or whether discursive, rather than institutional, violations influence voters. The relationship between norm transgression and its intensity also remains unclear. For example, would voters respond differently to a candidate exerting pressure on media freedom by criticizing journalists versus one openly declaring plans to shut down a media outlet? This study investigates whether voters, in a multidimensional electoral choice, punish violations of institutional norms (e.g., electoral integrity, media freedom) and discursive norms (e.g., truth, civility, representative thinking). It examines how these transgressions compare to classic predictors of vote choice, such as partisanship and policy congruence, and explores whether combinations of discursive norm violations amplify their impact. We will also compare sub-groups of voters (e.g., populist, technocrat, and party-democrat) to assess how attitudes toward representative democracy influence reactions to norm violations.

It explores whether ECs are perceived as a last resort by individuals dissatisfied with domestic political and judicial systems. We focus on two key dimensions: 1) institutional satisfaction and 2) individuals’ position within the political and social system. Drawing on theories of trust in international courts and the role of ECs in addressing domestic failures, we hypothesize that distrust in national governments and courts enhances support for ECs. We investigate how dissatisfaction with domestic democracy and the rule of law influences trust in ECs and whether disadvantage groups in the political system perceive ECs as safeguards against domestic injustices. Using survey data conducted in Denmark, France, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, we analyze cross-country differences in trust and legitimacy. Our findings highlight how ECs serve as vital institutions for groups marginalized or dissatisfied with domestic systems, offering insights into the broader implications for judicial governance and the future of liberal values in Europe.","Keywords: European Courts, trust, democracy, minorities, rule of law, judicial politics.","Juan Antonio Mayoral, Mikael Rask Madsen","Juan Antonio Mayoral","University Carlos III of Madrid","Mikael Rask Madsen","University of Copenhagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University Carlos III of Madrid","University of Copenhagen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While much is known about how globalisation, trade shocks, and automation generate political backlash among rural communities, the political implications of the green transition—these rapid, government-driven policies that disproportionately impact carbon-intensive, often rural, communities—remain underexplored. We focus on the 2019 Dutch court ruling that mandated stringent environmental measures to address nitrogen surpluses near natural habitats, predominantly affecting agriculture in rural municipalities. Using comprehensive administrative data and panel survey data, we analyse the ruling’s impact on political backlash, measured through radical right support, political distrust, political inefficacy, and dissatisfaction with politicians. Our difference-in-differences analysis reveal that rural areas and individuals adversely affected by the ruling are more inclined to support radical right parties after the ruling, suggesting a greenlash. Our panel survey data explore the place-based economic, cultural and political grievances that drive this greenlash. By generating patterns of radical right support similar to those seen with globalisation, trade shocks, and automation, the green transition emerges as a new structural change with concerning political implications that exacerbate the urban-rural divide.","Keywords: Environmental policies, climate politics, radical right voting, urban-rural divide","Diane Bolet","Diane Bolet","University of Essex","Sven Hegewald","ETH Zurich","Tarik Abou-Chadi","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Essex","ETH Zurich","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what explains these changes and how they might vary across time, party type, party size, and party family. In this project, we seek to fill this gap and undertake the first cross-national longitudinal analysis of party logo changes.  To do so, we use a new original dataset of party logo changes from 18 Western European countries spanning 1980-2022.

We generally find support for these hypotheses, with leader change and vote loss having the strongest predictive effects.

The findings suggest there are few instances, if ever, closed-ended responses are preferable to open-ended responses.

Given voters no longer seem to hold an outright preference for men or women, we ask: how is gender used as a heuristic in voter decision-making? We aim to discern whether voters support women simply because they are women or because they make gender-based assumptions about women’s policy platforms. To address this, we field a novel experiment where we vary whether respondents are provided with information only about politicians’ descriptive characteristics, substantive issue priorities, or both. Consistent with past work, we find that voters prefer women to men, but that they no longer hold outright gendered preferences once provided with information on politicians’ policy priorities. Our research contributes to understanding how politicians’ descriptive characteristics continue to influence voters’ decisions when electing political representatives.","Keywords: descriptive representation, substantive representation, women, politics, conjoint experiment","Eleanor Woodhouse, Lotte Hargrave","Eleanor Woodhouse","University College London","Lotte Hargrave","University of Manchester","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University College London","University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although political apathy and skepticism of traditional authorities are prevalent among young adults, social media influencers (SMIs) can and do capture their attention. Whether these often-frivolous yet engaging and trusted actors have enduring effects on the policy and political values, substantive and affective attitudes, and behaviors is an important open question. This online field experiment investigates the impact of encouraging Americans aged between 18 and 45 to expose themselves to five months of content produced by five SMIs of potential interest on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube. We consider two variants of this treatment condition: (i) largely apolitical SMIs periodically producing progressive content as part of the Better Internet Initiative's fellows program; and (ii) political SMIs regularly producing news and political content from a progressive perspective. We further vary encouragement to follow assigned SMIs, cross-randomizing whether participants receive just recommendations, recommendations, and a small financial incentive to follow an account or recommendations and larger quiz-based incentives. The comparison between these treatment conditions, as well as with a pure control and several placebo groups, promises to illuminate how encouraged exposure to follow progressively-minded SMIs shapes the degree to which individuals engage with and are ultimately persuaded by this new mode of political information on social media.","Keywords: social media; field experiment; influencers","Eunji Kim","Kirill Chmel","Columbia University"," Eunji Kim","Columbia University"," John Marshall","Columbia University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1140_0272_1497.html","Unpacking the Impact of Rising Immigration on Voting Behavior: Labor Market Competition in the Absence of Social Integration","The paper studies effects of labor market competition with immigrants, net from other long-term contextual factors. While many studies distinguish between exposure to immigrants and direct contact with them, few have been able to isolate the specific effects of labor market competition when social and economic integration is absent. Labor economists have found that a sudden influx of immigrants can have negative short-term effects on employment and wages, although these effects can be reversed when immigrants boost demand and contribute to the local economy. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining the central question: How does labor market competition affect political outcomes when immigrants are socially and economically non-integrated?I argue that many empirical studies conflate the short- and long-term effects of immigration, which can obscure negative reactions of workers directly exposed to labor market competition. To investigate this, I examine a unique immigration shock that occurred in Germany in 1991. Concretely, a policy was implemented that allowed Czech workers to commute to jobs in Germany without granting them residency rights. This allows me to isolate the effects of labor market competition without considering other long-run countervailing factors. Since only municipalities in the border with the Czech Republic were affected, I use a (synthetic) difference-in-differences approach. Doing so I analyze how municipalities affected by this policy voted in the 1994 election compared to other municipalities that were not affected. To investigate possible mechanisms, I use the German Socio-Economic Panel, showing an increase perception of job loss risk.","Keywords: Labor market competition, Immigration shock, Electoral outcomes, Subjective insecurity, Difference-in-differences","Josep Serrano-Serrat","Josep Serrano-Serrat",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1141_0754_1209.html","STRATCOM Voter perceptions of ambiguous party issue positions","Position blurring/ambiguity is a strategy that some parties adopt to appeal broadly to a diverse group of voters. Recent research suggests that the strategy may help parties win elections, especially if the parties can convince voters that they are closer to their preferred position. What we still do not know, however, is how voters perceive ambiguous parties’ issue positions. Following the projection literature, we argue that ambiguity exacerbates the effects of subjective party affinity on how close and distant voters perceive political parties. While we know that voters perceive parties they like as closer to them and those they dislike as more distant than where the parties are (assimilation and contrast effects), we argue that these effects are especially strong for those parties who adopt ambiguous issue positions and especially on issues that respondents personally find highly important.  We test our expectations using an original cross-national survey with both citizens and experts across ten advanced democracies that asks both groups of respondents their perceptions of party positions on the left-right scale and on six issues (covering both economic and social issues), party like-dislike evaluations of citizens, and personal issue salience.","Keywords: ambiguity, projection effects, perceptions of party positions","Zeynep Somer-Topcu","Zeynep Somer-Topcu","University of Texas at Austin","Patrick Fournier","University of Montreal","Ruth Dassonneville","KU Leuven","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Texas at Austin","University of Montreal","KU Leuven",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Criminal Governance, Public Goods and Migration: Evidence from Mexico and Latin America","Existing research on the political economy of international migration often assumes that emigration and remittances result from the state’s inability to provide quality public goods, including security, and that non-state actors, like  organised crime groups (OCGs), inherently oppose state authority. However, OCGs do not always act in opposition to the state, in many cases, they collaborate with authorities to achieve shared objectives. Criminal governance can therefore take various forms, some of them can be peaceful and economically prosperous. Yet, scholars have thus far investigated how (criminal) violence shapes emigration decisions or the political behaviour of remittances recipients. The study provides new insights into the political economy of international migration by distinguishing different criminal governance scenarios. We employ municipal-level data from Mexico and distinguish between different types of OCG presence, whether monopolistic or competitive, as well as competing and collaborative relationships between OCGs and the state. Using panel models with difference-in-differences regression, we examine how different criminal governance scenarios relate to emigration rates in a municipality, as well as tax collection and public goods spending in migrant-sending communities. We complement the analysis with survey data from 18 Latin American countries, and examine how the presence of OCGs and their role in public service provision in respondents’ neighborhoods relates to their emigration intentions, as well as the satisfaction with public goods and support for taxation of those with members living abroad.","Keywords: criminal governance, migration, taxation, public goods, Mexico, Latin America","Ana Isabel Lopez Garcia","Ana Isabel Lopez Garcia",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Maastricht",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While malapportionment is widely regarded as the leading cause of partisan bias—where equal parties are not treated equally—we argue that electoral magnitude variance has an equally significant, if not greater, role in producing such bias. Magnitude variance, akin to gerrymandering in uniform single-member districts, influences vote efficiency. A positive correlation between magnitude and electoral support leads to wasted votes, while a negative correlation enables more efficient vote allocation. To test these propositions, we evaluate the effects of both malapportionment and magnitude variance using simulated and real data. Using Spain as a case study, we demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, variance in electoral magnitude is the primary driver of conservative party bias in the system.","Keywords: Partisan bias, Malapportionment, Electoral magnitude variance, vote efficiency","Jose M Pavia, Alberto Penades","Jose M Pavia","Universitat de Valencia","Alberto Penades","Universidad de Salamanca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat de Valencia","Universidad de Salamanca",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Why are individuals more likely to accept or reject disaster guidelines that may contradict their political outlooks? Previous research on motivated reasoning finds that individuals are less likely to learn from data that contradicts their prior beliefs compared to congenial data, even among individuals highest in numeracy—a measure of the ability to make use of quantitative information. This paper asks whether individual differences in the motivation to engage in effortful cognitive thinking (NFC or Need For Cognition) is the likely mechanism that explains how individuals process uncongenial data. In the US, the issue of masking in public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic generated a partisan divide in public opinion. We find via an experiment that involves data interpretation tasks on the effectiveness of masking that those high in NFC, as opposed to NFA (Need For Affect), are more likely to exhibit motivated reasoning when interpreting uncongenial data. The experiment was fielded online with adult US residents in the spring of 2021, when the issue of mask mandates was highly salient and politicized.

In many countries, the power to site these are in the hands of local governments. Yet, we know little about how this political decentralization shapes the siting of renewable energy developments. Building on the premise that local politicians are responsive to the preferences of their own electorate, this article develops and tests a new theoretical model of how local governments site energy developments. The key outcome of the model is a prediction about where voters will approve of new wind turbine construction. The model predictions are evaluated on a new and granular dataset on the siting of all wind turbines in Denmark from 2007 to 2021. The analysis provides strong support for the theoretical model. Building on these findings, we argue that political decentralization may hurt both efficiency and the perceived democratic legitimacy of the transition to a zero carbon economy, as local officials have no incentive to optimize energy efficiency and disregard potential nuisances for those in adjoining municipalities.","Keywords: climate politics, federalism, democratic representation","Asya Magazinnik","Carsten Andersen","Aarhus University","Michael Hankinson","George Washington University","Martin Vinaes Larsen","Aarhus University","Asya Magazinnik","Hertie School","Peter Mortensen","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","Hertie School","Aarhus University","George Washington University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, measuring tolerance for political violence poses significant challenges, as respondents may provide socially desirable rather than truthful answers. This study pursues two primary objectives: (1) to assess the latent tolerance for political violence among Basque citizens, and (2) to estimate the extent of underreporting of these attitudes in survey responses. To address these goals, we employ a list experiment embedded within a survey of a representative sample of the Basque population (N = 2172). By comparing the results of the list experiment with those from a direct (intrusive) question (included in the same survey), we find that the overall acceptance of political violence for achieving political goals is approximately 10% when estimated with the list experiment—a figure 2.5 times higher than the estimate obtained through the direct question. Furthermore, we identify heterogenous patterns in the acceptance of political violence and susceptibility to social desirability bias, linked to respondents’ background characteristics.","Keywords: Political violence, list experiment, Basque country","Georgios Xezonakis, Xavier Barandiaran Irastorza","Georgios Xezonakis","University of Gothenburg","Agnes Cornell","University of Gothenburg","Victor Lapuente Gine","University of Gothenburg","Xavier Barandiaran Irastorza","University of Deusto","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Gothenburg","University of Deusto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, sometimes extractive colonial institutions did increase property rights, with negative developmental consequences. We focus on the case of colonial Mozambique, where the Portuguese government enforced a policy of extremely coercive cotton cultivation in between 1926 and 1961. Using a spatial regression discontinuity approach, we demonstrate significant negative effects of the cotton concessions on a range of present day development outcomes, including various indicators of health, education, wealth, and access to public services such as electricity and water. Yet we also show that, somewhat counterintuitively, rates of land and home ownership are significantly higher inside the former concession areas. We argue that the negative developmental effects of the cotton concessions result from the adverse impact of private property rights on the ability of customary authority to facilitate development. We explore the validity of this mechanism through further analysis of the effect of the concessions on attitudes towards customary authority.","Keywords: Development, Colonialism, Property Rights, Customary Authority, Mozambique","Robin Harding","Tugba Bozcaga","King's College London","Robin Harding","University of Oxford","Arinze Nwokolo","Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","King's College London","Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We test hypotheses concerning how these visual and textual cues shape users’ perceptions of politicians’ ideology  and populist traits, both individually and in interaction with one another. Furthermore, we examine whether apolitical cues remain significant when explicit political information is present  (e.g., politicians' stances on taxation and healthcare), and how respondents’ sociopolitical attributes interact with politicians’ profiles characteristics to shape their inferences.

"abstract_1149_0268_0490.html","Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction","Two office-motivated politicians compete in an election by proposing policies. There are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, causing no lasting effect on welfare if the appropriate policy is implemented, or climate change is severe, leading to decreased welfare even if appropriate measures are taken. Voters receive signals about the state of the world but may choose to hold motivated beliefs, interpreting these signals in a non-Bayesian manner to increase anticipatory utility. If voters a priori believe that severe climate change is unlikely, an equilibrium always exists where they ignore any signal suggesting severe consequences, thereby incentivizing politicians to also disregard their information and offer policies only for mild climate change---even when the politicians are certain of the contrary. If severe climate change results in catastrophic welfare losses, this equilibrium is also unique. However, if severe climate change only leads to moderate welfare losses, an efficient equilibrium exists where politicians choose the optimal policies based on the actual state of the world. In this case, voters' beliefs about the implemented policies become self-fulfilling: if voters trust that politicians will choose optimal policies, this indeed happens in equilibrium. Conversely, if voters expect politicians to ignore information and adhere to a popular policy platform, politicians will follow suit and deliver precisely those policy platforms. I discuss the model's implications for political rhetoric and the importance of trust in government. A first look at the data supports the model's predictions.","Keywords: Political Competition, Climate Change, Motivated Reasoning","Philipp Denter","Philipp Denter",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1150_0742_0772.html","From Preferences to Votes: the Dimensionality of Sociocultural Preferences and the Voting Space","Public opinion on sociocultural issues in Europe has grown increasingly multidimensional. Preferences on gender equality and sexuality are often independent of preferences on immigration. Meanwhile, some political parties combine anti-immigration stances with moderate or progressive positions on traditional morality. This article addresses two key questions: First, are nativist voters more likely to support platforms that are also conservative on traditional morality? Second, do voters with moderate views on immigration favor anti-immigration platforms when bundled with progressive positions on traditional morality? Despite this multidimensionality, I argue that the voting space remains largely unidimensional. Two theoretical mechanisms support my argument. First, conflict on “new issues” related to gender and sexuality may be embedded in the existing sociocultural dimension. Second, issue preferences may be non-separable, meaning voters assess policy platforms as bundles rather than additively. Thus, when immigration is more important to voters than traditional morality, immigration preferences may dominate their choices. Using an original pre-registered survey experiment in Germany, along with descriptive data from Germany and the United Kingdom, I find evidence for these claims. This article highlights how the re-politicization of gender, sexuality, and gender identity issues shapes political conflict in Europe.","Keywords: Issue Dimensionality, Sexuality, Gender Equality, Gender Identity, Immigration","Francesco Raffaelli","Francesco Raffaelli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using data from the Ethnographic Atlas, I provide evidence that the heterogeneity of agricultural growing seasons was a crucial barrier to state centralisation.

The use of potential, rather than observed, agro-ecological data, as well as various robustness tests, give credit to an interpretation of the results beyond the mere correlation.

Recognizing the pivotal role of public opinion in foreign policy decisions, this study employs survey experiments in the United States to investigate whether collaboration with an external actor enhances public backing for COIN operations. I argue that working with a partner persuades the public because the costs are shared, the success is more likely, the people see the operation as necessary, and the threat is perceived as more imminent. While existing research often examines the impact of multilateral alliances, particularly within international organizations like the UN or NATO, my focus is on specific types, such as local, regional, and traditional Western allies given the increasing hostility in the American public towards those organizations. I find that collaboration with external actors does not influence Americans' support for COIN operations on average. Nevertheless, further analyses show that Republicans and Democrats have contrasting preferences regarding collaborating with Western allies. By exploring the potential of collaborations beyond formal international bodies, my research contributes to the growing body of research examining how leaders can garner public support for war-related matters.","Keywords: affective polarization, public opinion, use of force, counterinsurgency","Burak Kazim Yilmaz","Burak Kazim Yilmaz",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Emory University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast to previous research, this study uses longitudinal panel data in the United States and the UK to control for individual-level changes over time and reduce selection effects. The findings reveal minimal evidence of preference falsification or self-censorship. Respondents largely express consistent views, even when observed by others. Where effects emerge, they are inconsistent with theories of systematic self-censorship or preference falsification. This challenges assumptions about the prevalence of self-censorship and preference falsification, suggesting that there is limited self-censorship within families.

The literature has focused especially on public opinion, as well as on the legislative and executive branches, when analyzing its causes and consequences. However, less attention has been paid to whether courts are also affected, particularly in the European context. This paper reflects on judicial polarization—extending the concept of ideological polarization to courts—and contributes to the literature by providing five indicators for analysis: dissent rate, judges' ideology, the ideology of the median judge, whether ideological distance with applicants explains rulings, and whether ideological distance between judges explains agreement. Then, these indicators are correlated with Dalton's (2008) index of polarization to explore the relationship between polarization in court and parliament. The analysis examines decisions by judges of the Spanish Constitutional Court from 1980 to 2023. It begins by inferring judges' ideology through indifference-point estimation.

"abstract_1155_0960_0671.html","From Economic Voting to Environmental Backlash: The Mayan Train and Electoral Dynamics in Mexico","The Mayan Train, one of Mexico's most ambitious infrastructure projects, has sparked intense debate over its socio-environmental impacts. It offers a unique lens to study the intersection of economic development and environmental politics. While such projects promise economic benefits, they can also impose significant environmental costs, influencing political preferences in complex ways.This study examines how the Mayan Train’s economic and environmental effects shaped voting behavior along its route. Using spatial and intensity-based difference-in-differences approaches, I analyze electoral outcomes in areas affected by the train. In regions with pre-existing rights of way, where minimal deforestation accompanied economic benefits and infrastructure improvements, voters rewarded the incumbent party, consistent with economic voting theory. Conversely, in areas marked by extensive deforestation and environmental degradation, voters punished the incumbent and significantly increased their support for the Green Party.These findings reveal the dual influence of economic development and environmental harm on voter behavior, showing how infrastructure projects can simultaneously generate economic gratitude and environmental backlash. This study provides robust evidence of how environmentally harmful projects reshape electoral dynamics, offering critical insights for scholars, policymakers, and advocates navigating the tensions between development, sustainability, and democratic accountability.","Keywords: Mayan Train, retrospective voting, environmental politics, economic development, deforestation.","Paloma Abril Poncela","Paloma Abril Poncela",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper studies changing party brands in Europe by using party names as an indicator of programmatic and organizational transformations. Empirically, we combine an original content analysis of party names in 28 countries from 1945 to 2023 with two conjoint survey experiments. We examine (1) the extent to which European party systems have moved away from classical party brands; (2) the conditions, and the types of parties that are most likely to do so; (3) we identify voters' reactions to non-classical brands. The term party is no longer in vogue among European parties, as they are increasingly dropping it and adopting non-ideological and movement references in their names.  However, adopting a non-classical brand does not yield the expected rewards: it does not affect the appeal of new parties, while rebranding tends to be punished.","Keywords: political parties, party brands, political crisis, conjoint experiments, Europe","Endre Borbáth","Endre Borbáth","Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg; WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Swen Hutter","WZB Berlin Social Science Center; Freie Universität Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Freie Universität Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explores the potential of replacing human interviewers with large language models (LLMs) to conduct scalable conversational interviews. Our goal is to assess the performance of AI Conversational Interviewing and to identify opportunities for improvement in a controlled environment. We conducted a small-scale, in-depth study with university students who were randomly assigned to be interviewed by either AI or human interviewers, both employing identical questionnaires on political topics. Various quantitative and qualitative measures assessed interviewer adherence to guidelines, response quality, participant engagement, and overall interview efficacy. The findings indicate the viability of AI Conversational Interviewing in producing quality data comparable to traditional methods, with the added benefit of scalability.

"abstract_1158_0728_0908.html","The Effects of External Procurement of Military Capabilities on Armed Conflict Risk between States: System Multipolarity & International Stability","This study investigates the relationship between external procurement of military capabilities and the outbreak of armed conflict between states. Researchers’ efforts in uncovering how and when governmental acquisition of military capabilities may precipitate violent confrontation, or rather inhibit fighting between states, have culminated in an array of research designs, theoretical arguments and mixed empirical evidence; thus contributing to contrary policy prescriptions. Scholarly work on the arms-war puzzle often misses that most governments depend on external parties for the acquisition of military capabilities. We argue that different armament transfer configurations lead arming states to evaluate war-related costs and outcomes differently. Cases where state dyads share a supplier of arms may induce a pacifying effect, as sharing partners can alleviate tensions that arise due to the uncertainty behind building capabilities, provide for peaceful conflict adjudication, and ultimately foster cooperation between states. But when state-dyads rely on distinct suppliers of arms, escalatory effects may be triggered if threat perceptions between suppliers and recipients of military capabilities reign. This argument is tested empirically, making use of data on Interwar armament transfers and statistical techniques that adequately control for network effects. The analysis shows that arming in itself is not a significant driver of conflict. Rather, the structures arising from cooperative or competitive behavior among recipients and suppliers of military capabilities condition the pacifying or escalatory effects of build-ups, respectively. In this way, this study proposes a novel argument and research design that extends the theoretical and empirical scope of previous scientific work.","Keywords: Outbreak of Interstate Armed Conflict; Procurement of Weapons; Foreign Policy Cooperation & Competition; Multipolarity; Network Modeling.","Maria Camila Atehortua Cardona","Maria Camila Atehortua Cardona","Geschwister-Scholl Institute of Political Science LMU Munich.","Paul Thurner","Geschwister-Scholl Institute of Political Science LMU Munich.","Marius Mehrl","School of Politics and International Studies of the University of Leeds.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geschwister-Scholl Institute of Political Science LMU Munich.","School of Politics and International Studies of the University of Leeds.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our knowledge about the extent to which individuals are affectively polarized and dislike supporters of other parties is entirely based on surveys that prime respondents to think about politics and their own partisan identity and political preferences. Our study presents a design to investigate the impact of such surveys on estimated levels of affective polarization and to determine if polarization is sensitive to the context within which individuals are asked to rate parties. Using samples from the United States and Germany, we experimentally assess whether measuring affective polarization in a political versus a non-political survey produces systematically different estimates of affective polarization.

"abstract_1160_0421_1037.html","Who Supports Female Candidates? Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment of Gender Affinity in the 2024 UK Election","Do women vote more often for women? Is gender affinity a cross-party phenomenon? The gender affinity effect posits that women are more likely than men to support female candidates and rate them more favorably, particularly female leaders (Dolan, 2008; Sanbonmatsu, 2003). Whether driven by descriptive or substantive representation, evidence for this phenomenon remains mixed. Some studies indicate that female voters favor female candidates, especially in specific electoral contexts, while others find no consistent patterns. These inconsistencies suggest that gender affinity effects are not universal but rather shaped by candidate characteristics, party dynamics, and the broader electoral context. We hypothesize that any affinity effect should consider the diverse range of experiences of women. For example, female voters with children and candidates who are mothers show an affinity that we do not expect to see in men.This study analyses gender affinity in voter behaviour using data from an online survey conducted after the July 2024 UK general election. The survey, with a representative sample of 2,500 respondents, included a conjoint experiment in which participants selected and rated randomly generated candidate profiles. Our results show that any gender affinity effect is for women candidates with certain characteristics. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between being a woman and favouring female candidates and, also, with female candidates with children.Thus, although influenced by contextual factors, gender affinity continues to play an important role in shaping voter preferences and perceptions and highlights important changes in attitudes towards female candidates in current elections.","Keywords: Gender Affinity, Motherhood, Candidates, Elections, United Kingdom","Alejandro Tirado Castro","Alejandro Tirado Castro","Institute of Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)","Susan Banducci","University of Birmingham","Daphne Van der Pas","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)","University of Birmingham","University of Amsterdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While some deepfakes are humorous, others carry malicious intent, harming the reputations of high-profile individuals, including politicians. An exceptionally damaging form involves pornographic content. It disproportionately targets women and has already impacted figures such as US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Drawing on an observational study and an online experiment, our study demonstrates how these sexually explicit deepfakes affect the public's perception of politicians' credibility and competence. Deepfakes blur the boundary between reality and fiction, making them hard to dismiss even after being exposed as false. This poses a particular risk, as people struggle to update their beliefs once initial (mis)perceptions set in. Hence, seeking to offer a remedy to this vicious phenomenon, we also explore whether preemptive debunking can mitigate its adverse effects. Our findings underscore the serious threat deepfakes pose, especially to women, and aim to develop protective strategies to uphold public trust in the democratic process.","Keywords: deepfakes, artificial intelligence, experiments, competence, explicit content","K.

"abstract_1162_0318_1498.html","Political underpinnings of economic success in the Eurozone: The role of wage bargaining coordination","A very influential strand in comparative political economy has traced the Eurozone’s problems to the political-institutional factor of differing domestic wage bargaining institutions. The argument is that stronger wage bargaining coordination is more compatible with the single currency’s macroeconomic regime. The implication is that wage bargaining coordination will explain differing economic success within the Eurozone. This article empirically tests the observable implications of this theory by looking at the relationship between wage bargaining coordination and economic growth. A multitude of specifications analyzing the Eurozone sample (including the newer members) and the broader European Economic Area group, encompassing simple descriptive statistics, panel data analysis, and panel Difference-in-Differences models, fails to support the linear hypothesis. Instead, there is evidence for a curvilinear (hump-shaped) relationship whereby the medium level of coordination is linked to worst macroeconomic outcomes. Furthermore, the article shows how expanding the sample to include the newer members of the Eurozone can affect the discussion on the political-institutional prerequisites of successful performance under a single currency area.","Keywords: wage bargaining, wage coordination, euro, economic growth, EMU, new member states, panel DiD","Vytautas Kuokštis","Vytautas Kuokštis","Vilnius University"," Simonas Algirdas Spurga","Vilnius University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vilnius University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1163_1338_1208.html","When Strategy Meets Personality: Why Political Elites Engage in Attack Behavior (STRATCOM)","Political elites increasingly resort to attacking, insulting and mocking one another, contributing to a growing democratic deficit in contemporary democracies. The literature has primarily argued that such behavior results from strategic rational choice considerations, with opposition elites using attacks to discredit the government’s record. However, recent studies suggest that individual characteristics, such as personality traits, may also explain why political elites resort to attacks. As such, it remains unclear whether elites’ attacking behavior stems from their own rational calculus or their individual characteristics. In this study, we introduce a novel theoretical perspective, proposing that attack behavior results from strategic decisions moderated by individual characteristics, such as personality traits. To test this claim, we surveyed 145 elite politicians in Belgium and analyzed their attacks on other politicians via their personal Facebook pages. Our preliminary findings indicate that engaging in attack behavior is indeed influenced by strategic calculus; for instance, opposition politicians are more likely to attack than those in government. However, these effects are moderated by individual traits. For example, confident politicians in opposition are significantly more likely to engage in attacks compared to less confident opposing politicians. In conclusion, our research offers a new theoretical approach to understanding how strategic and individual factors shape elites’ attack behavior.","Keywords: attack behaviour, personality, politicians, social media,","Željko Poljak","Željko Poljak","University of Antwerp"," Bart Maes","University of Antwerp","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Antwerp",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1164_0922_1259.html","(MIGNEW) Examining the Paradox of Migrant Remittances: Individual Benefits vs. Community Risks in Election-Related Violence","This paper revisits the prevailing narrative of migrant remittances as unequivocal drivers of democratization, shedding light on their paradoxical effects on electoral violence in fragile democracies. While much of the recent literature emphasizes the democratizing influence of remittances—enhancing economic independence, mitigating clientelism, and strengthening civil society—this study contributes to an emerging conversation by highlighting the dual effects of remittances: they can neither be regarded as uniformly democratizing nor solely as undermining political contestation.Using a multilevel analytical framework and drawing on data from the Electoral Contention and Violence (ECAV) dataset and Afrobarometer, this paper disentangles these contrasting dynamics. At the individual level, remittances act as a buffer against political coercion, aligning with democratization theories that connect economic empowerment to reduced susceptibility to manipulation. Conversely, at the community level, remittances can indirectly intensify electoral violence by resourcing opposition movements and amplifying grievances against incumbents, thereby fueling collective unrest.By comparing these effects at both the individual and community levels, this study opens new opportunities for understanding the differentiated impact of remittances. Contextualizing these results within the broader discourse on fragile democracies, and specifically exploring political violence aimed at weakening democratic processes such as elections, this study argues that while remittances empower individuals, they can also destabilize political systems.Although modest in absolute terms, financial remittances can become significant relative to other resources. Once surpassing the threshold required to meet basic needs, they can inadvertently provide rebel groups with crucial funds to sustain operations, procure arms, recruit fighters, and prolong conflicts.","Keywords: Remittances, electoral violence, clientelism, democratization, multilevel analysis.","Abdelkarim Laglil Herradi","Abdelkarim Laglil Herradi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Carlos III University of Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By leveraging this stronger causal identification strategy, we compare the effects of different TLE tactics on key electoral integrity measures, including electoral quality perception, Electoral Management Body autonomy, election-day irregularities, vote buying, intimidation, and voter registry accuracy. Our findings will confirm the disproportionate impact of specific TLE methods and verify whether constitutional court rulings are the most detrimental to electoral integrity. This study not only strengthens causal claims about TLE’s consequences on electoral integrity but also provides critical insights into the institutional pathways through which term-limit evasion erodes democratic norms.","Keywords: term limit evasion, electoral integrity","Hilal Sert","Hilal Sert","Georgia State University; The Carter Center","Ian Batista","The Carter Center","Anthony DeMattee","The Carter Center","David Carroll","The Carter Center","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia State University","The Carter Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Effects of Politics as a Stress Factor for Mental Health in Britain and the United States","Most of the literature on mental health and political behaviour focuses on how people with mental health problems engage in politics. In this paper we want to understand how politics can act as a stress factor for mental health. The aim of our paper is to understand to what extent politics-based stress influences mental health, how big is the effect, who is more affected, what are the potential cognitive mechanisms, and how we can alleviate the effect of stressful politics on mental health. To answer our questions we rely on three original survey datasets from adults (Britain) and young people (Britain and the United States). We find that perceiving politics as more stressful decreases positive mental health and increases negative mental health. We find that the association between stressful politics and mental health is not the same for everyone: it is stronger for those who have experience with mental health problems, have dysfunctional attitudes, use maladaptive coping and emotion regulation strategies and have low cognitive control. Many of these factors mediate the relationship. Lastly, we suggest that the use of adaptive strategies may be beneficial for reducing the effect of stressful politics on mental health.","Keywords: stressful politics, mental health, young people","Luca Bernardi","Luca Bernardi","University of Liverpool","Jonathan Roiser","University College London","Emma Bridger","University of Leicester","James Gross","Stanford University","Rowan Board","University College London","","","","","","","","","","","University of Liverpool","University College London","University of Leicester","Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that partisan incentives, shaped by geography and connectivity, condition these responses. In dense city centers, limited space and stable demographics constrain how much partisanship matters. In well-connected suburban belts, conservative mayors may limit multi-family construction to avoid an influx of left-leaning urbanites, whereas left-wing leaders embrace such developments to broaden their electoral base. In peripheral municipalities less connected to the city, fears of a changing electorate are weaker, reducing partisan polarization over housing supply. Using a novel, nationwide panel of German municipalities (1990–2021) and a close-elections regression discontinuity design, I identify the causal impact of partisan control on housing supply conditional on geography and connectivity. Linking these outcomes to individual-level panel data reveals how mover demographics reinforce or undermine partisan equilibria. The findings highlight that partisan considerations, not just zoning or NIMBYism, shape housing supply and contribute to persistent affordability challenges.","Keywords: housing, local politics, partisanship, geography","Vincent Heddesheimer","Vincent Heddesheimer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1169_1956_0166.html","Affluent Legislators Representing Ordinary Citizens: Evidence from South Africa","Wealthy individuals ascending to national leadership roles around the world have captured widespread attention. This trend often raises questions about the extent to which these affluent politicians are willing or able to represent the interests of ordinary citizens. While much of the existing research on democratic representation has explored how politicians' background characteristics, such as education and prior occupation, shape their behavior, there is relatively little focus on the consequences of the wealth of politicians. Additionally, most studies have concentrated on political behavior in rich democracies, leaving a gap in understanding how these dynamics play out in other contexts. This paper examines the political behavior of wealthy politicians, focusing on South Africa as a case study. South Africa provides a unique setting due to its extreme inequality, with many previously disadvantaged individuals entering politics after apartheid, some of whom have accumulated significant personal wealth. Indeed, legislators across African democracies are disproportionally more educated and coming from professional and corporate backgrounds than citizens, compared to democracies in Europe and the Americas. Using newly collected data on the assets of Members of Parliament (MPs), parliamentary questions and speeches, this study investigates whether wealthier MPs engage in different parliamentary behavior, particularly on policy issues that could have self-interested consequences, such as taxation. Our findings contribute to the broader literature by offering new insights into how wealth influences political behavior and representation, particularly in the Global South.","Keywords: Policy positions; Descriptive representation; Legislative behavior; Economic background of politicians","Leticia Barbabela","Leticia Barbabela","Philipps-Universität Marburg","Giulia Venturini","University of Strathclyde","Despina Alexiadou","University of Strathclyde","Miquel Pellicer","Philipps-Universität Marburg","Eva Wegner","Philipps-Universität Marburg","","","","","","","","","","","Philipps-Universität Marburg","University of Strathclyde",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While electoral campaigns frequently employ group-targeted appeals, their success varies significantly. In particular, disadvantaged groups often fail to support political parties advocating beneficial policies targeted at them. Potential explanations could be cognitive (e.g., difficulty identifying the target population of the policy or self-categorizing in this population), psychological (e.g., varying levels of group identification), and social (e.g., the stigmatization or social construction of groups). This study examines how social status, group identity, and the framing of campaign appeals shape voters’ responses to group-targeted promises. We draw on a vignette experiment conducted in the US and Germany, where participants are presented with hypothetical campaign appeals featuring promises targeted at groups of varying social status. Our contribution is twofold: first, we introduce and test the argument that voters from low-status groups are less likely to respond to beneficial electoral promises ; second, we provide insight into the cognitive, psychological, and social mechanisms underlying these responses.

Special interests know the state of the world and have state-independent policy preferences. Voters use signals sent by special interests to form opinions about the appropriate policy. The altered public opinion creates electoral pressure, to which incumbents respond by making policy concessions from their ideal policies. The known bias of special interests constrains their ability to persuade voters, but the possibility that sufficiently misaligned incumbents may be electorally aided by moderate public opinion incentivizes special interests to exaggerate the state of the world in the direction of their bias. The strategic exaggeration and the resulting policy distortion increase with the extremism of the special interest.

Among the European Union’s (EU) most influential bilateral relationships rank its dealings with China. In the face of an assertive Chinese regime, the EU has repeatedly struggled to speak with a single voice, watering down, delaying or disagreeing over policy proposals. The recent disputes over the introduction of EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles provide a particularly visible example for this dynamic. In this paper, we seek to systematically investigate the “China effect” on the trajectory of European integration. To do so, we assess the effects of China import shocks on public support for enhanced European political and economic integration. Adapting and updating the measure proposed by Colantone and Stanig (2018) for the period from 2008 to 2022, we look into the regional NUTS2-level effects of increased import competition on citizens’ demands for EU competencies. While the general observation of a rise in economic nationalism holds, we short that, given certain scope conditions, increased import competition from China can also cause enhanced support for EU cooperation and integration.","Keywords: China; European integration; external shocks; member states; public opinion","Lucas Schramm","Christian Freudlsperger","ETH Zurich","Pit Rieger","ETH Zurich","Lucas Schramm","LMU Munich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETH Zurich","LMU Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose that in low-trust contexts, such as Spain, crises may prompt a shift in preferences for crisis management from political authorities to non-political actors. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a field experiment across municipalities experiencing different levels of disaster impact: high-intensity areas (Treatment 1), medium-intensity areas (Treatment 2), and low-intensity areas (Control). We anticipate that in low-intensity contexts, individuals will favor centralized political management of crises and exhibit broader support for centralization within Spain’s territorial framework. Conversely, high-intensity crises are expected to foster preferences for non-political actors, driven by declining institutional trust and heightened anti-political attitudes. Our study employs a combination of survey instruments and conjoint experiments to measure preferences for crisis management and territorial organization, while also investigating the underlying roles of trust and attitudinal shifts. By examining how crises and institutional trust shape governance preferences, this research provides valuable insights into public responses to governance during periods of crisis.","Keywords: Crisis, polarization, trust, Spain, DANA, centralization","Sandra León","Sandra León","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","Amuitz Garmendia","Carlos III-Juan March Institute, Carlos III University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Autónoma de Madrid","Carlos III-Juan March Institute, Carlos III University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous work has argued that this is the result of partisans selectively tolerating violations. We argue that voters are often not familiar with key democratic norms, and therefore unable to accurately identify norm violations. In absence of this knowlege, they rely on partisan cues. We run a survey experiment using a two-wave panel survey in Germany to put this theory to the test. In the first wave, we inform voters about democratic norms and backsliding using a video and a quiz. In the second wave, we assess their sensitivity to democratic norm violations using a conjoint experiment, evaluations of two real-world norm violations, and a hypothetical scenario. Our results will reveal whether making citizens aware of key democratic norms and their potential violation enables them to accurately recognize violations, assign blame, and adjust their voting intentions to defend democracies.

Provisional appointments, which place early-career judges in temporary roles, can undermine judicial independence and expose them to external pressures. These dynamics are further intensified in hierarchical judicial systems where career progression—appointments, promotions, and discipline—is controlled by higher courts.The research investigates patterns of strategic behavior by analyzing the alignment between lower court decisions and the preferences of higher courts in non-routine cases where ideological considerations are significant. Focusing on Chilean cases from 2015 to 2024, the study explores how provisional tenure shapes judicial behavior through a strategic rational-choice model. The analysis also accounts for judicial characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and experience), case factors (e.g., topic, jurisdiction, and review scope), and political influences, offering a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics that influence judicial decision-making.This study contributes to the understanding of how institutional arrangements, particularly tenure status, influence judges. By identifying patterns in judicial decision-making, it offers critical insights into the implications of provisional tenure for judicial independence and accountability, as well as the broader governance of justice systems.

More specifically, it examines how localized natural disasters influence climate change awareness by focusing on the extremely high rainfall events of October 2024 in Eastern Spain. These torrential rains, which primarily affected towns south of the capital city of Valencia, caused widespread destruction of businesses, homes, and public property and resulted in over 200 fatalities. The disaster not only underscored the vulnerability of certain regions to climate change but also led to national debates on public policies design and State´s effectiveness to respond to those natural disasters. Using a Difference-in-Differences design, this research investigates shifts in climate change awareness in Valencia compared to the rest of Spain before and after this natural disaster. By integrating data from several public opinion surveys, the study aims to uncover whether populations directly affected by severe climate events exhibit a heightened awareness of climate issues relative to unaffected regions. The findings provide valuable insights into how localized climate impacts shape public opinion and highlight disparities in climate change perceptions across different individuals, helping policy makers, activists and other organizations to better understand these changes in public opinion following a climate catastrophe and allowing them, as a result, to act more precisely on communicational strategies to mitigate climate change impact.","Keywords: Climate change, natural disaster, public opinion, green policies, Difference in Differences","Luis Azores","Luis Azores",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1178_1895_0837.html","The Name of the Game: Party Branding in Post-Authoritarian Regimes","An increasing number of studies highlight the ideological backlash created by past dictatorships, but little is known about its effects on party competition in new democracies. How do political entrepreneurs, who might otherwise align with the former regime's ideology, respond to the stigma attached to that side? Building on signaling theory, we argue that one response parties can adopt is to strategically name themselves in such a way so as to signal their ideological distance from the past dictatorship. Through a well-powered pre-registered survey, we ask 1,000 independent coders to guess the ideological side of approx. 1,500 European parties and their position on the Left-Right (L-R) scale only via the party name (in English). We then assess relative success in predictions, depending on the degree of alignment of parties to the stigmatized ideological side, benchmarking coders’ evaluations to the assessments of experts from CMP and CHES. Our analyses show that parties that are more Right-Wing (Left-Wing) will be perceived by coders as being less so in former Right-Wing (Left-Wing) regimes, compared to those in so-called mature democracies. This effect appears to be driven by parties on the Dictator’s Side (DS): the distance between the L-R scores assigned by coders and experts is, in fact, more positive (more negative) in former Left-Wing (Right-Wing) dictatorships than in established democracies for parties located on the DS, compared to parties from the non-DS.","Keywords: ideology; authoritarianism; new democracies; party strategy; signaling","Elias Dinas","Elias Dinas","European University Institute","Riccardo di Leo","European University Institute","Lucia Domenech","European University Institute","Ksenia Northmore-Ball","Queen Mary, London","","","","","","","","","","","","","European University Institute","Queen Mary, London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies suggest that this enduring loyalty is driven by social pressure within their communities and the influence of African American elites. Similarly, recent research indicates that social networks play a role in shaping the political behavior of racial minorities in Canada, much like they do for African Americans in the United States. Just as African Americans with the Democratic Party, racial minorities in Canada overwhelmingly support the socially left-leaning Liberal Party of Canada despite being more socially conservative than the White majority. Focusing on Black Canadians, this research explores whether progressive ideological cues influence the likelihood of Black Canadians voting for the Liberal Party and whether the racial composition of their social network mediates this effect using a survey experiment. Results show that social pressure affects the probability of voting for the Liberal Party, like in the United States. However, unlike African Americans with the Democratic Party in the United States, ideology affects Black voters' probability of voting for the Liberal Party in Canada.","Keywords: Black voters, Canada, public opinion, survey experiment","Nadjim Fréchet","Nadjim Fréchet",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Université de Montréal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1180_1360_0909.html","Geoeconomic Power and Vulnerability: A Typology of Chokepoints and When They Arise","After decades of globalization and market liberalization, national security concerns increasingly drive market interventions through tools like subsidies, tariffs, and sanctions. These policies center around ‘chokepoints’ within international economic networks, which are sources of power for states controlling them and vulnerabilities for those who depend on them. When do international economic exchanges become chokepoints? Existing theories focus on the structure of the international economic system as well as the characteristics of states, industries, and firms. But this leaves much variation unexplained. For example, one product offered by a particular firm may be a potent chokepoint, while other goods or services by the same producer can be substituted easily. Integrating weaponized interdependence research with microeconomic concepts of market power addresses this gap by identifying the product-level conditions for four types of chokepoints to arise: international network effects, technological advantages, localized raw materials, and monopsonies. Case studies illustrate this analytical framework, advancing our understanding of when states have the capacity to inflict high costs on foreign actors by restricting particular economic exchanges. This framework has important implications for industrial policies aimed at advancing national security and geoeconomic power.","Keywords: Weaponized interdependence, market power, substitution costs, chokepoints, international economic coercion, industrial policy","Claas Mertens","Claas Mertens",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This approach allows us to systematically study nonresponse biases across various sociodemographic profiles, providing detailed insights into the factors influencing participation rates.To improve response rates and mitigate nonresponse biases, we have conducted a series of recruitment experiments focusing on incentives and reminders. These experiments evaluate the effectiveness of diverse strategies, such as varying the type and amount of incentives offered and the frequency of reminders. Leveraging the data collected from these experiments, we have developed predictive models to estimate nonresponse probabilities based on participants’ characteristics and their previous responses in refreshment samples.With access to an extensive dataset of nearly 90,000 cases, we utilize machine learning models to better understand and predict nonresponse behavior. Our focus extends beyond improving response rates; instead, we prioritize enhancing the representativity of the panel to achieve a more balanced and accurate sample. We also evaluate data quality to ensure that methodological innovations lead to more reliable results. Crucially, the Catalan Citizen Panel provides a unique opportunity to empirically test the effectiveness of Adaptive Survey Design (ASD), demonstrating how tailored protocols can optimize treatment allocation and improve samples for public opinion research.","Keywords: Adaptive Survey Design, Panel Data, Nonresponse Bias, Public Opinion Research, Survey Methodology","Joel Ardiaca","Joel Ardiaca","Universitat de Barcelona","Jordi Muñoz","Universitat de Barcelona","Raül Tormos","Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat de Barcelona","Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conduct an experiment to evaluate whether ``edits"" of prominent politicians can change voter perceptions.

"abstract_1184_1005_1496.html","Job precarity and attitudes towards labor unions: The mitigating role of immigrant background","How does the internationalization of the workforce and increasing presence of non-standard employment relate to trade union attitudes in advanced democracies? While evidence from Europe shows that immigrant workers are significantly less likely to unionize than natives, little attention has been paid to immigrants’ attitudes towards unions despite their potential role in explaining immigrant-native unionization gaps. In this paper, we contribute to this understudied research by shifting the focus to the increasing job precarity in non-standard employment– highly concentrated among immigrant workers – and its implication on immigrants’ union attitudes. We argue that job precarity contributes to the lack of collective action and political demand towards unions among immigrants. Notably, we suggest that the distinct importance of the workplace for social and political integration among immigrants, pre-existing immigrant-specific labor market discriminations, and linkages between employment and residence status explain why job precarity has particularly detrimental effects on union attitudes among immigrants. Using data from 13 Western European countries, we show that immigrants in fixed-term contracts hold significantly more adverse attitudes towards unions than those in standard employment situations. On the contrary, we find that native workers’ attitudes towards unions are uncorrelated with the precarity of their employment status. We conclude that job precarity among immigrant workers might further explain unionization gaps as it leads to more pessimistic union attitudes among immigrant workers.  Considering increasing immigration and non-standard employment, our findings highlight a crucial issue to be addressed for the future sustainability of social dialogue and industrial relations in Europe.","Keywords: Immigration, trade unions, non-standard employment, precariousness","Anna-Lena Nadler, Elif Kayran","Anna-Lena Nadler","University of Fribourg","Elif Kayran","European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Fribourg","European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1185_1448_1206.html","STRATCOM: Strategic or Haphazard? Understanding Party Ambiguity during the 2019 and 2024 Belgian Electoral Campaigns.","Party ambiguity refers to the presentation of unclear issue positions by political parties. Some view it as a strategic tool to hide unpopular positions, broaden appeal, and avoid accountability (Downs, 1957; Somer-Topcu, 2015). Others argue that it is a risky strategy, contingent on voters’ risk aversity (Shepsle, 1972; Bartels, 1986). Both perspectives, however, share the assumption that ambiguity is a deliberate strategy. This paper challenges this assumption by theorizing that ambiguity can also arise unintentionally. Specifically, we hypothesize that low party discipline increases the likelihood of haphazard ambiguity. In addition, we explore the strategic use of ambiguity beyond vote-seeking incentives. While existing literature emphasizes these electoral incentives, we argue that parties may also employ ambiguity to pursue policy-seeking objectives (Strøm, 1990). Unambiguous communication can enable parties to highlight their preferred policy issues, particularly in areas aligned with their issue reputations (Frenkel, 2014). To test these claims, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles from the 2019 and 2024 Belgian electoral campaigns. For each campaign, 35 policy issues were selected to capture the relevant space of party competition. We conceptualize ambiguity as a multidimensional phenomenon, measured across three dimensions: vagueness vs. precision, silence vs. emphasis, and inconsistency vs. consistency (Lefevere, 2024). This multidimensional framework allows us to advance our understanding of both the strategic and unintended nature of party ambiguity across dimensions.","Keywords: Strategic Ambiguity, Party Competition, Ambiguity, Vote-seeking Incentives, Policy-seeking Incentives","Merel Fieremans","Merel Fieremans","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","Silvia Erzeel","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","Jonas Lefevere","Universiteit Antwerpen; Vrije Universiteit Brussel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","Universiteit Antwerpen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the well-known exit-voice-loyalty framework by Albert O. Hirschman, we test for the two safety valves often identified in this literature: the economic and the security safety valve. We use data on assisted emigration through the Instituto Español de Emigración (Spanish Emigration Institute) during the 1960s, historical secondary research, and interviews to returnees to study whether workers were selected from geographic provinces of high unemployment (economic safety valve) and/or high political conflict (security safety valve) or both. While we do find suggestive evidence of the first safety valve shaping the screening of applications, the regime appears to have prevented the recruitment from provinces of high political conflict for fear of a politicized diaspora contaminating temporary labour emigration and challenging the regime from abroad. Concerns about the survival of the regime appear to have played a role, at least in crafting the emigration outflow that the regime could control.","Keywords: Emigration, dictators Spain","Covadonga Meseguer","Covadonga Meseguer","ICADE","Laura Maravall","Universidad de Alcalá de Henares","Angel Muñiz","Universidad Europea Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICADE","Universidad de Alcalá de Henares","Universidad Europea Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1187_1686_1324.html","District magnitude and minority representation under personalised electoral systems","How does the size of district magnitudes influence minority representation? Whilst this has been a classic topic in the institutionalist literature on representation, most causally robust evidence to date concerns close-list PR systems and the interactive effect of gender quotas (Lucardi and Micozzi 2010 AJPS), with the assumption that parties are the enforcer of these quotas. The literature has yet to causally examine the effect of district magnitudes on minority representation under less party-centred systems, such as open-list PR and SNTV systems, which are still prevalent throughout many democracies both at the national and subnational levels. This paper seeks to causally identify the effect of district magnitude size by employing a difference-in-differences design on an original dataset from Japanese local elections, which use SNTV with varying district magnitudes and where women are notoriously underrepresented. Since different levels (prefectural and municipal) of local elections are held simultaneously within identical district boundaries but often with different magnitudes, and exhibit only parochial differences in terms of candidate selection processes, the level of party-centredness and policy issues, Japanese local elections present a powerful case to find quasi-experimental evidence of any district magnitude size effect. As political experience at the local level is often a crucial step in political careers in many democracies, the findings will likely have implications on minority representation to numerous polities employing less party-centred electoral systems at the national or subnational level.","Keywords: District magnitude, minority representation, personalised electoral systems, local elections, difference-in-differences","Kento Ohara","Kento Ohara",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1188_1209_1425.html","Shouldering Childhood: Early Behavioral Traits and Discrimination Concerns","This study examines how childhood emotions, traits, and behaviors influence concerns about gender inequality and racism in young adulthood. Drawing on insights from social psychology and political science, we examine whether behavioral traits measured in childhood - before political attitudes crystallize - are associated with discrimination concerns later in life. Specifically, we use data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal dataset and focus on three behavioral dimensions assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: internalizing problems (e.g., loneliness and frequent worry), externalizing problems (e.g., impulsivity and temperamental behavior), and prosocial traits (e.g., consideration for others’ feelings).Our results show that internalizing behaviors in childhood are positively associated with later concerns about discrimination, whereas externalizing behaviors show a negative correlation. Finally, individuals with stronger prosocial traits are more concerned about racism. These patterns are particularly pronounced among native males, highlighting how social stratification influences these relationships. Importantly, we account for key confounding factors, including cognitive abilities and school-level variation, and demonstrate that these results are robust even when holding political interests constant through Average Controlled Direct Effect estimates.By relying on teachers' assessments of children's behavior rather than parents' reports, we mitigate potential biases due to parental characteristics or political attitudes. Our findings suggest that childhood experiences shape political attitudes before political preferences crystallize and underscore the importance of understanding the developmental origins of discrimination concerns.","Keywords: Discrimination Concerns, Behavioural Traits, Childhood, Political Preferences","Maria Rubio-Cabañez","Maria Rubio-Cabañez","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Josep Serrano-Serrat","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A template for measuring regime developments in very democratic countries.","Few social science concepts have been scrutinized as carefully as ‘democracy’, and measurement efforts abound. Yet, existing democracy measures typically pertain to the national level, despite the importance of, and ample variation in, democracy at the regional and local levels. Moreover, most measures do not differentiate well between countries towards the more democratic end of the scale.  In this paper, we introduce and discuss measures intentionally developed to capture variation in democracy levels – at the national, regional, and local levels -- even among “very democratic” regimes. We discuss difficulties with and guidelines for how to build comprehensive democracy concepts that incorporate relevant features and practices that may vary in such contexts. Next, we discuss how such concepts can be measured in practice and how to mitigate the different challenges with doing so, including data collection for hard-to-measure indicators, properly scaling indicators without clear maximum values, and aggregating varied indicators in a manner that reflects the conceptual logic. To illustrate these points, we draw on recent efforts to measure five democracy dimensions for Norway across 2015-2021. These efforts stem from a larger assessment of Norwegian democracy, aiming to identify its relative strengths as well as areas with ample room for improvement, and recent positive and negative trends. We thereafter discuss remaining validity and reliability issues with the 15 indices – five each at the national, regional, and local levels – before assessing the potential for (and pitfalls related to) extending and adapting these indices to measure democracy in other contexts.","Keywords: democracy, democratic quality, conceptualization, measurement, Norway","Carl Henrik Knutsen","Carl Henrik Knutsen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we seek to understand the effect interpersonal communications within social networks have on moderating dangerous beliefs in the network, in particular, moderating support for political violence. To examine this question, we field a complex and unique survey experiment involving hundreds of real network dyads who disagree on their support for political violence, randomizing whether the dyad has a conversation with each other about political violence or not, and then observing potential changes in support for political violence among the dyad members. We find that these conversations can be persuasive, however, they are most persuasive for moderates - making those who previously eschewed political violence potentially more sympathetic towards it use, while having limits effects among violence supports. These results highlight the potential risks of of trying to leverage real world social networks to persuade people away from extremist beliefs.","Keywords: political violence, public opinion, interpersonal communication, experiment","Carly Wayne","Carly Wayne","Washington University in St. Louis","Taylor Carlson","Washington University in St. Louis","Erin Rossiter","University of Notre Dame","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington University in St. Louis","University of Notre Dame",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Role of Distortions and Ethno-partisanship in Normative Evaluations of Clientelism","Where political parties form around coalitions of ethnic groups, as in many sub-Saharan African democracies, political actors' favoritism toward their own supporters plays a prominent and normatively fraught role in electoral competition and public service delivery. However, little is known about how citizens normatively evaluate whether such ``clientelistic behaviors'' should be considered illegal and punishable. This study hypothesizes that citizens will desire greater punishment for clientelistic actions when (a) the behavior is more distortionary (e.g., targeting coethnics vs. copartisans vs. general people), and (b) the citizen holds opposing ethnopartisanship to the actor. We also posit a positive interaction between the two. Using a survey experiment conducted in Kenya (n=1,946) with Kikuyu and Luo respondents ahead of the 2017 national elections, we ask participants to assign punishment for various clientelistic behaviors. The results show that citizens systematically award more punishment when actors target their supporters rather than general people, with little difference between coethnic versus copartisan targeting. Citizens also punish actors more from the opposing ethnopartisanship, but there is no systematic interaction effect between the level of distortion and (un)shared ethnopartisanship.","Keywords: Clientelism, Political Economy, Ethnic Politics, Partisan Polarization","Kristin Michelitch","Kristin Michelitch","Social and Behavioral Sciences Department, Toulouse School of Economics; Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, Toulouse School of Economics","Giacomo Lemoli","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, Toulouse School of Economics","Jeremy Horowitz","CEGA, University of Berkeley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social and Behavioral Sciences Department, Toulouse School of Economics","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, Toulouse School of Economics","CEGA, University of Berkeley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Beyond its staggering economic implications, with losses estimated between US$1.5 to US$2 trillion (roughly 2 percent of global GDP). Similarly, high levels of inequality—whether rooted in income, wealth or opportunity—are detrimental and often linked to conflict, political disparity, and diminished quality of life. Despite the prominence and policy relevance of these issues, their interconnection remains unclear. While the literature  has grown in recent years, it has predominantly used aggregates and focused mostly on correlational evidence at the cross-country level. This paper provides the first experimental and causal evidence testing the hypothesis that being informed about a situation of corruption within a country causes people to overestimate the magnitude of socio-economic inequality. I am in the process of conducting three pre-registered face-to-face vignette survey experiments (n=1000 in each country) on a representative national omnibus-type sample in three countries: Lithuania, Hungary, and Moldova. Half of the respondents were exposed to a short vignette that includes three dimensions: global ranking, survey evidence, and policy efforts. This treatment is based on excerpts from annual reports on corruption by Transparency International, as well as on corruption perceptions from the Global Corruption Barometer and EU reports on progress in the fight against corruption. I theorize that exposure to a corruption situation in a particular country, on average, causes a one standard deviation increase in responses to questions related to the inequality of wealth, income, rural-urban divide, and opportunities.","Keywords: corruption, socio-economic inequality, experiment","Denis Ivanov","Denis Ivanov",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vilnius UniversityCorvinus University of Budapest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To answer this question, I develop a stylized game-theoretic model of political agency in which an incumbent politician decides between implementing a safe policy or an infrastructure project. While the former action immediately produces a payoff for the voter, the latter can substantially improve the future welfare of the voter, but it is also open to corruption and thus subject to an investigation. Despite the investigation is more likely to correctly reveal whether the incumbent engaged in corruption, there is always a positive probability of type-I and -II errors. The voter, being uncertain about whether the incumbent is corrupt, uses the policy choice and safe policy's payoff or investigation outcome to screen out bad politicians. When the incumbent has high reputation, she is re-elected absent bad news and thus the fear of being unjustly perceived as corrupt deters her from implementing the project. In contrast, when her reputation is low, a noncorrupt incumbent has an incentive to implement the project and undergo the investigation to signal her type. Being certain of not being re-elected absent good information, an incumbent may gamble on her future by encouraging voter learning in the aim of highlighting her honesty. However, for this to be an equilibrium, corruption cannot be too profitable as otherwise an honest politician may signal her honesty by not doing the project and thus forgoing large private gains.","Keywords: Corruption, Investigation, Signaling","Lorenzo De Rosa","Lorenzo De Rosa",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Student Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, the role political elites see for themselves in representing citizens within the EU remains underexplored. Existing literature has primarily emphasized territorial representation as the dominant mode of representation in EU politics. In this paper, I argue that political elites in the EU seek not only to represent citizens as a unified whole but also to advocate for distinct social groups across and within European societies, reflecting deeper cleavages. Moreover, I propose that elites do not merely respond to public opinion but actively contribute to shaping it by connecting policies to group identities and interests. These findings challenge the conventional understanding of elite responsiveness, suggesting that elite conceptions of representation are more nuanced and multifaceted than previously thought. Drawing on interviews with EU political elites and computational text analysis of EU parliamentary discourse, this study compares elites' stated intentions of representation with their actual discursive practices. The results provide new insights into how political elites address growing Euroscepticism and disengagement, which stem from perceived failures of representation at the EU level.","Keywords: Representation, Euroscepticism, EU Parliament, Political elites","Ronja Sczepanski","Ronja Sczepanski",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Sciences Po Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When coercion is not a feasible option, alternative strategies to build fiscal capacity include the creation of credible commitment institutions and cooptation. We analyze the case of France in the aftermath of the Hundred Years War, in a context where central authority was very weak and kings faced powerful internal rivals. We combine detailed data on the establishment of fiscal jurisdictions with information on the gradual extension of the royal domain, the creation of offices, and representative institutions. We exploit succession rules which induced quasi-random variation in the royal domain, and show that direct territorial control promoted fiscal capacity. We also find that fiscal jurisdictions are associated with the granting of prestigious offices to local elites, suggesting that cooptation was an important complementary instrument. We find no evidence that representative institutions played a major role in the development of fiscal capacity.","Keywords: historical political economy, state-building, state capacity, bureaucracy, France","Anne Degrave","Anne Degrave","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse","Ronan Tallec","Université Paris Cité","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse","Université Paris Cité",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extant scholarship points to three types of reasons at the individual level: a) the effect of information asymmetries, b) partisan and other in-group loyalties, and c) side-payments. We focus on one kind of ‘side-payment’, namely policy congruence on climate change mitigation and the polarization generated around positions on climate change mitigation. We use data from a conjoint experiment that asks respondents to assess three pairs of profiles for politicians and then choose one from each pair rating how much they like and how well each profile represents them. The conjoint is embedded in a survey with 13,000 respondents across 10 EU countries conducted in 2024. We focus on the effects of the profile’s deceitful behaviour (none, lying, abusing powers and taking bribes) and their position on climate change mitigation (keep current measures, accelerate measures and slow down measures). We test the following pre-registered core hypotheses: (1) deceitful behaviors have weaker effects on choice when the respondent and profile agree on measures for climate change mitigation; (2) Respondents who display attitudes consistent with climate change concern and are highly polarized against climate skeptics will not penalize deceitful behavior for choice when the politician proposes accelerating measures. (3) Respondents who display attitudes consistent with climate skepticism and climate change denial and are highly polarized against climate skeptics will not penalize deceitful behavior for choice when the politician proposes slowing down measures.","Keywords: Conjoint experiment, climate change, corruption, issue congruence, polarization.","Laura Morales","Laura Morales","IPP, CSIC","Henrik Serup Christensen","Åbo Akademi University","Luis Ramiro","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED)","Janette Huttunen","Åbo Akademi University","","","","","","","","","","","","","IPP, CSIC","Åbo Akademi University","Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I analyze the 2009 Basque regional elections, where the banning of a political party led to over 100,000 null votes, disproportionately affecting the nationalist bloc. As a result, Basque nationalists lost control of the regional government to Basque non-nationalists for the first time. This unprecedented outcome triggered an identity backlash, altering social behaviors within and across identity groups.To study this phenomenon, I use a novel onomastic dataset of newborns’ names to capture identity-driven household decisions: the Basque Name Index (BNI). Distinctively Basque (Spanish) names are interpreted as an increased effort by parents to signal their identity to the community in opposition to the other group. Moreover, I use vote shares as proxy of communities´ identity preferences.By combining municipal-level electoral data with BNI trends and controlling for parental characteristics, I find that in electorally competitive municipalities, where both identities coexist, backlash emerged captured by a greater dispersion in the BNI. In contrast, strongholds (whether nationalist or non-nationalist) saw reinforcement of the dominant identity.This study highlights how electoral outcomes impacts social behavior by revealing the previously hidden political preferences of the community which affect pre-established norms. Polarization and identity-based responses might result in cases where the election outcome is unexpected.","Keywords: Social norms, Socialization, Elections, Backlash, Identity","Jose Maycas-Sardi","Jose Maycas-Sardi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1198_2531_0670.html","When losers win: the electoral consequences of pro-climate policies in fossil fuel-dependent communities","How does political geography impede efforts to mitigate climate change? Climate policies impose costs on geographically concentrated carbon-intensive industries and their surrounding communities. This is politically costly: evidence demonstrates voters punish pro-climate parties for job losses in fossil fuel-producing regions. Existing studies often focus, however, on ex-post electoral consequences. We know little about how voters in these communities respond ex-ante to proposed climate polices. I study this question in the context of the 2019 Australian federal election. Australia is a top fossil producer, and carbon-intensive activity is highly concentrated in specific regions. The 2019 election was dubbed the 'climate election' because climate split the major parties: the Labor Party proposed a package of reforms, while the Liberal-National Coalition advocated for fossil fuel expansion. I assemble a novel database of vote shares in over 4,000 polling places over seven elections. I use difference-in-differences to estimate whether a community's fossil fuel intensity caused it to punish the pro-climate party in 2019, compared to a matched control group. To unpack whether perceptions of material cost drive election results, I compare communities facing short and long-term policy risks. I expect the pro-climate party to suffer more in communities dominated by coal-fired power generation and threatened by renewable energy expansion, than those surrounding metallurgical coal mining for export. My findings shed light on the electoral consequences of geographically concentrated 'policy losers' in majoritarian systems. I help to reveal the mechanisms driving these dynamics and provide insights for policymakers developing political strategies for climate change mitigation.","Keywords: climate change, fossil fuels, political geography, elections","Claudia Zwar","Claudia Zwar",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1199_2145_1437.html","Need for security in Sweden’s vulnerable neighborhoods","Two of the central goals of the democratic state are to provide its citizens with security and protect their civil liberties. In normal times, when things are proceeding in a predictable manner, people generally defend their freedoms and are suspicious of large-scale surveillance technologies. While there are several studies on how in the aftermath of terrorist attacks people tend to favor stronger security policies, more research is needed on how people who live in high-crime neighborhoods think about these issues. Therefore, in this paper, we examine what residents in such neighborhoods think about using surveillance technologies like cameras and key tags. We use questions with both open-ended and closed-ended response options to better understand their attitudes. We have conducted five surveys in Malmö’s vulnerable neighborhoods (n = 2100). The residents are often described as hard to survey as many have foreign background and lower socio-economic status, but we overcome these obstacles by working closely with local housing agencies, fielding our surveys in multiple languages and conducting face-to-face interviews. We compare these results with data from a representative Swedish sample (n = 1000). In line with our expectation, we find that residents in vulnerable neighborhoods are very much in favor of policies that enhance their security.","Keywords: public opinion, security, crime","Jacob Sohlberg","Jacob Sohlberg","University of Gothenburg"," Peter Esaiasson","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that scholars frequently overlook the economic gains obtained through military power due to a lack of theoretical guidance on how these gains are generated. We develop a theory in which military power generates economic gains via three pathways: 1) by forcing the transfer of goods, services or assets at non-market prices (for free in the case of outright theft); 2) by altering supply; 3) by altering demand. We then apply our theory to reveal that, once we know where to look, we find a multitude of examples of military power generating economic gains in the modern era. Our typology reveals how states can use military force to manipulate markets, move prices, and engage in economic warfare, benefiting themselves and their allies while disadvantaging rivals. Our theory offers important insights into the relationship between military strategy, market dynamics, and economic competition, shedding light on how great powers use force to shift the balance of economic power in their favor.","Keywords: Great powers, military power, economic power","Benjamin Graham","Benjamin Graham","University of Southern California","Jonathan Markowitz","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1201_0100_0981.html","What do Average People Perceive as Extreme Weather?","With global warming intensifying, average citizens are beginning to experience its impact more directly. More than 100 recent studies have examined the link between direct extreme weather experience and shifts in climate policy preferences but have found inconclusive results. One reason for this inconclusiveness is that so far, it is not well understood what average citizens perceive as extreme weather. This project develops a novel framework to analyze how average people perceive extreme weather based on open-ended survey responses. We leverage various automated text-as-data methods to analyze open-ended responses across four languages in a geocoded Swiss panel study based on a probability sample. Based on structural topic models, transformer-based classifiers and a novel zero-shot classification method, we capture in depth when and how people perceive extreme weather in the context of climate change (for example, based on precipitation or temperatures) and to distinguish whether they pay more attention to sudden-onset or slow-onset types of extreme weather. Based on respondents’ geolocations, we link their subjective perceptions to objective weather data to see to what extent the self-described extreme weather phenomena are aligned with objective local measures of extreme weather and whether this hinges on characteristics of their surroundings (e.g., share of local green spaces). We contribute to the question of whether extreme weather experience has the potential to increase preferences for stricter climate policies by clarifying what laypeople perceive as extreme weather. In addition, we hope to advance best practices on data integration of subjective and objective measures of environmental data.","Keywords: extreme weather, climate change, text-as-data, measurement","Franziska Quoß, Patrick W.

Crises can exacerbate traditional gender biases that lead voters to prefer masculine leadership. These biases could also result in voters evaluating female incumbents’ performance more stringently in the wake of harmful climate events. We use an original vignette experiment in South Africa to test whether female incumbents face harsher electoral accountability during a drought. We complement our experimental data with an analysis of fine-grained observational data of drought events and gendered incumbency punishment. Droughts are salient environmental crises in South Africa, and they provide voters with information about an incumbent’s competency through his or her drought response. Voters’ biases may lead to differential evaluations of male and female incumbents’ drought responses, creating gendered obstacles to maintaining office. Our findings have important implications for women’s representation, especially in the context of climate change where droughts are becoming more common and severe, particularly in the Global South. If voters are likely to punish female incumbents more harshly during drought times, then the increased prevalence of droughts may create more obstacles to women’s representation in afflicted regions.","Keywords: Gender, Environmental Disasters, Survey Experiment, Voter Behavior, South Africa","Emily Elia","Emily Elia","University of Gothenburg"," Aksel Sundström","University of Gothenburg","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Gothenburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1203_1579_1207.html","(STRATCOM) Ideological Ambiguity and Valence: A Joint Strategy for Political Success?","While ideological ambiguity has been widely studied as a political strategy, the literature offers mixed theoretical expectations and empirical results about its electoral consequences. Some scholars have argued that ambiguity increases voter uncertainty, which in turn leads to punishment by voters. In contrast, others show that it can be an effective strategy that allows a party to appeal to a broader audience. However, most studies overlook how ambiguity interacts with valence strategies—non-positional appeals emphasizing universally valued traits such as competence and trustworthiness. Building on Page's Emphasis Allocation Theory (1976), this paper explores whether emphasizing valence mitigates the costs of ideological ambiguity or even enhances its potential benefits. Using data from the 2019 European Election Studies (EES), the Euromanifesto Project, and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), I employ a multilevel linear model to analyze how ambiguity and valence jointly influence voters' propensity to vote (PTV) for political parties. The results indicate that ideological ambiguity alone is generally detrimental. However, when parties both adopt an ambiguous stance while also emphasizing their valence in the electoral manifestos, ambiguity has a positive effect on voters' perceived utility in voting for a party. This combination provides parties with a strategy to appeal broadly while maintaining a unifying message, aligning with Page's theoretical expectations.  The findings contribute to the debate on ambiguity in electoral competition and to better understand under which conditions it becomes a beneficial strategy.","Keywords: Ideological Ambiguity; Valence; Voter Behaviour","Paride Carrara","Paride Carrara",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Bologna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1204_2694_1323.html","Geographic representation","We theoretically develop and empirically study the concept of geographic representation. We identify an overlooked aspect of (mis)representation in electoral systems: The degree to which within parties, voters residing in some districts are overrepresented at the expense of their co-partisans residing elsewhere. Drawing on district-level data of 113 parties from 12 districted democracies, we find a substantial degree of geographic representational discrepancies within parties. Importantly, we show that the discrepancy is often accompanied by a difference in policy positions between under and overrepresented districts, rendering it particularly significant politically. We derive a general measure for the discrepancy between the votes a party gains and the seats it holds in different districts, namely, geographic disproportionality (GeoDisp). Unlike malapportionment, GeoDisp is party specific, and draws on actual votes. Utilizing geocoded data, we find a substantial degree of geographic disproportionality, which, per our expectations, varies by party.","Keywords: Geographic representation, districts, district magnitude,

"abstract_1205_1210_1428.html","Personality and Politics: A Comparative Analysis of Measurement Methods and Their Implications","This study examines the validity of different measurement methods for assessing personality traits and their implications for studying political preferences. While self-reports are the predominant approach in the literature, they suffer from limitations, including measurement error and reverse causality. To address these issues, alternative strategies have been proposed, such as third-party assessments (e.g., parental reports) and lagged self-reports. Using longitudinal data from the Growing Up in Ireland dataset we compare four approaches: Self-reports, parental reports, lagged self-reports, and an instrumental variable strategy using lagged self-reports as instruments for contemporaneous ones to understand how these methods capture the Big Five personality traits and their association with political attitudes.Our results reveal crucial differences between these methods. First, parental ratings of personality traits show minimal alignment with self-reported measures, both in terms of raw relationships (slopes and explained variation) and construct validity (stability over time). Parental ratings exhibit low autoregressive consistency explaining at most 5% of the variation in personality traits across waves, raising doubts about their reliability. Second, when examining the relationship between personality traits and political attitudes, self-reports and lagged self-reports provide consistent results, suggesting robustness to endogeneity concerns. However, the instrumental variable strategy significantly increases the estimated coefficients, highlighting pervasive measurement error in self-reported traits. Overall, our study highlights the limitations of third-party assessments such as parental reports and the need for researchers to carefully consider measurement error when studying personality traits and their political implications.","Keywords: Personality traits, Political preferences, Measurement methods","Maria Rubio-Cabañez","Maria Rubio-Cabañez","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"," Josep Serrano-Serrat","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1206_0527_0075.html","City Disparities and Electoral Outcomes: The Role of Urban Policy in High-Income Countries","While the urban-rural divide in political behaviour is widely discussed, divides within cities are often underestimated. Indeed, increasing inequalities in cities are reshaping the dynamics of political support, creating socio-political divides that challenge democratic stability. This research advances comparative political studies by demonstrating that urban policies can mitigate these divides and counter populist parties in high-income democracies. Using Milan's ""Piazze Aperte"" policy as a case study, the paper investigates how transforming car-dominated areas into pedestrian-friendly squares fosters social cohesion and influences electoral outcomes.Employing a difference-in-differences approach, the study examines electoral data from local (2011, 2016, 2021) and national elections (2013, 2018, 2022), employing precinct-level and neighbourhood-level data through a novel geographical interpolation statistical strategy. Hence, this analysis addresses a critical challenge in comparative politics: the absence of detailed territorial data to analyze within-city determinants of political support.Results reveal that precincts impacted by ""Piazze Aperte"" experienced reduced support for right-wing populist parties (League and Brothers of Italy) and increased votes for the center-left Democratic Party. Effects on the left-populist Movement Five Stars were mixed, and the initiative increased electoral participation, reflecting enhanced civic engagement.These findings underscore the potential of inclusive urban policies to mitigate socio-economic inequalities, reduce polarization, and promote social integration. However, further investments are essential to expand public spaces that facilitate interpersonal exchange and strengthen community ties. By addressing the roots of marginalization, this study contributes to broader debates on inequality, urban governance, and the political implications of urban design in high-income democracies.","Keywords: City Disparities, Political Behaviour, Urban Policy","Tommaso Fonti","Tommaso Fonti",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Geneva Graduate Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bulgaria consistently ranks as the European Union country with the highest corruption perception scores. This study argues that individuals' willingness to report corruption can be enhanced by exposure to information about effective anti-corruption actions taken by authorities. We test this hypothesis using a survey experiment conducted as part of a nationwide survey in Bulgaria. Participants are presented with a typical and highly realistic scenario at a vehicle inspection station where they observe a corrupt transaction and are asked about their likelihood of reporting the behavior to authorities. In this setting, the treatment group is provided with media reports detailing successful anti-corruption reforms in a neighboring municipality, achieved through public corruption reporting. Our results demonstrate that positive reinforcement through media significantly increases participants' likelihood of reporting corruption. These findings have important implications for understanding civic behavior in countries with endemic corruption and for promoting public engagement in anti-corruption efforts.","Keywords: corruption reporting, anti-corruption reforms, civic behavior, survey experiment, Bulgaria","Maria Thürk","Maria Thürk","Uppsala University","Stefanie Bailer","University of Basel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Uppsala University","University of Basel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present an alternate perspective: limited conflict – both its availability and execution – can forestall high-level conflict and facilitate credible assurances and trust-building between potential adversaries. We examine a formal model of incomplete information under shifting power, in which a rising actor has private information about the degree to which its preferences align with a declining actor’s. In round 1 the riser chooses a degree of revision against the decliner, which endogenously informs the size of the power shift. The decliner then responds with some level of preventive action that mitigates the power shift, ranging on a continuum from inaction, limited actions (""hassling""), or a full-scale war. We find that the availability of limited responses by the decliner both precludes war and allows the riser to credibly communicate its preferences by limiting or refraining from revisionist actions. Additionally, surprisingly, we find that by allowing  the rising state to conduct costly power shifts can both increase overall welfare and grant the decliner greater overall payoffs. Our findings in this more general and realistic strategic setting contradict prominent arguments that mistaken preventive war frequently occurs against rising states with no hostile intent due to incomplete information.","Keywords: Political economy, international relations, commitment problems, signalling","Peter Schram","Peter Schram","Vanderbilt University","Brandon Yoder","Australian National University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vanderbilt University","Australian National University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we analyze whether and, if so, when citizens’ opinion affects the clarity of position that the EP advances in negotiations with the Council of Ministers. We argue that when public opinion on EU policy integration across the EU member states is divided, the EP will propose less concrete changes to the Commission’s proposals. In contrast, when the views of EU citizens are more united, the EP will use more concrete language. In this way, it can strike a balance between avoiding an image of being disconnected from EU citizens given a divided public and acting as a competent and successful legislature in inter-institutional bargaining in the face of united public opinion. To test our argument, we measure the vagueness of the EPs’ legislative negotiation positions formulated in 2009-2019 using dictionary-based content analysis and draw on the Eurobarometer indicators to measure public polarization.

"abstract_1212_1039_1436.html","Who should govern? Media framing effects of election outcomes on perceived government legitimacy","The media have some leeway in portraying some political parties as winners and others as losers when reporting about election outcomes. This may be consequential for the public legitimacy of the resulting government. This paper therefore asks to what extent and how media framing of election results influences whether parties are perceived as legitimate government parties. We pre-registered several hypotheses expecting that voter exposure to predominantly positive (negative) frames of a party’s election result in media coverage will increase (decrease) the party’s perceived legitimacy as a government party and that this effect is mediated by the extent to which voters perceive the party as election winner (loser) following media reporting of election results. To test our pre-registered hypotheses, we use panel survey data from the 2021 German Federal Election and the 2023 Dutch parliamentary election. The dependent variable measures post-election whether respondents believe a party should be represented in the next government. Our mediator measures the extent to which a party has won or lost the preceding election in the respondents’ eyes. We link both surveys to content analyses of election news reporting to calculate exposure to positive (negative) frames of a party’s election result. First results suggest that while there are hardly any direct effects, media framing affects party legitimacy perceptions indirectly via winner/loser perceptions. They thereby lend partial support to our hypotheses and have important implications for research on election fairness and losers’ consent following democratic elections.","Keywords: elections, government formation, legitimacy, media effects, public opinion","Katjana Gattermann, Thomas Meyer","Katjana Gattermann","University of Amsterdam","Thomas Meyer","University of Vienna","Linda Bos","University of Amsterdam","Alessandro Nai","University of Amsterdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Disentangling Partisan, Local, and Fairness Considerations","Previous research has explained citizens' support for electoral reform with partisan self-interest and perceived procedural fairness. However, electoral reforms also affect the geographic distribution of officeholders, raising important questions about local representation. If citizens are self-interested and value local representation, they will prefer electoral systems that not only maximize their preferred party's prospects but also increase the number of representatives from their local district compared to others. Past studies were unable to disentangle local and partisan considerations because the electoral reforms they examined did not alter these dimensions separately.We address this limitation by studying citizens’ reactions to a recent electoral reform in Germany. This reform creates the possibility that district candidates may not secure a seat in the Bundestag, even if they win the most votes in their electoral district. As a result, the reform creates quasi-random variation in the distribution of representatives across districts, enabling us to disentangle citizens’ local considerations from their partisan and fairness considerations.Our pre-registered analysis draws on original survey instruments and a vignette experiment conducted with the German Internet Panel shortly after the 2025 federal election (N = 3,000). We present quasi-experimental and survey-experimental evidence to separate partisan, local, and fairness considerations. We contrast these findings with candidate preferences on the same reform using data from the GLES candidate study.

"abstract_1218_0192_0172.html","Slavery, Colonialism, and Autocracy in sub-Saharan Africa","There is a fascinating empirical sub-literature on the long-term impact of slave raiding in Africa that suggests that slave raiding had a greater negative impact on African development than colonialism.  However, there are some analytical problems.  The sub-literature recognizes the difference between slave raiding (estimated by the number of slaves exported from various places) and slavery in Africa (estimated by the proportion of a current state overlapping with historical slave labor practice) but has made no effort to untangle their possible different effects.  Another problem is that the literature on colonialism has become more sophisticated recently with elaborate theories of how colonial impacts varied.   It is one thing to operationalize colonial effect by whether or not a colony existed and for how long.  It is another to assess how slavery shaped colonial differences. A third problem is that while a number of developmental processes have been examined, autocratization tends not to be one of them – perhaps because the sub-literature is predominately characterized by econometric analyses with greater interest in economic growth variance. In other words, new arguments about how colonial circumstances varied and the absence of autocracy as a dependent variable invite a renewed inquiry into the relative impacts of slavery and colonialism.in the African experience over the past 500 years. We regress historical data on slave raiding and slavery into Lee and Paine’s (2024) model of colonial origins of democracy and dictatorship and in turn to contemporary VDem data on autocratic variation in sub-Saharan Africa.","Keywords: slavery

"abstract_1219_0322_0078.html","Linguistic rights and the borders of political identity","This paper revisits a classic question for scholars of government and politicians: how is the behavior of cultural or ethnic groups affected by the formal institutions that regulate their rights? While the literature has demonstrated that state-sanctioned discrimination or forced assimilation into a majoritarian identity often produces backlash among minority members, I study the consequences of accommodating minority rights, focusing on one important dimension: the status of minority language. I exploit a regional linguistic reform in post-transition Spain: in 1986 the Spanish province of Navarra allocated municipalities into one of three linguistic zones, each with a different degree of normalization of the Basque language in the public sphere.  I study the effects of differential linguistic rights on the identity choices of Basque and Spanish speakers, the making of group boundaries, and the forms of political participation until today. With granular sub-municipal data and a Geographic RDD, I find that crossing the administrative border of the bilingual zone increases the vote shares of Basque nationalist parties, at the expense of traditional Spanish parties. With a Difference-in-Differences design and historical election data, I then study how the reform induced diverging patterns in voting behavior across formerly politically homogenous areas. Exploring the causal mechanisms, I find evidence of attempts at reshaping the public space by translating street names into Basque. I then track identity choices across generations with data on Basque names and surnames in municipal election lists and with surveys on linguistic preferences.","Keywords: language, minorities, identity, nationalism, separatism","Giacomo Lemoli","Giacomo Lemoli",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1220_0015_0384.html","Repertoires of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence and Their Effects on Social Trust","During and in the aftermath of conflict, social trust is a vital component of maintaining resilient communities and, ultimately, rebuilding social and state institutions. Yet trust is also fragile. This work contributes to the growing body of literature assessing the ways in which the violence of armed conflict undermines it. I analyse the effects of various forms of conflict-related sexual violence on the levels of generalized trust in society in a large-n cross-country analysis of annual data for the period from 1989 through 2010 and find that the effects of conflict-related sexual violence on social trust are distinct from those of other (lethal) forms of civilian victimisation. The results indicate that the hitherto conventional operationalization of conflict-related sexual violence as homogeneous “rape” obscures important variation in its effect. Forms of sexual violence with a longer temporal horizon which are more commonly in the repertoire of non-state groups and can be jointly categorized as sexual enslavement, such as forced marriages or forced prostitution, have a consistently negative effect on the societal levels of trust. Conversely, highly violent forms akin to torture with a shorter temporal horizon, more commonly perpetrated by state forces, have a positive effect on the level of trust in a society.","Keywords: social trust, generalized trust, one-sided violence, enslavement, torture","Marta Antonova","Marta Antonova",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Berne, CH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1221_0239_0463.html","Why Do We Protest? For a Comprehensive Explanatory Multi-Level Model","While numerous studies have examined the reasons behind people’s decision to engage in protests, existing literature lacks a comprehensive model that consolidates previous findings and thoroughly investigates these causes. There is, thus, a need for experimental tools to establish conditional associations and build a case for causal inference in this area of research. Developing such a model could aid in predicting protests and support efforts to address grievances, potentially preventing violent conflicts. To address this gap, this project adopts an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from political science, psychology, sociology and conflict studies, to explore the factors that lead people to protest within authoritarian regimes. Specifically, it examines how contextual factors such as economic deprivation and political repression influence individuals' willingness to protest, and how individual factors like emotions (anger, frustration, fear) and rational calculations mediate this relationship. The proposed model positions contextual factors as the primary drivers, with individual factors acting as mediators rather than direct causes, while also considering moderators like identity, elite divisions, and belief in conspiracy theories. To empirically test this model, we utilize a large-scale survey experiment with a total sample size of 18,000 participants (3,000 per country) across six Arab countries: Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. This experimental design allows us to comprehensively investigate the variables and establish casual relationships between contextual factors and protest readiness., as proposed.","Keywords: Protests, MENA Region, Survey Experiment, Comprehensive Model","Abdelkarim Amengay","Ibrahim Khatib","Doha Institute for Graduate Studies","Abdelkarim Amengay","Doha Institute for Graduate Studies","Mazen Hassan","Cairo University","Mark Tessler","University of Michigan","","","","","","","","","","","","","Doha Institute for Graduate Studies","Cairo University","University of Michigan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from MP-Speaker Interactions in the Dutch House of Representatives (2012-2024)","To what extent does the far right stick to the democratic rules of the game? While we know much about their norm-breaching rhetoric, we know less about their norm-breaching behavior in an institutional context. I study this in the context of parliamentary debate. I focus on interactions between MPs and the Speaker of the House in the Dutch House of Representatives (2012-2024). This case is unique because far-right actors have assumed both norm-adherent (MP) and norm-enforcement (Speaker) roles. My analysis leverages the as-if random rotation of Speaker duties across parliamentary sessions where nearly 1 in 5 sessions in the last decade were chaired by the far right.  Combining several data sources, I measure (i) when parliamentary norms are breached and (ii) when parliamentary norm breaches are sanctioned by the Speaker. I will use a generalized difference-in-differences model to estimate the effect of switching from a mainstream to a far-right Speaker on the enforcement of parliamentary norms. From an adherence perspective (descriptive), I expect that far-right MPs breach more norms than mainstream MPs, as such breaches align with their anti-establishment views. From an enforcement perspective (causal), I expect far-right Speakers to tolerate more norm breaches by party members to advance electoral goals. This study is one of the first to systematically analyze the behavior of the Speaker of the House, an influential political office largely understudied in political science. I demonstrate how this role is pivotal in safeguarding democratic norms.","Keywords: Parliamentary norms,

"abstract_1223_1073_0676.html","The mobilization of young voters: Evidence from a large-scale field experiment","Can parties mobilize young people by sending letters to first-time voters? Parties are in a constant competition for new voters. First-time voters are a particularly attractive target group as their first vote choice has a long-lasting effect on partisanship. A common and costly instrument that many parties use are mailed letters, in which they directly appeal to first-time voters. However, it is unclear whether such letters really have the potential to mobilize young citizens. We address this question by causally identifying the effect of party letters on turnout and vote intention of first-time voters. We conducted a large-scale field experiment in collaboration with the German Green party in the context of the European Parliament Election in 2024. Overall, 37,000 letters were sent to first-time voters in the city of Berlin. We randomized which first-time voters receive a letter based on the zip code area in which they reside. We find no effects on turnout or the party’s vote share in the treated localities. These findings are complemented with an individual-level analysis based on a post-election survey that we fielded among first-time voters. The study makes an important contribution to our understanding of political mobilization, political campaigning more generally and about political mobilization of young voters in particular.","Keywords: field experiment, mobilization, participation, young voters","Frederik Thieme","Frederik Thieme","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"," Heike Klüver","Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our answer is that there is both a political and partisan component to perceptions of inflation. While it seems to be the case that there is little difference in perceptions of either current or future inflation rates along party lines, there are sizable differences along party lines when it comes to attributing the causes of inflation. Furthermore, it is also the case that perceptions of inflation vary strongly and consistently by one’s income. Less well-off voters see inflation as being much higher than do the better-off. This effect is one that reinforces the relevance of recent discussions on the calculation of measures of inflation and underscores the point that there are heterogenous affects across the electorate in the political economy of inflation. Taken together, these results suggest that rather than talking about “the” economy we might better recognize the variation in experience and understanding in economic circumstances. It is not that – in terms of experiences and understanding - there are multiple economies, but there are sizable differences in what voters see taking place – and why it is taking place.","Keywords: voting and the economy

This paper investigates the connection between changes in housing rents and prices and voting patterns for anti-establishment parties in Spain, using precinct-level data from General Elections. Given Spain’s high homeownership rate and the widespread view of property as a savings investment, we hypothesize that declines in housing values since the housing bubble have led individuals to feel poorer and vote against traditional parties. Conversely, rising housing values likely strengthen support for establishment parties, a phenomenon that reveals rural-urban variations in voting patterns. We also explore the role of the rental market in shaping voting behavior. Rising rents are expected to have divergent effects on support for left- and right-wing populist parties, depending on the distribution of housing market pressures and the potential economic gains for homeowners in touristic areas.","Keywords: housing market, voting ehaviour, rental prices, anti-establisment parties","Pablo Simón","Pablo Simón","Carlos III University - IC","Mariona Segú","JM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carlos III University - IC","JM","THEMA - CY Cergy Paris Université",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1227_1233_0689.html","United We Stand, Divided We Fall: Mainstream Party Agreement and Vote Switching to Competitors","Does mainstream party agreement on divisive issues reduce vote switching to competitors? The literature on party competition emphasizes mainstream parties’ incentives to converge toward the median voter. Recent findings suggest that convergence along the left-right ideological scale can repel voters. This paper challenges such assumptions by arguing that mainstream party agreement on salient and divisive issues, like immigration, stabilizes voter support by altering the dynamics of political competition. Specifically, agreement fosters valence-based competition, where parties compete on competence and credibility, while divergence intensifies conflict, polarizes voters, and increases defections to competitors. To test this argument, the paper constructs an innovative dataset combining panel survey data from the GLES with fine-grained measures of German parliamentarians' issue stances on Twitter. Using Natural Language Inference (NLI), it tracks shifts in immigration positions over time and introduces a novel measure of agreement between mainstream parties. The analysis reveals that when mainstream parties align on immigration stances, they not only reduce the likelihood of vote switching to far-right competitors but also attract disillusioned voters back to the mainstream. These effects are most pronounced when immigration salience is high, highlighting the strategic importance of message alignment. The findings have significant implications for understanding electoral dynamics in multiparty systems. Agreement on divisive issues can serve as a powerful, yet underexplored, tool for mainstream parties to stabilize support, counter voter defection, and challenge the rise of far-right competitors. This study underscores the need to move beyond simplistic convergence theories and explore how issue-based coordination can reshape political competition.","Keywords: Mainstream Party Agreement, Natural Language Processing, Vote Switching, Immigration, Valence-Based Competition","Luis Sattelmayer","Luis Sattelmayer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Center for European Studies and Comparative Politics, SciencesPo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1228_0137_0844.html","Parties and the People: Why and When Do Parties Support Direct Democracy?","During every crisis of representative democracy, there is a surge of demands for more direct forms of participation. Whether it is the populist movement at the end of the 19th century in the US or the Five Star Movement in current-day Italy -- discontent with the representative system increases demands for alternative institutions. But what explains the position of the main actors in the formulation of these demands? In this paper, we ask why political parties call for direct democracy. We provide two major motivations: ideology and strategy. Analyzing national party manifestos of European parties from 1946 onward using our novel supervised machine learning classifier (transformer model), we show how ideological and strategic motivations seem to account for most variation in party positions towards direct democracy. From a strategic perspective, we find that challenger parties are the main advocates of direct democracy. Ideologically, it is mainly culturally liberal positions that are  positively correlated with support for direct democracy even after parties have lost the strategic incentives to support it. These results contribute to the literature on institutional origins and sheds light on the motivation of a central political actor, parties, when it comes to the introduction of direct democratic institutions.","Keywords: Direct Democracy, Party Manifestos","Lucas Leemann","Sarah Engler","Leuphana University Lüneburg,","Lucas Leemann","University of Zurich","Florian Schaffner","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leuphana University Lüneburg,","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1229_0894_0916.html","The winner takes it all. How great powers' investment attractiveness shapes UN votes","Does competition between great powers to attract investments shape UN votes? Recent research has examined how Chinese financing influences countries' political choices. However, few studies have focused on how investments in China and competition to attract or restrict such money flow affect countries' international stances.This paper fills this gap by investigating how investments directed to China or the USA influence countries' voting behaviour on the UN General Assembly (UNGA). Investments make countries vulnerable to the recipients' political decisions, and these vulnerabilities might drive them to accommodate political stances. Yet, this is conditional to the major recipient. Countries align with the Chinese position at the UNGA if the most significant share is directed to China; conversely, they associate with Washington if the largest share is headed there.We employ a large-N study that combines UNGA votes and investment stock in China and the US. Using logit analyses, we examine each vote between 2000 and 2018 to determine whether countries aligned with China's opposition to the US and vice versa. Our findings confirm our expectations, showing a robust correlation between the share of investment and vote alignment. Interestingly, regime type does not appear to moderate this effect.Thus, this paper contributes to the debate on foreign investments and great power competition by adopting a point-of-view so far neglected. Indeed, it shows that, alongside investments from great powers, those directed to them are also important. As such, this article has important policy implications, helping policymakers better predict countries' behaviours at the UNGA.","Keywords: UN votes, Foreign Direct Investments, Great Power competition","Francesco Baraldi","Francesco Baraldi","University of Genoa"," Mattia Sguazzini","University of Genoa"," Marco Di Giulio","University of Genoa","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Genoa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

GENPOL","While there is limited knowledge on how the mainstream right (PP) engages with gender issues in Spain, even less is known about how it contrasts with the radical right’s (VOX) strategy to capitalize on modern sexism, particularly among young men. Previous research has highlighted how radical right parties globally target incel communities and the so-called ""manosphere,"" exploiting narratives of male grievance. Studies have also demonstrated that modern sexist attitudes are significant predictors of radical right voting. However, this study is the first quantitative analysis to explore how sexual frustration moderates the effect of modern sexist attitudes on electoral preferences.Focusing on young voters, the results reveal that for young male VOX supporters, modern sexism becomes a powerful predictor of voting behavior when coupled with personal frustrations related to sexual dissatisfaction. The study examines key moderating factors such as the desire to have a partner, affective-sexual dissatisfaction, and pornography consumption. Among these, sexual frustration amplifies the explanatory power of sexist attitudes, making VOX particularly appealing to those who feel personally aggrieved by feminism. This dynamic does not hold for PP voters, whose voting behavior is less influenced by personal grievances of this nature.Our findings provide new insights into the ways in which VOX attracts young men, distinguishing it from PP. By capitalizing on male frustrations and combining them with anti-feminist rhetoric, VOX consolidates a base of support rooted in the private sphere, where sexual dissatisfaction fuels radical right voting.","Keywords: Sexual frustration; Anti-feminism; Radical right vote; Mainstream right vote; Youth vote","Álvaro Calvo-Rodríguez","Álvaro Calvo-Rodríguez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidade da Coruña",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the case of China, I show how the state counters external threats by employing anti-foreign media propaganda. To quantify anti-foreign media propaganda, I apply a semi-supervised scaling method to over 20,000 Chinese state media articles from 2003 to 2022 that mention foreign media. I find that hostile framing sharply increased from 2019 and disproportionately targets media outlets from the US and the UK. Further, leveraging a period of tense Sino-British ties for hypothesis testing, I find that anti-foreign media propaganda appears to be activated in response to foreign policy disputes, and can differentiate between targets.

In several cases, however, far-right parties register sharp gains in vote share over relatively short intervals. What explains sudden increases in far right support? We evaluate this puzzle in the context of the Netherlands, where the far-right, populist Freedom Party (PVV) more than doubled its share between the 2021 and 2023 general elections, becoming the biggest party in the Dutch parliament. We find no evidence in support of standard explanations. Change in municipalities’ far-right vote share does not correlate with exposure to Ukrainian refugees, a plausibly exogenous source of new migrants, or proxies for housing costs. Our findings are instead consistent with backlash from small businesses owners required to repay COVID relief funds.

We then classify these responses using sentiment analysis and speech emotion recognition techniques.  Our findings demonstrate a substantial presence of negative sentiment when respondents evaluate political trust. Moreover, the sentiment conveyed in these responses significantly impacts trust scores, with positive sentiment bolstering trust and negative sentiment leading to its decline. A more granular examination of emotions reveals limited variation with only one notable effect where respondents employing ""happy"" language and paralinguistics exhibited higher trust scores.

We examine this question by studying the consequences of targeted authoritarian interventions during the military government in Brazil (1964-1985). The interventions replaced popularly elected mayors with appointees in certain municipalities, while allowing others to continue directly electing their mayors. Using a dataset that combines more than twenty years of public opinion data on attitudes towards democracy with spatial variation on the sites of intervention (21,099 individuals located in 662 distinct municipalities), we identify the impact of intervention by comparing the attitudes of individuals who experienced intervention during the key period of political socialization (late childhood to early adulthood) to individuals living in the same municipalities who did not experience intervention during this period. We find that experiencing intervention during these impressionable years leads to a small but statistically significant reduction in the valorization of democracy later in life.","Keywords: democratic attitudes; appointed mayors; political socialization; Brazil; authoritarianism","Daniel Gingerich","Beatriz Costa","University of Virginia"," Daniel Gingerich","University of Virginia","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Virginia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our data includes the 1986 Spanish NATO referendum, monthly surveys with voting and pro-war attitudes, and political speeches in Congress. We use two empirical strategies, a continuous differences-in-differences estimation anda repeated cross-section model including a large set of controls, to see the political effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Spain according to historic support for NATO. We find that the Russia-Ukraine conflict increased by around 5pp the current intention to vote for the center-right (Partido Popular--PP) among the individuals in municipalities that strongly supported NATO in the 1986 referendum. We argue that the Russian invasion of Ukraine—the second largest Soviet republic—has heightened NATO’s prominence, revivingits historical role in the US-Russia conflict. Hence, these pro-NATO attitudes measured in 1986 channel anti-Russian sentiments (derived from the anti-Soviet origins of NATO). As a matter of fact, in those municipalities, individuals have lower ``sympathy"" for Russia and stronger perception of the country as a military threat. Finally, the increase in the voting intention for the PP goes hand in hand with the legislators' narrative in Congress: after the invasion, PP legislators are more likely to mention Russia in their speeches, and when they do, they talk more negatively about it. In this setting, we do not find evidence that support for NATO reflects different opinions of the Spanish citizens, such as pro-military attitudes or a general mood for supranational integration.","Keywords: Public Opinion, International Organizations, NATO, Russia, Ukraine","Federico Curci","Federico Curci","CUNEF Universidad; Ministerio de Economía, Comercio y Empresa","Agustin Casas","CUNEF Universidad","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CUNEF Universidad","Ministerio de Economía, Comercio y Empresa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since the 2022 Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian LGBTQ+ communities have faced an ambivalent situation and have resorted to a wide variety of actions to seek to (non)violently undermine non-egalitarian power relations. Following the ABC framework of resistance, this study aims to collect data on the expressions of queer (non)violent resistance in armed conflict, within the context of the War in Ukraine, to explore and comprehend, in an entangled way, how these forms of queer struggle are manifested, intertwined, and in an ongoing dialogue with power. An analysis of social media content concerning Ukrainian violent and nonviolent resistance is developed and complemented by individual semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in queer nonviolent activism in Ukraine. This project results in a set of narratives about these forms of queer agency, involving multiple themes, that inform about how these acts of resistance both undermine and reinforce power relations in contexts of armed conflict, as well as how they entangle each other in (non)violent ways. Such results allow for a wider discussion on how Ukrainian queer violent and nonviolent resistance may inform the debate regarding the conceptualization of resistance acts, the resistance-resistance, and the resistance-power nexuses, as well as the potentialities, limitations, and intersections between forms of queer struggle during an armed conflict.","Keywords: resistance, LGBTQ+, (non)violence, war, Ukraine","Daniel Santos","Daniel Santos",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Master's Student at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we investigate whether pro-social bystander reactions to online hate can be effectively mobilized through an intervention message. We conduct two large scale studies (N = 5176) using an immersive mock social media setup to probe the effectiveness of different intervention messages in increasing reporting and constructive counter speech. Study 1 is an intervention tournament of five different intervention messages. Study 2 uses a US nationally representative sample to investigate the longevity of the most effective message identified in Study 1 in video form. We find that our intervention can fosters upwards of a six-fold increase in reporting behavior and constructive counterspeech. Effects on reporting hold even after four weeks, with participants reporting 2.5 times more. Finally, although base differences in responses to hateful content exist among various groups (e.g. political leaning), we find that the intervention message increases prosocial conduct across these groups. Together, our study presents an important step in creating an effective and scalable intervention to increase prosocial behavior online.","Keywords: online hate, bystander reactions, counterspeech,","Lasse Lindekilde","Simon Tobias Karg","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Tanja Marie Hansen","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Jesper Rasmussen","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University"," Lasse Lindekilde","Department of Political Science, Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1239_1161_0529.html","Measuring Personal Attacks in Parliamentary Debates","Understanding how political elites relate to each other in political discourse is crucial for understanding the dynamics of compromise, conflict, and polarization. This paper studies elite relations from the perspective of politicians’ actor-targeted rhetoric in parliamentary debates, focusing on which parliamentary actors speakers mention and the polarity of these statements. While current research has explored group-based rhetoric in political communication, studies have been limited by their reliance on manual content analysis and predominantly English-language focus, particularly affecting comparative research across languages and political contexts. We address three key challenges in analyzing actor-centric rhetoric: the lack of automation, limited multilingual capabilities, and high resource requirements. Our solution introduces a new method for automatically identifying political actor mentions and their polarity in debates, reducing the need for manual annotations and computational resources. Our approach offers three main contributions: First, we develop a new multilingual dataset (English, German, and Spanish) with annotations for actor-centric utterances and debate polarization, including coding for different political actor categories. Second, we adapt an open-source LLM (LLaMA) using training data from one language, employing LoRA-adapter-training to minimize computational needs. Third, we validate our cross-lingual approach using labeled datasets in German and Spanish, demonstrating that our task-adapted LLM can enhance training data across languages through language-agnostic task representation. We train a compact student RoBERTa model for lightweight analysis and compare our method against various baselines, including zero- and few-shot prompting. Our approach enables efficient, large-scale comparisons of political actors' engagement across languages and national contexts while maintaining methodological rigor.","Keywords: actor-centric rhetoric, multilingual dataset, polarization, LLMs","Christopher Klamm","Christopher Klamm","University of Cologne","Hauke Licht","University of Innsbruck","Sven-Oliver Proksch","University of Cologne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Cologne","University of Innsbruck",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1240_1368_0673.html","How Effective Are Parties at Mobilizing Supporters? Evidence from Six Large-Scale Experiments with 400,000 Party Supporters","Extensive research on voter persuasion has often yielded null results, leading political parties to focus on mobilizing their core supporters. These key supporters are theoretically essential for linking parties to the electorate. Yet, causal evidence remains limited regarding the effectiveness of real-world party messages in influencing their core supporters’ behavior.To address this gap, we conducted six pre-registered, large-scale experiments in partnership with a major political party in Romania. The experiments surveyed nearly 400,000 core supporters (over half of the party’s votes in the 2024 European elections) during the 2024 Romanian European, presidential, and parliamentary elections. Based on more than 68,000 responses, our findings show that messages designed to appeal to ingroup or outgroup partisan identities have substantively small and statistically insignificant effects on voter mobilization. Self-reported and behavioral measures confirm these results. While strategic voting messages show relatively stronger mobilization effects, their overall impact remains substantively limited.Our study provides causal evidence that political parties struggle to design messages that effectively activate their core supporters during campaigns. This challenges the assumption that parties inherently know how to mobilize their voters and highlights the need for further research into what strategies genuinely drive core supporter engagement, particularly in the context of underperforming party messages.","Keywords: Electoral mobilization, Electoral campaigns, Party supporters, Romania","Costin Ciobanu","Costin Ciobanu","Aarhus University","Krzysztof Krakowski","King’s College London","Dani Sandu","University of Fribourg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","King’s College London","University of Fribourg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1241_0494_0273.html","The effect of political cohesion on taxation in developing democracies","How does political power shape tax collection? While the relationship between regime type and taxation has been widely studied, little is known about the impact of political strength on fiscal capacity within democracies. This article addresses this question by examining how the legislative power of governments in developing democracies affects the level and structure of tax revenues. Drawing on Levi (1989) 'theory of predatory rule', I test the hypotheses that an increase in the government's legislative support leads to higher tax revenues and that the effect varies by tax type. Specifically, I posit that governments with a dominant position in the legislature focus on increasing revenues from the value-added tax due to cost-benefit considerations. Employing fixed effects regression models and matching with difference-in-differences, the results provide strong support for the second hypothesis and partial support for the first hypothesis. These findings illustrate the importance of executive-legislative cohesion in explaining variation in the fiscal performance of contemporary developing democracies.","Keywords: political economy, comparative politics, government, taxation, democracy","Guy Heilbrun","Guy Heilbrun",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"King's College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Citizen (Mis)Perceptions of Party Policy Positions","Misperceiving party positions can lead voters to support parties that do not align with their preferences, undermining proximity and policy-based voting. Yet, the extent and origins of these misperceptions remain underexplored. Existing research mostly focuses on broad dimensions, like the left-right scale, which lack clear benchmarks for identifying misperceptions. This paper addresses these gaps by examining perceptions of party positions on specific policies, such as income taxes. Using original data from a panel survey experiment in Austria, I employ close-ended questions with single correct answers and parties' responses to a Voting Advice Application as benchmarks to measure misperceptions of party policy positions. The study has two main goals: (1) to quantify misperceptions about party positions by distinguishing between guesses and stable incorrect beliefs, and (2) to assess whether information about broad party stances helps citizens infer parties' specific policy positions. The findings contribute to our understanding of how voters form perceptions of party positions and translate general political messages into specific policy expectations, with broader implications for democratic accountability and party communication strategies.","Keywords: party positions, public opinion, representation, issue salience, heuristics","Beatriz Lasheras Mas","Beatriz Lasheras Mas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Effect of Coalitions with Populist Parties in Parliamentary Elections","Mainstream parties in Europe increasingly face a dilemma about whether to include populist parties in government coalitions. This has motivated a growing literature about the consequences of implementing cordons sanitaires versus tainted coalitions. This article contributes to this literature by addressing the question of whether mainstream parties tend to gain or lose vote share when they form coalition governments with populists. Building on the populism and cost of governing literatures, we explore two competing hypotheses. The “anti-populist flak” hypothesis is that voters punish mainstream parties that ally with populists because they are perceived as having betrayed democratic norms. The “big tent” hypothesis contends that—rather than being punished—mainstream parties can tap into populist support by adding them to their coalitions. Moreover, we test various mechanisms for this effect: ideological extremism of the populist party, the existence of parliamentary majorities, and intra-cabinet conflict. Using data from ParlGov and Klüver and Spoon, the preliminary results suggest that mainstream parties perform better when forming coalitions with populist junior partners.","Keywords: political parties, populism, coalitions, elections, voting, government","Marco Pastor Mayo","Marco Pastor Mayo","Free University of Berlin","Pedro Riera","University Carlos III of Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Free University of Berlin","University Carlos III of Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1244_0735_0779.html","Crisis and boundary change in the European Union","Crises are important turning points in the process of regional integration. While threatening polities in the making with disintegration, they create opportunities for further political development (Schmitter 1970, Skowronek 1982). In this paper, we study boundary change (“bordering”), an important marker of polity formation in the Rokkanian tradition, in the crisis period of European integration. In response to a crisis, the EU has the option to change its internal or external boundaries or both. Moreover, it can change by increasing or decreasing boundary closure and boundary control. We assume that the specific direction of crisis-induced boundary change depends on the nature of the crisis.Specifically, we build on the typological distinction between “failures” and “attacks” (Schimmelfennig 2024). Failures originate in unanticipated policy shocks that expose flaws in policy design and capacity deficits. By contrast, attacks result from political resistance against the polity’s identity, fundamental values, and constitutional principles. We hypothesize that, whereas the EU reacts to failures by increasing boundary control (i.e., allocating additional competencies and resources to the EU), the response to attacks is increasing boundary closure towards the attacker and opening boundaries towards the community's defenders. We distinguish between exogenous and endogenous crises changing the external and internal boundaries respectively. Finally, we distinguish between symmetrical and asymmetrical crises, with the expectation that the former are more likely to significantly change boundaries. To trace these changes, we use the EUROBORD Boundary Configuration dataset, tracking shifts in boundary closure and control across multiple crises and challenges that vary in nature.","Keywords: EU, crisis, borders, policy change, integration","Alessia Invernizzi, Frank Schimmelfennig","Alessia Invernizzi","ETH Züruich"," Frank Schimmelfennig","ETH Züruich","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"ETH Züruich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1245_0350_0841.html","Switching Horses: Party Performance and Leadership Survival","Party leaders wield considerable influence as some of the most powerful political figures within parliamentary democracies. In pursuit of the party’s objectives, they possess significant powers related to the day-to-day management of the party organization, formulation of policy preferences, and selection of candidates for public office. Simultaneously, parties hold leaders accountable for their actions, replacing them when their performance endangers the party’s electoral opportunities. Previous studies on the factors influencing party leaders' survival primarily focused on stable institutional mechanisms that govern the relationship between the party leader and the party's decision-makers or the leader's electoral performance. However, party insiders often rely on other cues to assess a leader's potential success. We propose that opinion polls are one of those indicators. Specifically, we test that party leaders are likelier to exit office prematurely when their party's performance in public opinion polls is poor. Moreover, we anticipate that intra-party institutions and intra-party divisions to moderate the role of polls. Empirically, we employ survival analysis to test the effect of opinion polling on party leaders’ survival in a sample of over 269 party leaders from 47 political parties in 9 parliamentary democracies since 1950. Our results confirm that better results in pre-electoral polls increase the chances of leadership survival.","Keywords: Intra-party politics, Party leaders, Polls, Survival analysis","Federico Acarregui, Javier Martinez Canto","Federico Acarregui","Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain","Javier Martinez Canto","Universidad de Salamanca, Spain; IBEI, Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain","Universidad de Salamanca, Spain","IBEI, Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Indeed, Russia and China have historically framed sanctions as illegitimate interferences with state sovereignty. Now, China and Russia are increasingly pushing back against this hegemony. In 2021 both have adopted laws on adopting economic sanctions, institutionalizing their deployment of these instruments. However, economic sanctions research continues to predominantly take the perspective of Western actors like the US, the EU, and the UN. While existing datasets document hundreds of sanctions by Western countries, they record only a limited number from Russia and China. Unlike these existing datasets, which rely exclusively on English-language sources, we draw on thousands of original governmental and non-governmental documents in Russian and Chinese. This approach has allowed us to identify over 180 instances of economic sanctions imposed by Russia and China between 2000 and 2023, with a marked increase in recent years. Recognizing that Russia and China have historically framed sanctions as illegitimate interferences with state sovereignty, we pay particular attention to the motives and narratives they now use to justify their actions. Our findings challenge the perception that Russia and China are reluctant users of economic sanctions and shed light on the rhetorical strategies they employ to depict their sanctions as “countermeasures” rather than offensive actions.","Keywords: economic sanctions, russia, china, new data","Claas Mertens","Linda Liu","Stanford University","Claas Mertens","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(GENPOL)","Recent academic analyses report that young people are increasingly aligning themselves with right-wing positions, more so than the youth of past decades. This evidence is further supported by studies showing a growing trend of young people voting for radical right-wing parties, a phenomenon that was far less common a decade ago. The right-wing appeal is particularly strong among young males, many of whom are embracing narratives that dismiss gender inequality and support xenophobic and anti-immigration policies. But why is this happening? Is it contributing to explain the gender ideological divide among Spanish young people?Although several potential explanations exist, one prominent hypothesis has gained traction in the public sphere: social media could be influencing young people’s political ideologies. We argue that social media influences young people more than traditional media for several theoretical reasons. To summarize: social media consumption is highly individualized and often occurs without family involvement, which has traditionally been a key agent in political socialization and the development of both ideological beliefs and party identification.To test this hypothesis, we have access to panel data from TRI-POL, a three-wave survey conducted as part of a project led by Mariano Torcal focusing on the Spanish case. This data allows us to examine whether increased social media consumption correlates with shifts in individual ideological preferences, particularly toward right-wing positions. The dataset includes detailed information on specific social media platforms, levels of consumption, and various measures of ideology and party identification.","Keywords: Social media, social networks, ideology, young people, left-right","LUIS RAMOS, IRENE SÁNCHEZ-VÍTORES","LUIS RAMOS","UNIVERSIDAD REY JUAN CARLOS"," IRENE SÁNCHEZ-VÍTORES","UNIVERSIDAD REY JUAN CARLOS"," JAVIER LORENTE","UNIVERSIDAD REY JUAN CARLOS","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UNIVERSIDAD REY JUAN CARLOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the commonality of foreign intermediaries in Chinese, Russian, or Iranian state media, the impact of these foreign intermediaries on audiences remains unclear. We conducted two survey experiments with approximately 4,800 respondents in mainland China and the United States, randomly exposing participants to soft propaganda videos featuring either American or Chinese speakers discussing positively the extent of freedom and safety they feel exists in China and praising its political model. Our findings show that foreign advocates do not enhance the effectiveness of authoritarian propaganda among Chinese audiences. However, Americans are more influenced by propaganda messages delivered by a fellow American than by a Chinese messenger. This demonstrates that ``useful idiots” are effective at improving perceptions of authoritarian rule among Western but not domestic Chinese audiences. Our findings show how autocracies can build global support through foreign intermediaries which, given currently heightened geopolitical competition, has implications for democratic resilience.","Keywords: Propaganda, Authoritarianism, China, Foreign Influence","Lachlan McNamee","Lachlan McNamee","Monash University","Siyu Liang","UCLA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monash University","UCLA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Impact of Economic Grievances in Formative Years on Far-Right Support in Adulthood","Does early-life exposure to economic uncertainty fuel a persistent fear of economic decline, increasing far-right support in adulthood? While macro-level studies have established a link between economic crises and far-right support, micro-level evidence on the relationship between individuals' current economic situation and far-right voting is scarce. I test one possible explanation for this puzzle: that exposure to major labor market shocks during childhood and adolescence fosters status anxiety, increasing receptivity to far-right appeals in adulthood. I build on political socialization theory, which highlights formative years as a critical period for the formation of stable, long-term political attitudes. Leveraging longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP, 1984–2022) and historical regional unemployment data, I combine early-life local unemployment rates with political behavior in adulthood to assess the enduring impact of early-life economic conditions on voting for the far-right. Germany provides a compelling case: Post-reunification labor market transformations produced significant regional economic disparities—a context in which now middle-aged cohorts, disproportionately represented among German far-right supporters, were socialized. By linking early-life exposure to structural labor market risks with adult political outcomes, this study moves beyond individual current economic conditions to explain far-right support. It has implications for research on political behavior and the long-term political impact of economic crises.","Keywords: far-right support, political economy, voting behavior, labor market risk, political socialization","Franziska Veit","Franziska Veit",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Humboldt University of Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, studies show that politicians' responsiveness tends to be selective, with certain groups and issues receiving more attention than others. What drives politicians to prioritise certain public opinion signals while overlooking others? This study aims to explore a potential factor contributing to this phenomenon by examining the mechanisms through which politicians translate public preferences into political action. We posit that politicians will use certain criteria against which they test public opinion signals to determine their weight. Signals that are valued more positively will carry more weight and hence increase politicians’ willingness to act accordingly. Conversely, information that is negatively appraised is more likely to be disregarded, resulting in a smaller impact on politicians' behavior. Drawing on survey and interview data from politicians across 12 countries, we will examine what criteria politicians judge to be the most important when evaluating public opinion signals. Ultimately, the results of our study will give us a better understanding of how responsiveness comes about and why it sometimes falls short.","Keywords: Policy responsiveness, public opinion, political elites","Chris Butler","Bart Maes","University of Antwerp"," Chris Butler","University of Antwerp"," Stefaan Walgrave","University of Antwerp","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Antwerp",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

EU Attitudes and Policy Demands after Coming of Age during Europe’s Multiple Crises","This paper examines how experiencing key life transitions during Europe’s multiple crises —the Eurocrisis, COVID-19, and the lingering social crisis— have shaped young Europeans’ attitudes. The youngest generations of voters have navigated formative transitions like entering the workforce, cohabiting, or becoming parents against the backdrop of Europe’s economic and political instability. I argue that going through these experiences during crisis times, occurring during their politically impressionable years, have created enduring generational differences in EU attitudes. Formative life events such as becoming a parent or transitioning out of education, especially when coupled with financial insecurity, are expected to amplify more generalized crisis effects in terms of EU attitudes. Furthermore, young individuals who faced crisis-informed challenges during key transitions are expected to demand stronger EU involvement in policies addressing these domains. The expectations are tested using original survey data from 16 European countries, fielded in January 2025 through YouGov. The hypothesized generational effects are expected to differ across regions and by crisis, and moderated by individual perceptions of EU crisis management. The findings contribute to understanding how Europe’s crises have shaped this generation’s political outlook, with implications for the EU’s long-term legitimacy and policymaking.","Keywords: Political Socialization, Generations, Formative Life Events, EU Attitudes; Crisis Effects","Mathilde M. van Ditmars","Mathilde M. van Ditmars",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Milan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An Analysis of Spain's CIS Accuracy in Pre-Election Estimates Over Time","The rise of online polling has provided near real-time insights into voting intentions and likely electoral outcomes, making polls highly visible to political actors, the media, and the public. Research shows that polls can influence attitudes and voting behaviour, raising concerns about bias, especially when estimates deviate from election results or other pollsters.In Spain, the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS), a public institute regularly releasing pre-election estimates, has faced criticism for allegedly overestimating the vote share of ruling parties since 2018, when a new director with ties to the socialist party PSOE took over under the PSOE-Sumar government. We analyse CIS pre-election estimates from 2012 to 2024, a period marked by alternance in government and CIS's directorship, covering 69 regional and national elections, to assess time trends in CIS’s estimate accuracy. We specifically focus on estimates that exceed the margin of error. Our Bayesian change point analyses and regression discontinuity models show that, particularly since 2018, CIS has consistently overestimated the vote share of PSOE and its allies, though this does not involve underestimating the conservative PP, or its allies. A synthetic control analysis supports the causal nature of this relationship: using estimates from other Spanish pollsters, we construct a synthetic control to benchmark CIS’s estimation, revealing that no such systematic misestimation of specific parties occurs in this counterfactual scenario.This highlights how political control over polling institutions may affect the accuracy of election forecasts, raising questions about accountability and public trust in state-sponsored polling.","Keywords: election polls, public opinion, estimation accuracy, polls effects, Spanish politics","Klara Müller","Klara Müller","University of Mannheim","Alejandro Fernández-Roldán Díaz","National University of Distance Education and University Carlos III Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Mannheim","National University of Distance Education and University Carlos III Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article argues that democratic institutions cause regular turnover of democratic leaders, resulting in their average age remaining the same. Yet, why are dictators, on average, getting older and older? I examine three competing explanations for this pattern. First, 1) aging, namely that medical advances cause dictators to live longer than they would have done previously, 2) a decline in the likelihood of removal due to dictators adopting better strategies for remaining in power, and 3) that dictators are getting older when they first enter power. The results indicate that the two first reasons are the better explanations. At last, the article discusses the potential consequences of this pattern, using both theoretical arguments, matching, and difference-in-difference methods. Overall, the article shows that this is a worrying pattern with grave consequences, such as lower growth, more repression, and more international conflicts. It also argues that the strengthening of democratic institutions is necessary to circumvent this development.","Keywords: Age, dictators, democracy, institutions, economic growth","Jacob Nyrup","Jacob Nyrup",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oslo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If so, are there added returns to combining contact and empathy education? Does either approach unlock spillover effects among household members? To answer these questions, we conduct a field experiment that brings together Syrian refugees and Lebanese nationals in three localities in Lebanon, where refugees make up a quarter of the population. Working with a Lebanese NGO, we randomly assign Lebanese and Syrian youth participants to an ethnically heterogeneous or homogeneous classroom for a 12-week psycho-social support program. We further randomize whether participants received additional empathy education or a placebo curriculum focused on health and nutrition. We find that contact significantly reduces prejudicial attitudes toward the out-group --- but also depresses participation in future contact, such as attending events celebrating the outgroup's culture 1-2 months after treatment, and worsens mental health among refugee parents and youth.  By contrast, we find that empathy education is just as effective --- if not more so --- at reducing prejudicial attitudes, but without these backlash effects. We do not find clear interaction effects of contact and empathy training --- positive effects of the combined treatment are similar to those of empathy alone. The results point to empathy education as a cheaper, more scalable, and potentially even more effective strategy for building social cohesion than intergroup contact.","Keywords: Experimental research; Migration politics; Conflict, Violence and Security; Middle East Politics","Alexandra Scacco","Alexandra Scacco","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","Salma Mousa","UCLA","Lennard Naumann","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WZB Berlin Social Science Center","UCLA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been widely acknowledged that sexual violence is a distinct form of war-related violence with particularly detrimental effects beyond the crime itself. Sexual violence moreover constitutes a severe trust violation. Understanding the persistent effects of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) on social trust is therefore highly relevant in the context of post-war reconciliation. Our objective is to add to the ongoing debate in the literature how conflicts characterized by a process of ethnicization might differently shape ethnic in-group and out-group trust. Moreover, we want to shed light on how exposure to CRSV shapes trust in the same vs. the opposite sex. Although sexual violence targets a person's gendered identity like no other form of violence, sex has been largely neglected as marker for trustworthiness in previous literature. Original representative survey data (N=3,000) collected in Bosnia-Herzegovina from September--December 2024 allows us to systematically analyze our research question. To address issues of social desirability bias, we rely on a conjoint experiment that allows us to contrast the importance of ethnicity and sex in trust decisions.

Intergroup threat has been identified as a key antecedent, yet significant gaps remain regarding which types of threats elicit specific emotions and how these emotions contribute to prejudicial attitudes towards out-party supporters. This paper addresses these gaps by examining how different types of threat evoke fear and anger toward out-party supporters and how these emotions, in turn, shape partisan prejudice. Using data from an original 13-country cross-sectional survey, we find that realistic threats -concerns about resources, status, and security- are predominantly associated with fear, whereas symbolic threats -challenges to values, culture, and worldview- are more likely to elicit anger. Both fear and anger are positively associated with heightened prejudice toward out-party supporters, in line with our hypotheses. In a second step, we conduct a survey experiment to test whether manipulating fear and anger confirms these relationships, with results expected in spring 2025. This research highlights the crucial role of threat and related emotions in deepening polarized rifts and driving supporters of opposing parties further apart. In doing so, it provides critical insights for interventions aimed at mitigating polarized attitudes and fostering intergroup understanding.","Keywords: intergroup threat, emotions, affective polarization, partisan prejudice","Elena Heinz","Elena Heinz","University of Vienna","Ruthie Pliskin","Leiden University","Markus Wagner","University of Vienna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Vienna","Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Comparing government-opposition relations in parliamentary voting and speechmaking","Government-opposition relations are often measured using one of two parliamentary activities – legislative voting (e.g., Tuttnauer and Wegmann 2022), which is arguably the most important activity of legislatures (Saalfeld 1995) and speechmaking (e.g., Schwalbach 2022), which is among the most visible activity of members of parliament and a staple of representative democracy (Proksch and Slapin 2012). However, the extent to which the two activities align remains unclear. This paper will investigate whether government and opposition parties’ speech reflects their respective voting behaviour, relying on a uniquely broad dataset from 12 countries (Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, The United Kingdom, Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) representing different political, institutional, and cultural settings over roughly 20 years per country. Combining vote (such as congruence measures and roll-call vote scaling) and automated text analysis (such as sentiment analysis and stance detection), we identify the conditions under which parties’ policy-making activities (voting) and communication activities (speechmaking) align to reflect government-opposition relations similarly, and those under which they differ. This has a twofold contribution. Voting and speechmaking have complementary advantages in terms of research, as the former is simpler to analyse, but the latter is more publicly available. Knowing when the two activities align will enable researchers to choose cases based on selection criteria rather than data availability or analytical capabilities. When the two activities do not align, this may reflect strategic differential behaviour by parties, opening the door to more focused research on the explanations for such discrepancies.","Keywords: government, opposition, legislative voting, parliamentary speech, text analysis","Or Tuttnauer, Lukas Warode","Or Tuttnauer","University of Mannheim"," Lukas Warode","University of Mannheim","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Modern GOTV interventions, which are accompanied by rigorous testing using RCTs, are a textbook example of a promising, effective campaign innovation pioneered by Yale political scientists Donald Green and Alan Gerber in the late 1990s and then adapted and scaled up by academics, political parties, and political groups across the United States, and later across the globe. In this paper, we describe how randomised GOTV interventions spread across time and space. We test how the switch from non-partisan interventions conducted by academics to partisan interventions conducted by political campaigns, in tandem with data privacy restrictions in some states and countries but not in others, condition the effectiveness of GOTV interventions. Partisan interventions are less effective in places that make it harder for campaigns to identify supporters. We also show that political campaigns struggle to meet contact rates set as benchmarks by academics, especially in places where contacting supporters is harder. This decline in effectiveness is accompanied by constant innovation relating to the content of the intervention, which appears to counter some of the decline in effectiveness. Our meta-analysis is based on a comprehensive new dataset of approximately 400 GOTV interventions conducted across the globe between 1998 and 2024.","Keywords: RCT, scaling-up, GOTV, meta-analysis","Florian Foos","Florian Foos","London School of Economics and Political Science","Peter C.

Yet, the evidence regarding the effect of partisanship on local redistribution in developing countries is mixed. In this paper, I explore the impact of Bolivian mayors representing Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), headed by Evo Morales as president of Bolivia from 2006 to 2019. I test whether municipalities with MAS-affiliated mayors exhibit higher reductions in inequality and poverty than municipalities with opposition mayors. I anticipate that MAS mayors fulfil voters’ demands for redistributive policies in congruence with the party’s ideology and thereby achieve higher reductions in inequality during their governing period than the opposition, and I explore corruption as a potential intervening mechanism. The analysis relies on administrative data and satellite nighttime light data as proxies for economic development and inequality. I use a close election regression discontinuity design for three municipal elections in Bolivia (2004, 2010, and 2015). Contrary to my expectation, I find that MAS-led municipalities show significant increases in inequality. Yet, in municipalities with higher irregularities, poverty reduced significantly.

"abstract_1260_1843_0680.html","Correcting Misperceptions: The Impact of Coalition Performance Information on Citizen Attitudes and Voting Behavior","Previous research has indicated that (perceived) government performance significantly influences citizens' voting behavior. However, when evaluating coalition governments, citizens often underestimate coalition pledge fulfillment, perceiving it more negatively than scientific findings suggest. This misperception becomes problematic when electoral decisions are based on these biased or inaccurate information. Addressing this issue, our study examines whether providing citizens with scientific information about actual coalition pledge fulfillment impacts their political attitudes and voting intentions. We hypothesize that correcting these misperceptions increases political trust and the likelihood of voting for incumbent parties while reducing populist attitudes and support for populist parties. Moreover, we anticipate that when misperceptions are addressed, citizens exhibit greater tolerance for non-fulfilled pledges. To test these hypotheses, we examine the case of Germany's ""Traffic Light Coalition"" (2021–2025), which, despite an effective track record documented by scientific studies, struggled with a poor public image and collapsed before the regular end of term. Using a vignette experiment with graphic information conducted shortly before and after the upcoming elections in February, we assess how exposure to factual information about coalition performance influences voter behavior and perceptions. The findings of this study underscore the critical role of information in fostering informed electoral decisions, particularly in an era increasingly characterized by misinformation and the growing appeal of populist and extremist narratives.","Keywords: information; government performance; voting; experiment","Theres Matthieß","Theres Matthieß","University of Göttingen","Heike Klüver","Humboldt University of Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Göttingen","Humboldt University of Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1261_1615_0684.html","Inheriting the Vote: Successor Bias and the Incumbency Advantage in Proportional Electoral Systems","We investigate the incumbency advantage in proportional representation (PR) systems, focusing on the special case of successor incumbents — candidates who assume office midterm when incumbents vacate their seats. Leveraging a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and a novel measure of electoral closeness, we provide empirical evidence from Swiss cantonal elections, analyzing over 196,000 candidate records from 23 cantons since the 1950s. Our findings reveal a significant incumbency advantage: elected incumbents have a 44-percentage-point higher probability of reelection, which increases to 55 percentage points for successors. However, this difference primarily reflects the higher participation rates among successors. By distinguishing between elected and successor incumbents, we identify a “successor bias” in traditional incumbency estimates, suggesting that successor entry skews standard RDD-based measurements of incumbency effects unconditional on participation. These insights contribute to a refined understanding of incumbency dynamics in open-list PR systems and underscore the importance of accounting for successors in electoral advantage studies.","Keywords: Regression Discontinuity Design, Proportional Representation, Incumbency Advantage, Voting Behaviour","Jana Jarck","Jana Jarck","University of Lucerne","Lukas Schmid","University of Lucerne","Mark Schelker","University of Fribourg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Lucerne","University of Fribourg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Case of Democratic and Republican Endorsements of Fossil Fuel Pipelines","Do people oppose policies supported by the other party as much as they support policies supported by their own?  In two preregistered information experiments, samples of US residents were presented with messages that Donald Trump and Joe Biden (Kamala Harris in experiment 2) support or oppose the Mountain Valley Natural Gas Pipeline. All respondents read messages from both parties.  Respondents were randomly assigned to reading that both Biden and Trump support the pipeline, both oppose the pipeline, Trump supports and Biden (or Harris) opposes, or Trump opposes and Biden (or Harris) supports.  The experiment tests whether respondents' support for the pipeline is lower when the outparty supports the pipeline, conditional on their inparty either supporting or opposing the pipeline.  The results from experiment 1 show that the message from the out party has no effect on partisans' support for the pipeline.  Only inparty messages affect partisan support for the pipeline.   Self-identified independents show greater approval of the pipeline when both parties endorse it.  The results confirm that partisans do not value bipartisan messages, nor does negative partisanship affect public attitudes toward the pipeline.  The paper will further test whether support from Biden or Harris has greater effect on public opinion toward the pipeline and whether support from Trump in September 2023 or September 2024 has a greater effect on public opinion toward the pipeline.","Keywords: political parties, partisanship, US politics, elite endorsements, public opinion, energy, environment, pipelines","Dean Lacy","Dean Lacy",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Dartmouth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Additionally, we investigate the democratic consequences of these party system trajectories by exploring what types of party systems are most conducive to various aspects of democratic performance.

Geopolitics and the Choice of Trade Measures","How does geopolitical affinity influence the trade measures that countries impose on one another? We argue that greater geopolitical distance is associated with an increased likelihood of a country enacting measures that negatively discriminate against commercial entities from the other country. This pattern should be particularly pronounced when the imposing country has a competitive disadvantage in the production of a good or the provision of a service.To test this argument, we leverage data from the Global Trade Alert dataset, which comprises over 70,000 trade measures implemented globally since 2008, along with information on the countries affected by each measure. The dependent variable in the analysis is the number of discriminatory trade measures that country A imposes on country B within a sector during year t. The key predictor is the distance in ideal points between countries derived from voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly. To test the role of competitive disadvantage, we moderate this variable with a measure of revealed comparative advantage at the sectoral level.Preliminary findings support the hypotheses, indicating that geopolitical affinity plays a significant role in shaping trade policy.

"abstract_1266_1988_1046.html","A panel approach to gender differences in left-right self-placement amongst young people (GENPOL)","Recent evidence suggests growing ideological differences between young men and women, with two key trends emerging since 2018. Young women increasingly align with progressive positions, whether on the liberal-conservative spectrum in the U.S. or the left-right divide in Western Europe. In some cases, this shift moves them toward more leftist stances; in others, their preferences remain stable. In contrast, young men are trending toward right-wing positions, with a notable shift to the right in the past five years, widening the ideological gap.This paper investigates why this divergence is occurring. We propose three interrelated explanations. First, the implementation of feminist policies promoting gender equality may have triggered a backlash among young men, fostering feelings of alienation and mistrust toward parties championing these policies. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions heightened young men’s sense of insecurity and mistrust in public institutions. Third, social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok have fragmented public discourse while amplifying radical content. Unfiltered by traditional gatekeepers, these platforms allow young men to encounter and engage with ideologically extreme messages.Using original survey data from the GENPOL project, this study evaluates these explanations and examines the underlying drivers of young men’s growing distance from feminism and gender equality policies. By addressing this ideological polarization, the paper contributes to understanding the political implications of these trends and their broader impact on democratic systems.","Keywords: left-right self-placement, gender, youth, gender gap","Javier Lorente","Javier Lorente","Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"," Irene Sánchez-Vítores","Universidad Rey Juan Carlos","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Rey Juan Carlos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1267_1740_1212.html","Foreign influencer operations: How TikTok shapes American perceptions of China","Authoritarian regimes attempt to shape global public opinion towards non-democratic political systems using foreign influence operations. Influence operations conducted through state media organs such as Russia Today (RT) or China Global Television News (CGTN) have built significant online presences. Yet in recent years, regimes have turned to outsourcing content creation to ""influencers"" not explicitly tied to the regime. These influencers produce “clickbait” content that seeks to entertain. Whether this content is government-sponsored propaganda is unclear. Some influencers have direct financial and other ties to the regime; others have no ties but produce content that matches the goals of official state media organs. We collect descriptive data on viral pro-China content appearing on TikTok. First, we identify the most prevalent creators of pro-China content, analyze the main themes used by pro-China influencers, and estimate the revenue they earn from producing this content. Next, we examine whether content created by pro-China influencers on TikTok shapes Americans' attitudes towards China and the Chinese political system by conducting an experiment on a large sample of Americans exposing them to a simulated version of TikTok. We hypothesize that pro-China influencers will be effective at building public acceptance of China's authoritarian political system and global leadership. We also hypothesize that viewers will be more willing to consume this media than official state media, but that influencer produced content will have weaker effects on attitudes and behavior than state media. We test two channels for how influencer propaganda shapes public opinion: source credibility and emotional resonance.","Keywords: Experiment; social media, authoritarianism, influence operations, propaganda","Trevor Incerti","Trevor Incerti","University of Amsterdam","Daniel Mattingly","Yale University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Amsterdam","Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1268_2494_1265.html","Public Support for Discriminatory Fiscal Policies","Research has consistently shown that many voters who disagree with fiscal austerity turn towards non-mainstream, often radical right parties after governments adjusts fiscal policy. While these studies convincingly establish an empirical association between austerity and an increase in the vote share of radical parties, the underlying mechanisms that lead to these findings remained untested. This paper aims to answer this question by examining how fiscal policy decisions, specifically cuts in spending (austerity), influence the support for policies that are in line with the policy stances of radical right populist parties. In line with the “us-versus-them”-narrative frequently used by the populist radical right, we assess how a context of austerity, makes citizens more discriminatory, by supporting policies that distribute public finances disproportionally towards people like themselves (natives) as opposed to foreigners. Leveraging original data from survey experiments fielded in France, Germany, and the UK, we find that the prospect of austerity and tighter fiscal space, on average, lead respondents to take more exclusionary, discriminatory stances. Looking at subgroups heterogeneity, we find that the support of discriminatory fiscal policies is particularly high among people who position themselves on the very right of the political spectrum. Our paper thus explains the rising support of the radical right by combining people’s preferences on the economic dimension of political competition with the people’s attitudes and preferences on the cultural dimension.","Keywords: Austerity, populist radical right, fiscal policy, survey experiment, political parties","Evelyne Hübscher","Evelyne Hübscher","Central European University, DPP","Thomas Sattler","University of Geneva","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Central European University, DPP","University of Geneva",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1269_1269_1325.html","Towards a Responsibility Gap? A Survey-based Investigation of Responsibility Ascription among Representatives and Represented","The representative model of democracy rests on the principle of representatives acting in the interest of the represented. Elected with the mandate to act on behalf of their constituents, representatives are expected to take responsibility for acting for and supporting public purposes. As Pitkin states, “the representative must be the one who acts.” However, this imperative is arguably under transition. Scholars point to a development of ‘responsibilisation’ where the duty to act is transferred to autonomous, non-elected actors, including individual citizens, corporations, and civil society groups, expected to tackle societal issues, such as environmental degradation and poverty. With this, new responsibility structures emerge, raising important questions to the representative relationship and representative democracy writ large. New responsibility arrangements might result in a “gap” between representatives and represented in terms of how, and to whom responsibility is ascribed. Such a gap may in turn alter the very nexus grounding the authority of representative democracy – the relationship between representatives and represented. Focusing on the examples of three societal issues, the climate crisis, declining school results, and poverty, this quantitative study contributes to the representation literature by investigating what actors in society are ascribed the most responsibility for tackling these issues, and by exploring whether there is a gap in how responsibility is ascribed among representatives and represented. Data is collected through citizen panels and politician panels in Sweden, Norway, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg as part the POLPOP-project, based in Antwerp, Belgium.","Keywords: Representative democracy, responsibility, responsibilisation","Elin Alfredsson Malmros","Elin Alfredsson Malmros",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Political Science, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The transition into the labour market may slow down the development of political interest due to heightened cognitive demands and reduced availability of mental resources for reflective and intellectually demanding activities, such as political engagement. This paper investigates how entering the labour market affects the trajectory of political interest among young individuals in the United Kingdom. Using panel data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and employing matching techniques and difference-in-differences analysis, the study isolates the impact of labour market entry from socioeconomic background effects. Results suggest that the mental exhaustion associated with work, compared to activities such as studying, slows the development of political interest, highlighting the cognitive trade-offs of workforce participation.

Previous studies on these consequences are limited in the topics they consider, and they are largely reliant on cross-sectional observational approaches which cannot identify causal relationships. One such overlooked topic is whether political distrust undermines support for democratic norms. While it has often been argued that political distrust threatens democratic legitimacy, previous work on support for democratic norms focuses instead on democratic discounting. In this paper, I conduct the first experimental test of how political distrust may reduce support for democratic norms in three ways: by prompting direct support for authoritarian values; by increasing intolerance for partisan out-groups; and by increasing support for antidemocratic behavior by partisan in-groups. In so doing, I provide the first causally rigorous test of whether we should be concerned about political distrust threatening democratic legitimacy.","Keywords: Political trust, democratic norms, undemocratic behavior, tolerance, survey experiment.","Edmund Kelly","Edmund Kelly",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We implemented this experiment in the fall of 2024, with a sample of 2200 subjects across 144 Senegalese communities, about half of whom were randomly selected to receive detailed information about legal requirements and application procedures for the lottery-based U.S. Diversity Visa Program.

We assess the impact of this intervention on expressed migration aspirations, and ask whether it heightened educational and training aspirations for participants and their children. We also test an argument frequently brought up in policy debates, namely that opening up legal migration channels should weaken the demand for irregular migration. This does not appear to hold in our case. In fact, the lottery information broadly increases international migration aspirations, which are in turn a primary determinant of irregular migration intent.","Keywords: West Africa, international migration, information provision, human capital","Bernd Beber","Bernd Beber",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1273_1155_1554.html","The Effects of Language Policy Changes in Regions of Ethnic Autonomy","What is the effect of changes to official language policies in autonomous regions? Regional autonomy provides opportunities for unique policies that protect ethnic and cultural differences and promote the use of languages distinct from the national rules. Yet, autonomous regions are not fully independent from the central governments; linguistic integration can provide opportunities, and regional populations can be diverse. The need to balance the preservation of identity practices sometimes conflicts with the need to learn and use the national official language or lingua franca. Once adopted, policies related to language are typically sticky – changing policies can be politically fraught and logistically challenging. We explore the effects of language policy changes on educational attainment and economic integration in the 40% of autonomous regions have changed their official language or language of education since 1991. We use panel data regressions to investigate factors driving changes and assess whether the rates of educational attainment and economic patterns change compared to autonomous regions without policy changes and comparable non-autonomous regions. We argue that autonomous regions primarily change their official language and language of education in response to factors external to the region, specifically, when migration patterns shift, when economic inequality across regions grows, and when the country context becomes less democratic. We find delayed effects on education and the economy, but the changes are nuanced and depend on the specific combination of language policies. The results highlight the challenges of balancing language identity and economic growth and educational opportunities in autonomous regions.","Keywords: language policy; autonomy; ethnic politics; education policy","Elise Pizzi","Elise Pizzi","University of Iowa"," Haofeng Ma","University of Iowa"," Alex Bezahler","University of Iowa","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Iowa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1274_2689_0383.html","Explaining the persistent exclusion of women and gender from post-conflict peacebuidling","This research begins by addressing a critical paradox: twenty-five years after the ratification of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, the track record of gender inclusivity in peacebuilding remains dismal. Moreover, the overall effectiveness of peacebuilding itself has been disappointing.  Existing literature suggests a strong link between these two phenomena: the exclusion of women correlates with more fragile peace agreements that are prone to relapse. Despite robust evidence that the inclusion of women leads to more resilient peace processes and the reinforcement of international norms advocating for gender inclusivity, women and their interests continue to be marginalized in post-conflict peacebuilding.   For the study, I  create and utilize an enhanced version of the PA-X Peace Agreement Database for large-N analysis, alongside a qualitative case study of Afghanistan—including archival research, semi-structured surveys with policymakers, and process tracing of its peace process—my research demonstrates that certain actors are more inclined to advocate for the inclusion of women and gender provisions, while others obstruct these efforts.

Whilst plenty of research has been done on political communication in the virtual environment, which found that political conversation in the virtual environment tends to be more confrontational and less able to make an impression on counterparties, virtual parliament provides a unique opportunity to study how the virtual and physical speech interact with each other under the same context. Using Hansard record of the House of Commons during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by looking at the lexicon similarity between speeches to infer influence, this paper will analyse whether MPs' speeches made via teleconferencing during hybrid proceedings are indeed less influential in the subsequent debate than their colleague who deliver speeches in person. The result find that virtual speeches are more influential than the average physical speech, but this is reverse when MP fixed-effect was included, which suggest a self-selection process where more influential MPs choose to participate virtually might be driving the result.

Building on a grassroots movement that organized unofficial municipal referendums (2009–2011), the ANC played a pivotal role in Catalonia’s push for independence.This paper examines the ANC’s unique structure and capacity to mobilize support to influence election outcomes. To this goal, I first assess the factors behind the branches’ expansion and find that in the early phases, mobilization leveraged existing resources, including the grassroots movement behind the Consultes. The creation of new branches also concentrated in municipalities where pro-independence parties, especially small ones, had previously gained voter support. This highlights the ANC’s ability to channel existing pro-independence sentiment. While the complementary logic lost traction after 2012, the mobilization of existing resources remained important, and new branches emerged in municipalities with larger election turnouts.Second, I estimate the ANC’s impact on pro-independence voting using Callaway and Sant’Anna’s (2021) difference-in-difference identification strategy. Municipalities that created branches early in the game saw 2–4 percentage point increases in support for pro-independence parties in key regional elections, though this effect diminished over time. The mobilization also influenced participation at the individual level, increasing attendance at key rallies in Barcelona.This study bridges research on the dynamics of secession movements and protests, providing novel insights into how localized mobilization can shape electoral outcomes, stressing the importance of structured grassroots social movements.","Keywords: Secession, Social Movement Organization, Protest Outcomes, Voting","Maria Jose Hierro","Maria Jose Hierro",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Yale University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1277_2592_0276.html","Equality positions and policies of governments in 12 OECD countries","Redistributive rhetoric is prevalent in politics and campaigns. But do parties deliver equality-enhancing policies once in office? We argue that parties are in general policy seeking, but then opt only for the equality-enhancing policies that inflict less concentrated costs on their voters and on themselves. Factoring in the credit-taking opportunities and risk aversion in light of the varying socio-economic profiles of parties’ electorates, we expect that even egalitarians only selectively pursue equality policies. We test if the extent to which parties emphasize economic equality results in three pathways to (in)equality. We analyse the effect of parties on 1) fiscal redistribution, 2) pre-distribution, and 3) welfare state policies in 12 countries, 1970-2020. Using new data on positions on economic equality obtained through crowd-coding of 850,000 statements, we link data on parties’ equality positions with data on voters, coalitions, and policy choices. We show that the promise of equality (often) remains unfulfilled. Egalitarian parties pursue welfare state compensation (for the middle class) and pre-distribution via minimum wages (for the poor) – but even they rarely pursue fiscal redistribution (from the rich). The reason, we argue, is that even egalitarians choose the policy path of least electoral resistance. The gap between position and policy is thus more pronounced if reforms would inflict concentrated costs on powerful groups, if the electorate is particularly affluent or educated, and when left and right parties find themselves in ""mixed"" coalitions.","Keywords: inequality, party positions, voters, policy, redistribution","Alexander Horn","Alexander Horn","University of Konstanz"," Leo Ahrens","University of Konstanz","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Konstanz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this project, we first illustrate the magnitude of missing data problems in the study of party brands, then we show how missingness varies systematically across demographic groups and political variables. We use the Party Brands Dataset – a massive corpus containing all available data on voters’ perceptions of parties’ positions in advanced democracies – to reveal how voters’ refusal to place parties induces non-response bias that fundamentally changes inferences on topics related to party brands, accuracy of placements, and perceived proximity to parties. We then demonstrate how a simple solute involving multiple imputation can help correct these inferential problems.","Keywords: Voter knowledge, voters' perceptions, parties' positions","Laron Williams, David Fortunato, Thiago Silva","Laron Williams","University of Missouri","Rylie Wieseler","University of Missouri","David Fortunato","University of California - San Diego","Thiago Silva","Australian National University","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Missouri","University of California - San Diego","Australian National University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effect exists irrespective of the specific considered issue, albeit it is significantly weaker in the case of economic redistribution.

This paper examines the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war on the European Union’s (EU) internal cohesion and governance in boundary changes. Building on the competence-control (CC) framework, we argue that this perceived attack to the EU’s interests triggers policy shifts across security, migration, and sanctions enforcement, reshaping the balance between intergovernmental cooperation and supranational authority.

This context led to the development of different, even opposed, political narratives employed simultaneously by multiple sides of the political spectrum. The paper explores the evolution of narratives about ""the West"" in political elite discourse over the last 30 years, as illustrated in their party electoral programmes. Using an interpretative approach and computational text analysis methods, I identify four main meanings: ""something they aspire to"", ""something they are part of"", ""something they are not fully part of"", and ""something they consider a threat"". This inductive categorization is then extended using a supervised topic model (BERT-NLI) to over 17 thousand sentences that contain references to ""the West"", Western countries or international organizations in 291 party manifestos from 10 Central and Eastern European countries.

"abstract_1283_1840_0912.html","Bullying buddy: How formal and informal allies withstand U.S. sanction pressure","The literature on economic sanctions suggests that powerful senders can “weaponize” asymmetries in networks of interdependence to coerce opposing states and reluctant allies into significant concessions. This article qualifies this assertion and conceives of economic sanctions in line with critiques of the pioneering contributions on “complex interdependence” as an implicit bargaining process in which the bargaining leverage of the sender and the target influences the onset and success of coercive measures. Differentiating between the relative power of formal and informal allies and other sanction targets, we expect that formal allies fall less frequently victim to sanctions than informal partners and non-allied states. The model suggests further that the sanctioner needs stronger measures against informal partners unless they are economically more powerful and less dependent on the sender. Powerful alliance partners have to grant more concessions than non-allied partners. The empirical analysis, which focuses on the sanctioning behavior of the U.S., the most prolific sender in the post-Cold War era, supports our conjectures.

"abstract_1284_2159_1049.html","Gendered political participation - Which action do you prefer? (GENPOL)","Once incorporated into public life, women appear to prefer modes of political participation that differ from those preferred by men. Evidence suggests that women are more attracted to local politics, private activism, and voting; they also prefer inclusive institutions and small groups. Meanwhile, men are relatively more involved in collective actions and political parties. Previous studies have suggested several reasons but have not attempted to isolate which characteristics make some forms of action more attractive. Is it the time required to participate, the organizers, the level of government addressed, the existence of conflict, or the privacy of the action that makes the difference? To understand gendered preferences in forms of political action, we employed a choice-based conjoint experimental design where respondents were asked to make a forced choice between two hypothetical forms of action to react to a political decision they disagree with. The survey experiment was embedded in a large sample of the Spanish population in July 2023.

"abstract_1285_1949_1213.html","Transnational Impact of Chinese Propaganda on Intergroup Relations Overseas","China frequently disseminates its propaganda beyond its national borders, targeting individuals of Chinese descent to build a narrative of a larger Chinese nation led by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Given that there are over 40 million overseas Chinese -- one of the largest diaspora groups globally -- the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a significant pool of potential adherents who may be susceptible to its messages. Despite growing concerns about the transnational impact of Chinese propaganda, there is a notable lack of research examining this issue from an intergroup perspective. This gap is particularly striking given anecdotal evidence of clear ethnic divides in sentiments towards China between Chinese and non-Chinese communities abroad. Observers and policymakers have highlighted the potentially destabilizing effects of Chinese propaganda and disinformation in countries with large Chinese diaspora communities, though definitive evidence supporting these observations is lacking. Drawing on social identity theory, we argue that exposure to PRC propaganda heightens ethnic divisions and grievances, thereby increasing outgroup prejudice among both Chinese and non-Chinese populations. To test this, we conduct a survey experiment examining the transnational effects of Chinese propaganda on interethnic relations in Malaysia, with preliminary pilot surveys supporting our concerns about its destabilizing effects. This research demonstrates how foreign propaganda can destabilize domestic intergroup relations, offering crucial insights into the intersection between international political communication and social cohesion in multiethnic countries.","Keywords: propaganda, Southeast Asia, intergroup relations, political communication","Jeremy Siow","Jeremy Siow","University of Oxford","Minh Trinh","Purdue University","Tony Yang","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Oxford","Purdue University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the case of Norway, where the development of renewable energy infrastructures such as wind farms has met increased public opposition, this paper investigates political representation by examining opinion congruence between citizens and political representatives on the trade-off between preserving local nature and mitigating global climate change. Our findings suggest clear urban-rural divides in citizens' preferences, with rural citizens showing stronger preferences for local nature preservation. Drawing on survey data from the Norwegian Citizens Panel and the Norwegian Panel of Elected Representatives, we study how citizens' preferences align with those of their representatives across different groups and contexts, thus contributing to the understanding of environmental representation and the challenges of implementing climate policies.","Keywords: political representation, issue-congruence, climate, nature, trade-off","Marte S.

Drawing on social survey data from 1995 to 2023 across 21 backsliding countries, I apply various attitudinal development theories to argue that backsliding during the formative years shapes democratic support later in life. I posit that, during these formative years, the effects of backsliding on democratic support is contingent upon (i) regime performance (economic or political) and (ii) individual status within the backsliding regime. By comparing age cohorts in backsliding democracies, I explore how those socialized during their formative years in a democracy differ from those in a backsliding regime. I hypothesize that positive regime performance during formative years in a democracy enhances democratic support, while similar experiences in a backsliding regime reduce democratic support. Conversely, I propose that negative regime experiences lead to increased democratic support for individuals socialized under a backsliding regime, compared to those raised in a democratic regime. Finally, I hypothesize that being a regime loser under backsliding amplifies support for democracy, suggesting the role of nostalgia for the previous regime.","Keywords: political socialization; democratic backsliding; early-adulthood regime experiences; political behavior; political learning","Gina Aniano","Gina Aniano",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To explain this shift, we analyze the role of Norwegian UNIFIL soldiers returning from Lebanon from 1978 onward. Combining panel data from opinion surveys and soldier records, we exploit regional variation in soldiers' return locations to show how their first-hand accounts from the frontlines influenced political attitudes in their local communities.

Using original surveillance records from the archives of the Imperial Russian Secret Police (Okhrana), we construct local radicalization indicators and categorize anti-Tsarist crimes into revolutionary activities (propaganda and membership) and political violence (organization of riots and assassinations). To compute the impact of terrorism on political attitudes, we link these data to the results of the 1917 Constituent Assembly elections in over 400 districts, widely considered to be the last free elections before the 1990s. We account for inter-district revolutionary spillovers by using spatial analysis and considering various factors in Russia's political evolution. Within the Pale of Settlement, political violence led to a shift in voting preferences in favor of centrist parties, while revolutionary activities strengthened conservative factions. This suggests that Russian society in the early 20th century favored stability and gradual reform over radical leftist proposals. Our findings challenge the conventional narrative of the tsarist bureaucracy as inefficient and underscore the role of the Pale of Settlement in the partial radicalization of political preferences. Furthermore, we emphasize the crucial function of secret police in maintaining authoritarian survival.","Keywords: Russian Empire, Historical Political Economy, Europe, Secret Police, Surveillance, Revolutionaries, Voting","Julia Zimmermann","Julia Zimmermann","Trinity College Dublin","Theocharis Grigoriadis","Freie Universität Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Trinity College Dublin","Freie Universität Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1290_2091_0527.html","The Efficiency–Deliberation Trade–Off of Crisis Politics: Evidence from Parliamentary Legislative Activity in Germany and Austria","Over the past decade, democracies in Europe and beyond have faced several crises, creating a complex tapestry of challenges demanding rapid yet deliberative policy responses. This paper investigates how parliamentary legislative activity adapts to crises characterized by high uncertainty and urgency. We argue that legislators face trade-offs between legislative efficiency and deliberative quality (Hoppe, 2011; Parkinson, 2018), and that these trade-offs evolve strategically throughout crises. Conceptualizing crises along two key dimensions — intensity and duration — we hypothesize that these dimensions moderate legislators’ trade-off considerations. Specifically, early stages of a crisis favor swift and efficient responses, whereas later stages facilitate a shift toward more deliberative processes as urgency subsides and policy scrutiny increases. We test these claims using the ParlLawSpeech corpus, which links 190,000 parliamentary speeches with 14,000 legislative proposals and 11,000 adopted laws in Germany (2009–2021) and 200,000 speeches with 6,000 proposals and 3,000 laws in Austria (1996–2020). The prevalence of crises is estimated through domain-specific shifts in emergency emphasis within parliamentary debates, employing a latent semantic scaling model (Rauh, 2022). We analyze how these shifts influence legislative activity, focusing on the duration of legislative processes (indicating efficiency), the deliberative quality of debates (Behrendt et al., 2024) and the extent to which bills are amended before becoming laws (indicating deliberation). Our findings will offer important insights into how crises shape legislative behavior, highlighting the conditions under which efficiency is prioritized over deliberation, and illustrating the dynamic nature of crisis governance in national parliamentary settings.","Keywords: Emergency Politics, Legislative Efficiency, Deliberative Quality, Crisis Governance, Parliamentary Debates","Alexa Lenz","Lukas Hetzer","University of Cologne","Alexa Lenz","LMU Munich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Cologne","LMU Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Graduate status divides British voters on issues (such as immigration) and has led to the emergence of new parties (Reform UK) and the transformation of existing ones (Sobolewska and Ford, 2020). Some argue that it represents a new cleavage across Western Europe (Ford and Jennings, 2020). Extrapolating from the Danish case (Stubager, 2010), we ask if these substantial political differences have resulted in a new social identity, where graduates and non-graduates perceive each other to have opposing interests and to represent an ‘outgroup’. We use a new representative survey of the British public, including survey experiments, to develop a measure of education-based social identity among British voters. Next, we examine the political effects of this identity, finding that it motivates political attitudes, vote choice and candidate preference. On this basis, we argue that the education divide will continue to restructure party competition.","Keywords: educational polarisation, higher education, cleavage politics, social identity, Great Britain","Ralph Scott","Ralph Scott","University of Bristol","Hannah Bunting","University of Exeter","Robert Ford","University of Manchester","Maria Sobolewska","University of Manchester","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bristol","University of Exeter","University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1293_2552_0778.html","Exploiting Emergencies? How Emergency Politics Drives EU Authority Expansion","The successive and overlapping crises faced by the EU over the last years have led researchers to identify a new modus operandi in EU policymaking, that of emergency politics (Kreuder-Sonnen & White, 2022) or crisisification (Rhinard, 2019). A central argument in this literature is that crises are exploited to expand EU authority. However, we lack comprehensive empirical evidence testing whether crisis narratives enable EU authority expansion and whether this can be attributed to an exploitation of crisis narratives. This study is the first to test these claims over the span of 5 legislative periods using data from the ParlLawSpeech dataset, which links 6,900 bills, 6,600 laws, and 590,000 transcribed and Google-translated speeches from the European Parliament (1999-2024). First, I estimate emergency emphasis in speeches through a latent semantic scaling model (Rauh, 2022) and a newly constructed transformer model. I furthermore disentangle crisis exploitation from crisis management byexploiting emergency emphasis variations between Eurosceptic and Europhile speakers. Next, I analyze the extent to which EU authority expansion, measured through law texts (Yordanova et al., 2024), is associated with parliamentary emergency narratives and how context-specific factors affect this relationship. Preliminary results show that increased emergency emphasis in parliamentary debates generally increases the extent to which laws expand EU authority, especially in policy areas in which the EU has little competence. My findings will shed light on how emergency narratives are related to EU authority expansion, highlighting the conditions under which crisis politics leads to genuine governance needs versus strategic exploitation of crises.","Keywords: Emergency Politics, EU Authority Expansion, Crises, Legislative Behaviour, Parliamentary Debates","Lukas Hetzer","Lukas Hetzer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Cologne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1294_1272_0843.html","The Paradox of Representation:  How party system restructuring has changed representational inequality","Political congruence—the alignment between political actors and voters—is often considered biased in favor of wealthy and educated voters. Privileged groups are thought to wield greater influence over party and representative positions through mechanisms such as wealth and imbalances in descriptive representation. We challenge this conventional wisdom on both conceptual and theoretical grounds. Conceptually, we posit that previous findings of bias toward the wealthy and educated arose from examining the effects of income and education separately, thereby overlooking critical heterogeneity. Theoretically, we argue that parties positioning is driven by electoral competition dynamics and is independent of the influence of privileged voters. Parties position themselves to maximize votes. This is exemplified by party systems adjustments in response to the rising importance of cultural issues in the 1970s and 80s. We expect that before the transformation privileged and less privileged voters did not differ in their congruence levels. After the transformation, not privileged but voters with a low-income and longer education as well as voters with a high-income and shorter education should be most congruent. Empirically, we test our argument with a unique dataset covering five decades, 71 elections in total from 6 different countries. We find our expectations supported. Patterns of political congruence change over time and the most privileged are not the most congruent group.","Keywords: Representational inequality, party politics","Mario Bauriegel","Mario Bauriegel","Aarhus University","Carsten Jensen","Aarhus University","David Weisstanner","University of Lucerne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aarhus University","University of Lucerne",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the resource curse offers a partial explanation, we propose a broader framework: the appropriation curse. This theory posits that appropriable wealth, such as natural resources or agrarian commodities tied to territory, can be taken by force. Such wealth incentivizes violence and fosters autocratic institutions designed to extract and exclude. States with a higher share of appropriable wealth can maintain control and extract resources without granting rights, weakening the link between economic development, democracy, and human rights. We test this theory using a new measure of land rents as a proxy for appropriable wealth.

MOTHERHOOD, FATHERHOOD AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION: ANALYSIS OF MOTHERS' AND FATHERS' EVALUATIONS TOWARDS WOMEN POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES","The underrepresentation of women in political positions continues to be a reality, despite having the formal right to access it guaranteed for decades. One of the phenomena that could influence inequalities between men and women in the field of politics is gender roles. According to Royo Prieto (2011), the arrival of children into families is a moment in which gender dynamics are traditionalized, reinforcing and reproducing roles and stereotypes. In this sense, the question this research revolves around is the following: What impact do motherhood and fatherhood have on the evaluations of political representatives?Based on the previously stated research question, three central concepts are established: motherhood, paternity, and descriptive representation. The first two are closely related, but they are two separate phenomena that give rise to differentiated roles within families, shaping the lives of women and men differently. The third is based on the idea that the presence of women in political positions is a form of political representation in itself, and in the present research, it provides the framework to understand how evaluations of this descriptive representation of women vary between women and men with and without children:H1. Men rate women's political skills lower than women do.H2. Motherhood implies a lower rating of women's political skills.H3. Fatherhood does not imply significant differences in the rating of women's political skills.Royo Prieto, R. (2011).

"abstract_1297_1178_1537.html","Can Dobbs Change Minds on Abortion? Experimental Evidence on Perceived Public Opinion and Personal Opinion on Abortion in Post-Roe US","Anti-abortion activists have frequently claimed that restricting abortion access can shape public opinion and promote “cultural change” (e.g., Oberman, 2018). This concept is connected to the debate on whether institutional decisions influence people’s opinions. The theory of the expressive power of the law posits that laws signal societal values, potentially changing beliefs and behaviors (Sunstein, 1996). For laws to be expressive, they must be publicized, understood, and perceived as legitimate (McAdams, 2015). Judicial decisions can similarly shape personal attitudes (Dahl, 1957). While there is substantial research on rights-expanding rulings, less is known about rights-restricting decisions that oppose prevailing public opinion.To explore this, I conducted a survey experiment with 1,536 US adults representative of the US population on key demographics. Participants were asked about perceived public opinion and personal attitudes on abortion rights. The treated group read an excerpt about the Dobbs decision (i.e., the Supreme Court decision removing abortion from the US Constitution) before responding. Data on demographics, ideology, and trust in the Supreme Court were also collected (following Tankard & Paluck, 2017).Results showed no significant effect of being primed with information about Dobbs on perceived public opinion or personal attitudes, challenging claims of anti-abortion expressive power but also quasi-experimental evidence pointing towards backlash reactions (Clark et al., 2023). The perceived representativeness of the Supreme Court moderated the treatment effect, while previous knowledge of the decision did not.This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of institutional decisions on public opinion by providing experimental evidence.","Keywords: Institutional influences, social perception, abortion","Giulia Fornaro","Giulia Fornaro",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bocconi University, Department of Social and Political Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1298_1725_1439.html","Mechanisms of party identity socialisation within the family: evidence from Britain","This paper identifies the mechanisms of early party identity socialisation within the family. Although the question of why individuals harbour a given set of political attitudes is central in political behaviour research, the process of early political socialisation has often been treated as a “black box” (Aggeborn and Nyman, 2021): our understanding of how parents transmit their attitudes to their children remains limited. Drawing on classic findings from the United States (e.g., Jennings et al., 2009), I propose a model of early political socialisation of party identity where parental partisanship, its stability, and strength determine the likelihood of parent-child party identity congruence. Moving beyond current literature, I argue that this process is driven by two mechanisms: parental political interest and parent-child contact. Political interest has previously been conceptualised as an ex-ante determinant of early political socialisation, but empirical evidence is mixed (Jennings et al., 2009; Dinas, 2014); I contend that it does not exert independent influence and is best understood as a moderator that either facilitates or hinders parent-child attitude transmission. Parent-child contact as a mechanism of early political socialisation is a relatively novel proposition: existing research accounting for the role of contact is limited to assessments of differential influences between mothers and fathers on their children (Zuckerman et al., 2007; Coffé and Voorpostel, 2010). I test the proposed model on data from the British Household Panel Survey and the UK Household Longitudinal Survey. The empirical strategy consists of a simultaneous equations model with a panel data estimator.

While existing evidence suggests that states expand education to promote social order, the extent to which it works has not yet been systematically studied. I investigate this issue within the context of 19th-century France, where primary education was explicitly designed to teach obedience. Exploiting quasi-random variation in access to schooling, I do not find evidence that education reduced public dissent in response to the coup of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte in 1851. On the contrary, I show that localities with schools exhibited more insurgent activity and opposition to the regime at the ballot box. Additional results suggest that schools may have facilitated the rise of contentious politics by expanding the readership of newspapers and other written media. These findings demonstrate that education can empower the population, even when it is designed to promote obedience.","Keywords: education, contentious politics, France, protest, mass politics","Alejandro López Peceño","Alejandro López Peceño",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1300_0220_0175.html","Internet Roll-Out and Attitudinal Change: The Case of Abortion","Although abortion remains a highly contested issue worldwide, Latin American countries have experienced an accelerated turn to greater public support for reproductive rights. This shift co-occurred with the expansion of high-speed broadband throughout the region, facilitating individuals' consumption of online content and social media on a global scale. While cultural diffusion approaches predict that new mass media will further disseminate gender-egalitarian scripts, recent evidence suggests that internet-based outlets may increase polarization around ideologically contested issues. We examine how exposure to high-speed broadband at the municipality level impacted individuals' support for abortion policies. We focus on the case of Chile between 2012 and 2019, a period when abortion attitudes radically changed in this country. In particular, we leverage the temporal and geographical variation in Chile's roll-out of high-speed internet and combine it with repeated public opinion data (LAPOP Survey). We estimate two-way fixed effects and staggered event-study models while exploring heterogeneous treatment effects according to individuals' socioeconomic status, age, gender, and religion. Our preliminary findings indicate that access to high-speed internet increases support for abortion policies when the mother's health is at risk, particularly among respondents residing in municipalities where at least 75 percent of the population is exposed to high-speed broadband. Notably, the effect is mostly driven by less educated respondents.","Keywords: Abortion; Internet; Latin America.","Daniela Urbina","Pablo Argote","University of Southern California","Daniela Urbina","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","University of Southern California",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conduct an intergenerational survey to capture how different generations describe the experiences of relatives involved in WWII as soldiers, studying similarities in narratives within families.

However, research on identity activation has either been limited to observational data that cannot directly test for exposure to situational cues or has lacked detailed analysis of real-world examples of these cues. Consequently, it remains unclear whether individuals' contacts and perceptions of the discursive environment activate social identities to guide voting intentions. To address this, we employ difference-in-difference models using real-world experimental data from a rural German municipality where a local citizen council is set up to deliberate on the future of a community-owned building. We investigate whether voting intentions for parties advocating local protectionism increase as a result of contact with this local citizen council and thus the increased public discourse of a local issue.","Keywords: Identity Activation, Citizen Council, Voting Behaviour, Local Identities, Rural Municipality","Antonia May, Anne-Kathrin Stroppe","Antonia May","GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences"," Anne-Kathrin Stroppe","GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the crucial role of evidence in shaping public policy, research rarely explores how politicians choose which evidence to engage with. We examine this in a study of Austrian politicians running for office in 2024 (N = 1,882) and examine how they select evidence on the contentious policy issue of migration. Austrian politicians are presented with two types of high-quality evidence on a Danish welfare reform that significantly reduced benefits for migrants. One supports the welfare magnet hypothesis, aligning with right-wing views on immigration control. The other highlights the socio-economic impact on migrant poverty, resonating with left-wing humanitarian concerns. Building on motivated reasoning, we hypothesize that right-wing politicians will choose welfare magnet evidence at higher rates, while left-wing politicians will focus on migrant poverty. Parties at the fringes of the political spectrum align with our expectation, but the left-wing Social Democratic Party surprisingly selects welfare magnet evidence at rates similar to the far-right Freedom Party. Further analysis of public opinion data (N = 2,400) shows that most parties align with the views of respondents who share their party identity, demonstrating citizen-elite congruence in considering evidence. In sum, this study provides new insights into how politicians engage with evidence in a salient policy area.","Keywords: elite behavior, evidence in politics,","Roman Senninger","Roman Senninger","Aarhus University"," Jesper Hansen","Aarhus University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1304_0463_0782.html","The Impact of National Corruption Scandals on Euroscepticism and Political Trust","From time to time, corruption scandals rock politics on both the national and European levels. How do these scandals impact voters’ attitudes towards politics? Most existing literature focuses on the impact of corruption scandals at the level of government where the corruption occurs, e.g., studies find that scandals involving national politicians reduce trust in national politics. However, corruption scandals may reduce support for and trust in politics more generally, across different levels of government. In this paper, we use three different scandals, all of which broke during the fielding of different waves of the European Social Survey, to explore how scandal impacts voters’ attitudes towards politics across layers of government. We find that scandals on the national level have a tendency to reduce trust and satisfaction both with national politics as well as with European politics. Scandals that occur at the European level, in contrast, reduce trust and support for European politics and politicians, but not national-level politics, and then only among more educated voters. These findings are in direct contrast to existing literature on support for Europe, which suggests that, in the face of increasing corruption and poor government, voters may view Europe in a more positive light.","Keywords: Scandal, Euroskepticism, Trust, Random-Event-In-Survey Design, Regression Discontinuity","Jonathan Slapin","Jonathan Slapin","University of Zürich","Aurora Palanza","University of Zürich","Catherine De Vries","Bocconi University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zürich","Bocconi University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1305_0941_0279.html","Ad Machina: The Political Economy of Delegating Interest Rate Decision-Making to Artificial Intelligence","Under which conditions are citizens willing to delegate government tasks to artificial intelligence? Several studies examine how characteristics of the technology and individuals' relationship to technology impact support for AI policymaking. Our innovation is to examine how the identity of current policymakers impacts public support for delegating decisions to AI. In particular, we argue that in a highly polarized society, AI has the potential to serve as a 'non-partisan' decision maker that has the potential to bring apolitical motivations to government decisions. Following this line of thought, we reason that individuals will prefer co-partisans to AI decision making. However, AI decision making will have more public support when out-partisans hold policy control. To test our hypothesis, we fielded a survey in the summer of 2024 which asked respondents to register their support for AI making the most important economic decision in the world - the setting of the base interest rate by the US Federal Reserve. The basis of our experimental treatments is the fact that Jerome Powell, the current chair of the Federal Reserve, was appointed first by President Trump, a Republican, and later re-appointed by President Biden, a Democrat. Based on this setup, we hypothesize that when we inform respondents that Powell was appointed by Biden (Trump), support for AI delegation decreases (increases) among Democrats and increases (decreases) among Republicans. We find that support for an AI decision maker increases by 35% of a standard deviation when respondents are led to believe the Fed Chair is an out-partisan.","Keywords: AI, Central Banks, Polarization","Matthew DiGiuseppe","Matthew DiGiuseppe","Leiden University","Tobias Rommel","Technical University of Munich","Andreas Kern","Georgetown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leiden University","Technical University of Munich","Georgetown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We remedy these shortcomings by building and analysing the PARTYCLIM Dataset, which positions parties on climate change across 20 industrial countries over the last two decades. The dataset is built in two stages: Firstly, through a supervised machine learning approach using a large multi-lingual language model, XLM-RoBERTa, to identify the climate change content in party manifestos. Secondly, this climate change content is hand-coded by country and climate policy experts. We code both ‘pro’ and ‘anti’ climate change content, allowing for the development of a positional measure. We also code the subcategories of climate policy included in the manifestos, and identify policy proposals and whether these are ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ climate policies. The result is the largest and richest dataset on parties’ climate change positions to date, constituting a significant contribution to the field of comparative and climate politics. The aim of this paper is therefore to present the PARTYCLIM Dataset and analyse key patterns revealed by it.","Keywords: Climate Change, Political Parties, Comparative Politics, Supervised Machine Learning, Large Language Models, Industrialised Countries","Fay Madeleine Farstad","Fay Madeleine Farstad","Department of Comparative Politics, University of Bergen, Norway","Julià Tudó Cisquella","Department of Comparative Politics, University of Bergen, Norway","Conor Little","Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Limerick, Ireland","Neil Carter","Department of Politics and International Relations, University of York, UK","Matto Mildenberger","Department of Political Science, UC Santa Barbara, USA","Olivia Quinn","Department of Political Science, UC Santa Barbara, USA","Bruce Tranter","School of Social Sciences, University of Tasmania, Australia","","","","","","","Department of Comparative Politics, University of Bergen, Norway","Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Limerick, Ireland","Department of Politics and International Relations, University of York, UK","Department of Political Science, UC Santa Barbara, USA","School of Social Sciences, University of Tasmania, Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1307_0219_0853.html","Understanding Changes in Partisan Strength: A Machine Learning Approach to Generate Novel Hypotheses","Recent research emphasizes the role of partisan identity, rather than policy preferences, in shaping political behavior and polarization. While existing studies have identified various predictors of partisan strength through theory-driven approaches, less attention has been paid to bottom-up, data-driven methods for hypothesis generation. Our study employs machine learning techniques to analyze the British Election Study panel data (Waves 7-9 and 21-23) to identify novel predictors of changes in partisan strength. Using multiple classification algorithms with different feature selection and transformation methods, we find that Histogram Gradient Boosting with percentile selection consistently outperforms other approaches. Our results reveal distinct predictive patterns between moderate and extreme changes in partisan strength. While moderate changes are better predicted by political engagement metrics, extreme changes are more associated with shifts in economic attitudes and policy preferences. Notably, the models achieve better predictability in later waves (21-23) compared to earlier ones (7-9), suggesting more structured patterns of partisan change as temporal distance from major political events (e.g., Brexit) increases. These findings suggest that changes in partisan strength might follow different mechanisms depending on their magnitude, with moderate changes being more systematic and extreme changes being more environmentally driven. Our study demonstrates the value of machine learning approaches in generating novel hypotheses about partisan identity dynamics and highlights the importance of considering both individual-level attitudes and broader contextual factors in understanding partisan strength changes.","Keywords: partisan strength, machine learning, political psychology, identity, affective polarization, democratic commitment, political engagement","Haoran Shi","Haoran Shi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Department of Psychological and Behavioral Science, LSEData Science Institute, LSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While we know about gender differences in political behaviour, research calls for studies on within-gender differences, for instance in ethnicity and religion. Conversely, most research on ethnic minorities’ political behaviour does not consider gender patterns. To address these gaps, using survey data that oversamples Muslim minorities, we analyse political attitudes and turnout rates of men and women of the ethnic majorities and Muslim minorities in France, the Netherlands and Germany. Building on the intersectionality literature, we theorize and test how the mechanisms of political socialisation, self-interest, and perceived discrimination differently affect men and women of the ethnic majority and Muslim minorities in their political attitudes and turnout rates. Most interestingly, we find that political socialisation (in terms of political interest and religion) and (material) self-interest constitute competing drivers of political behaviour for Muslim women. While Muslim women’s behaviour partly reflects lower political interest (compared to men) and higher religiosity and perceived discrimination (compared to the ethnic majority), it also partly reflects their material self-interest as women, resulting in different gender-ethnicity gaps for different political behaviour indicators. The study contributes to understanding political behaviour in increasingly diverse societies.","Keywords: Gender gaps, Muslim minorities, intersectionality, political behaviour, Western Europe.","Gefjon Off","Gefjon Off","Leuphana University Lüneburg","Sanne van Oosten","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leuphana University Lüneburg","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates how ownership structures and intended use of energy products influence distributional justice perceptions and public support of renewable energy development. I argue that the effects of these factors on public acceptance and justice perceptions are moderated by two key attitudinal factors: resource nationalism and collective psychological ownership. I utilize a multi-country experimental survey design in four European countries with varied renewable energy experiences: Norway, the UK, Germany, and France. Through this design, I examine how resource nationalist and collective ownership attitudes shape preferences for national ownership and domestic use of renewable energy. The research contributes to our understanding of how ownership sentiments and resource nationalism influence social acceptance of renewable energy, with important implications for policy design.","Keywords: Renewable energy, public opinion, social acceptance, distributional justice, climate, wind power","Marte S.

Understanding whether voters support democracy or not has been a recent focus among political scientists, with one of the goals being to figure out where democracy is crumbling and how to prevent that from happening. This paper examines nearly 7,000 open-ended responses from four samples across two different open-ended question stems of academics and the general public and applies text analysis methods and a structural topic model to identify patterns in how people think about democracy. We find that voters prioritize freedoms and people being in charge of the government. This differs strongly from how academics conceptualize democracy, where the structure of democracy and the theory behind it are higher concerns. On average, the general public writes half as much as academics do answering the same question, and they signal that democracy is not top of mind. The events of January 6th are mentioned in only three responses total, showing that those current, relevant events are not included in how people conceptually think about democracy. This paper helps show that the way people think about democracy does not include behavior in office and offers insights into how undemocratic politicians find a place in office.","Keywords: support for democracy, public opinion, democratic health","Alejandra Aldridge","Alejandra Aldridge",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Brigham Young University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Against a backdrop of declining turnouts and democratic backsliding, this paper aims to illuminate what people dislike about voting – and what such anti-voting meanings relate to.Using answers of 23,828 citizens from 12 highly diverse countries, this paper uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze the question “what does ‘voting’ mean to you?” The initial aim is to create a citizen-perspective classification of anti-voting meanings. These may include both existing interpretations of voting (lack of political efficacy, political disillusionment, lack of political interest, costs of voting) as well as novel perspectives inductively gathered from citizens’ own words. In a second step, these meanings are quantitatively related to institutional and individual factors within our unique dataset.To achieve this ambitious project, any answer that is negative about the act of voting is manually coded by several coders. Subsequently, these answers (N = 1775) are inductively analyzed through a grounded theory approach to investigate what citizens dislike about voting – creating a novel classification of anti-voting meanings. A final round of quantitative coding of this novel classification enables the quantitative analysis in relation to other variables in the dataset, such as societal position, level of democracy of the country or political preferences.While there are no results of this study yet, data collection is completed, and data analysis has already commenced.","Keywords: voting, citizen perspective, negativity","Ming M.

Typically, these tools are thought to be less biased as they use computational methods for policing tasks. How do Americans view these tools, however? And do those evaluations differ depending who supports the use of AI in policing? We field a survey experiment that manipulates AI type and whether the sponsor is a governmental or private entity to explore the contours of support for these tools in the American public. Surprisingly, we find that facial recognition receives more support than general AI tools, particularly among white and Republican respondents. We see little differences in support depending on whether the sponsor is a local police chief or a private entity.

Spatial proximity and social identity predict public opinion on nuclear waste","Little is known about public opinion on where to host a long-term repository for radioactive waste. This study first tests whether spatial proximity – i.e., the distance in kilometers of a person’s place of residence to the location of a repository – affects three dependent variables: whether proximity a) increases personal relevance of the hosting decision, b) decreases acceptance of this decision, and c) increases the likelihood for opinion expression. Second, it examines whether the effect of proximity weakens when the site selected is located in a region relevant to a person’s social identity, so that acceptance for the site selected decreases not only for geographically close but also for geographically distant locations.Results come from two representative CATI-CAWI survey experiments exposing different participants to different vignettes concerning the hypothetical selection of a site for a repository (total n = 3,015).The first 5x1-experiment manipulated spatial proximity of the site selected to respondent’s place of residence (5/30/50/100/200 km). Results confirm that spatial proximity increases personal relevance and decreases acceptance of the hosting decision. The second 3x2-experiment tested whether the effect of spatial proximity (5/30/50 km) changes when telling respondents that the site selected is located in their own (vs. another) region. Results reveal a significant interaction: While spatial distance significantly decreases personal relevance when located in another region, personal relevance does not decrease by spatial distance when still located in respondent’s own region. Further mediation analysis shows that personal relevance subsequently influences acceptance and opinion expression about the hosting decision.","Keywords: opinion expression, nuclear waste, social identity, public opinion, survey experiment","Johannes Kaiser","Johannes Kaiser",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management, Berlin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1314_1291_0083.html","The Value of Public Health","We estimate the value of a public health system exploiting a conjoint experiment in nationally representative surveys in Brazil, France and the United States in which respondents choose between different societies that randomly vary in their economic outcomes (country income, income inequality, social mobility), political outcomes (public healthcare, democracy), and the level of personal income for each respondent. This allows us to estimate the respondents’ willingness to trade off publicly provided healthcare for individual income as well as other societal attributes. We find that, on average, individuals have a strong preference for a public health system. They would need a large increase, equal to two times the average income of the country in France, and equal to 50\% of the average income of the country in Brazil and the US. Most respondents support public healthcare and they do it with more intensity than its opponents. Demand for state-provided healthcare is largely driven by other-regarding preferences. Respondents that think that poverty is the outcome of luck or lack of connections, and those who lean to the political left and believe the world is zero-sum are more likely to support a public health system. Demographic traits seem uncorrelated with support for a public health system -- with the exception of household wealth, which is associated with lower levels of support in France and the US.","Keywords: public health system, willingness to pay, welfare state, redistribution, conjoint experiment, other-regarding preferences","Andreu Arenas","Alicia Adserà","Princeton University","Andreu Arenas","University of Barcelona (IEB, IPERC), Ivàlua","Carles Boix","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Barcelona (IEB, IPERC), Ivàlua","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1315_1145_0177.html","Supply-Side Approaches to Misinformation: Evidence from Field and Survey Experiments in Brazil","Strategies to counter political misinformation have largely focused on demand-side approaches, equipping voters to avoid, detect, fact-check, or report false information. However, since elites play a central role in disseminating misinformation, governments have increasingly adopted supply-side strategies, imposing legal penalties on individuals who spread falsehoods. Brazil’s new regulations, introduced after the storming of the presidential palace in 2023, exemplify this trend. Beginning in 2024, a key government body systematically monitors the online behavior of candidates and prosecutes offenders.This paper examines whether informing candidates about these penalties reduces the flow of misinformation they endorse. Beyond this, we test whether alternative messaging strategies can achieve similar effects. Using a field experiment with almost 3,000 mayors running for reelection in Brazil, we evaluate the impact of different messaging strategies on the online behavior of candidates. Additionally, we conducted a survey experiment with city council candidates to investigate the mechanisms behind these behavioral changes.Our findings show that informing candidates about penalties significantly improves their discernment of misinformation, leading them to avoid sharing false content at higher rates. However, this approach also reduces the overall volume of social media activity, indicating a potential chilling effect. Importantly, we find that gentler, nudge-based interventions may be equally effective in reducing misinformation without suppressing overall engagement.These results have significant implications for governments and online platforms seeking sustainable approaches to combating misinformation. While strong supply-side measures can mitigate misinformation, they may inadvertently deter broader social media participation, raising questions about their long-term impact on democratic discourse.","Keywords: misinformation, experiment, Brazil, mayors","Fernando B.

"abstract_1316_0555_0389.html","Forgive or Forget? Examining the Generational Transmission of Historical Narratives and Ethnic Prejudice in Post-Conflict Settings","Many governments in post-conflict settings attempt to erase their violent pasts, leaving out all or large parts of their history from school curricula. While some hope this policy will help individuals forget the past and move on, it may simply allow local, polarized versions of the past to flourish, fueling current divisions. When past conflicts are not discussed openly in schools, what and where do younger generations learn about their nation's violent past, and how do these narratives affect inter-group relations? When are resentments and heightened prejudices sustained and passed down to youth, and when do they fade? I answer these questions using evidence from Nigeria - which has rarely taught its history in the 50 years since its Biafran Civil War. Surveying 2584 secondary school students and their parents across 1292 households, I find that without formal education most families have passed on surprisingly few details about the war to their children. Children are also unlikely to learn much from other sources. However, the (vague) knowledge of the war youth do have tends to be ethnically charged, particularly among the most victimized group, and this sentiment is correlated with current ethnic prejudice and support for secessionist movements. Crucially, these findings hold both in places with contemporary grievances and segregation, and those with integration. This suggests the passage of time and inter-ethnic contact may not be enough for past tensions to fade, but instead more direct engagement with details about past conflict (including through formal education) could help peace-building.","Keywords: peace-building, prejudice, Africa, conflict legacies","Narrelle Gilchrist","Narrelle Gilchrist",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research delves deeper into the determinants of tactical voting by attempting to understad how do personal and systemic characteristics shape the impact of personalised political information on tactical voting. We employ data from the largest voter advice application (VAA) in Spain (N=500,000), run in the context of the July 23, 2023, national elections. This digital tool was combined with a survey experiment were we randomly presented users with their levels of political congruence with different political parties before and after assessing their voting probabilities. Our findings are as follows. First, displaying political congruence with the different political parties increases the likelihood of voting for the own party, while decreases the likelihood for voting for the others--particularly within ideological blocks. Second, individuals scoring lower congruence with their preferred party are more impacted by the treatment. Third, when a different party from the preferred one appears to be first ranked, the treatment advantage for the party aimed to vote vanishes. Fourth, centrist voters are the most affected by the treatment condition. Overall, these findings highlight the role of personalised political information in a fragmented electoral context and confirm that such information reinforces pre-existing electoral intentions but rarely converts them. Our study contributes to understanding how digital tools influence voting behavior, providing evidence of their nuanced effects on voter decision-making in complex electoral settings.","Keywords: Electoral Behaviour, Spain, Tactical Voting, Congruence.","Marc Guinjoan","Marc Guinjoan","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Toni Rodon","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Nikandros Ioannidis","Cyprus University of Technology","Costas Djoivas","Cyprus University of Technology","Fernando Méndez","University of Zurich","","","","","","","","","","","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Universitat Pompeu Fabra","Cyprus University of Technology","University of Zurich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This argument however rests on the assumption that young legislators advance their own age groups’ interests substantively. To investigate this, we ask: Are the interests of young voters better represented by young legislators? Using the GLES 2021 candidate and citizen surveys from Germany, we investigate whether young voters and young candidates differ from their parties regarding attitudes on environmental, immigration and economic issues and whether young voters and young candidates of the same party are more congruent. While we find that attitudes of young voters and young candidates differ systematically from their parties, this does not translate into higher congruence between the two. Contrary to our expectations, preferences of young voters appear to be relatively well represented, also by older legislators. These findings provide new insight into the (under)representation of young voters as they show that the underrepresentation of young voters’ interests is driven by cross-party variation and does not persist within parties. This highlights the need for policy changes to increase substantial youth representation beyond nominating more young candidates.","Keywords: Congruence, Representation, Youth","Mathis Brinkmann","Mathis Brinkmann","Leuphana University Lüneburg","Julius Diener","University of Mannheim","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Leuphana University Lüneburg","University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While earlier studies, primarily conducted during periods of low inflation, emphasized inflation aversion among asset holders and its association with age, political conservatism, and income, these findings require reevaluation in light of the recent inflation surge across advanced democracies. This study examines public attitudes toward inflation-related policies using Italy as a case study—a country that experienced significant inflation from 2021 to 2024. Leveraging observational and experimental survey data, we investigate: (i) how individuals perceive and experience inflation; (ii) support for policies with inflationary or disinflationary consequences; and (iii) the causal effects of policy framing on public support.Our analysis encompasses a diverse set of policies, including those theorized to increase inflation (e.g., increased social spending, stricter labor protections, reform of ECB independence, and military aid to Ukraine) and those theorized to reduce it (e.g., price controls, wage caps, interest rate hikes, and reduced inter-regional transfers). By  using an experimenta setting, we show that the preferecens for policies with (dis-)inflationary consequences exploring changs whem these consequences are made present to voters. This study contributes to the broader literature by reassessing outdated theoretical claims and offering rigorous causal evidence on how framing policy trade-offs influences support for inflation-related measures. Our findings have implications for understanding the political dynamics of inflation and policy preferences in other OECD contexts experiencing similar economic pressures.","Keywords: inflation, experiments; Italy, preferences","Ignacio Jurado","Ignacio Jurado","Juan March-Carlos III Institute / University Carlos III","Alexander Kuo","University of Oxford","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Juan March-Carlos III Institute / University Carlos III","University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this sense, the literature tends to focus on green and radical right parties, often overlooking centre-to-right parties, despite their presence in multiple national governments and coalitions and the significant variations in their positions that remain underexplored. Using a mixed-methods approach, a multilingual large language model (XLM-RoBERTa) is fine-tuned to identify climate-related content in party manifestos, which is then manually coded to position the parties. To do so, all the quasi-sentences from the manifestos are coded as pro-climate, anti-climate, neutral, or irrelevant, following a codebook that establishes multiple climate policy categories and subcategories. Drawing on existing literature on issue ownership and party competition, I investigate the main factors shaping centrist and mainstream centre-right parties' stances on climate change across 20 industrialized countries over the last two decades. I specifically focus on the roles of incumbency, fossil fuel dependency, public attitudes, and the influence of radical right performance, while also accounting for variations across time and countries.","Keywords: climate policy, party positions, party competition, mainstream right, radical right","Julià Tudó-Cisquella","Julià Tudó-Cisquella",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Bergen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1321_0229_0851.html","Simulating Party Competition in Dynamic Voter Distributions","We study strategic party interaction in a spatial voting model where voters’ ideological positions may change. Building on a rich empirical and theoretical literature, we assume that voters align their ideology with others who are sufficiently close to them (social influence with bounded confidence) as well as with the party that they support (party attraction). We show that these changes have strong implications on the results of the party competition model by Laver (2005). Two strategies stand out in our simulations: Aggregators, who always follow the mean policy of their supporters, and predators, who always chase the strongest party. Aggregators are most likely to win in a large corridor of the parameter space. However, predators can outperform them if party attraction is strong. This is interesting because predators are on average the worst-performing parties in the static voter distribution benchmark. We argue that these results are connected to real-world debates about how mainstream parties should react to the rise of extremist parties, as the two strategies epitomize debates about focusing on own strengths and supporters (aggregators) vs. adapting towards successful extremists (predators). We also demonstrate that the level of polarization and fragmentation of parties and voters is strongly affected by social influence and party attraction. While medium-sized confidence bounds and party attraction increase the polarization of voters and parties, unconstrained social influence decreases it.","Keywords: Spatial voting model, opinion dynamics, agent-based model","Leonie Geyer","Leonie Geyer","Zeppelin University","Patrick Mellacher","University of Graz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zeppelin University","University of Graz",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individual Preferences for Intersectional and Substantive Representation","While vast literatures explored the role of political representation in terms of isolated identities such as gender or race, many questions remain about how these identities interact. We develop an experimental framework to explore why certain types of representation are more important for different social groups and how converging social identities may mobilize voters. We test our theory based on a preregistered survey experiment conducted as part of the 2022 Cooperative Election Study. Shortly before the U.S. midterm elections, our respondents participated in a visual conjoint experiment that matched them with various (fictional) lawmakers from different states. Respondents were asked to evaluate how well they would feel represented in each legislature based on the lawmaker's photo, their individual policy overlap, as well as the state legislatures' composition with respect to party, race, and gender. As part of the conjoint, we manipulated whether policy overlap with each lawmaker focuses on issues specifically related to gender, race, or general policies. This design allows us to identify diverging preferences for different types of descriptive and substantive representation among historically underrepresented groups. We further contextualize these findings with data from a post-election wave after the midterms where respondents are asked to evaluate how represented they feel by their own state legislatures. In addition to contrasting individual preferences for different types of representation, our approach allows us to examine how differently positioned groups perceive politicians that share (or do not share) various components of their identity, and how it motivates subsequent political participation.","Keywords: gender, race, representation, intersectional, conjoint","Patrick Kraft","Kathleen Dolan","University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","Patrick Kraft","Carlos III University of Madrid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","Carlos III University of Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article examines how rural residents interpret the green transition and climate policies, arguing that their attitudes are shaped by the material and cultural dimensions of their place. Based on 53 interviews conducted in three diverse rural contexts in France, it explains why people in different rural areas end up sharing similar concerns. The study introduces a place-based framework that highlights the interplay between the material conditions and cultural narratives attached to rural life, producing resistance through three interconnected place-based grievances: (i) perceptions of unjust economic burdens imposed by the transition, (ii) perceived clashes with rural identities, norms, and representations, (iii) feelings of exclusion and neglect by urban decision-makers. Findings suggest that resistance to climate policies must be understood through the lens of place, emphasizing the need for context-sensitive strategies to foster rural support.","Keywords: climate policy; place; context; rural; public opinion","Theodore Tallent","Theodore Tallent",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Centre for European Studies and Comparative politics, CNRS, Sciences Po, Paris, France.2Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1324_0878_1455.html","(Un)conditional Support? How Disagreement Affects Citizens’ Perceived Importance of Free Speech for Democracy","Citizens' support for democracy is crucial to the stability and legitimacy of contemporary liberal democracies. While declared endorsement of democratic principles is widespread, we know less about how conditional that support may be. Recent literature mainly examines the conditionality of democratic support through the lens of willingness to back undemocratic politicians (e.g., Graham and Svolik 2020; Frederiksen 2022), but less is known about how this conditionality manifests beyond voting behavior. To address this gap, this paper examines whether citizens see free speech as equally important for democracy when it is applied to individuals they disagree with as when it is applied to those they agree with. Through a survey experiment conducted in seven European countries, Study 1 examines this mechanism in the context of abortion. Study 2, conducted in Germany and the U.S., broadens the scope by exploring whether the type of issue influences citizens’ willingness to extend freedom of speech to those they disagree with. I find that citizens view free speech as more important for democracy when they agree with the content of the speech, compared to when they disagree. This confirms that support for democracy is not unconditional and that citizens can employ double standards when it comes to whom they grant democratic rights. This has implications for the inclusiveness of contemporary democracies, as it implies the lack of universal application of democratic principles, and is especially concerning in increasingly polarized societies.","Keywords: free speech; support for democracy; tolerance; disagreement; survey experiments;","Marta Vukovic","Marta Vukovic",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Vienna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, the measurement of the national identities of European citizens remains a contested issue in the scholarly literature. Despite its widespread use in public opinion surveys, the so-called ‘Moreno question’ has been criticized as it forces respondents to choose between bipolar, competitive categories of national identities that may not fully capture the complexity of national political identities (Bochsler et al., 2021; Levy, 2014; Sinnott, 2006). Through this paper we explore the consequences of an under-discussed problem of Moreno-style questions: the aprioristic definition of the two possible national identities between which respondents are asked to position themself. The eurosceptic turn of many stateless nationalist parties in Europe after the early 2000s (Huysseune, 2010; Massetti & Schakel, 2021) underscores the limitations of this methodological approach, as it remains blind to citizens who hold strong national sentiments but identify with neither European institutions nor their nation-state. Casting this distinctive group of citizens aside in the basket of non-respondents may introduce a significant bias in empirical analyses. In this communication, we will explore the patterns of nonresponse to the Eurobarometer question on national and European identities among voters of both Eurosceptic and Europhile stateless regionalist parties and discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of our findings.","Keywords: national identities, European integration, survey methodology, public opinion, stateless nationalism.","Matteo Giuliani-Pedraza, Daniel Romero-Portillo","Matteo Giuliani-Pedraza","Universidad Pablo de Olavide"," Daniel Romero-Portillo","Universidad Pablo de Olavide","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Pablo de Olavide",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1326_0888_1466.html","Public Opinion on Government Surveillance of Smartphones","Recent terrorist attacks and the perceived need to tackle online crime have led to a debate at both national and European level about strengthening national security through online surveillance policies. However, the proposed and partially implemented policies also represent an infringement of personal freedoms through state surveillance.There already exists a growing body of literature on public attitudes towards government surveillance in general (Davis/Silver 2004; Garcia/Geva 2016; Trüdinger/Steckermeier 2017; Antoine 2022). However, public opinion towards surveillance policies is not a fixed attitude, it is rather formed through an evaluation of a complex situation in which the design of the policies and institutional context matters (Pavone/Esposti, 2010). The effect of the specific technical and legal implementation of surveillance policies thereby remains understudied. This study therefore uses data from an original factorial survey experiment with 1000 participants, to be conducted in Germany in January 2025, to measure public opinion towards government surveillance policies on smartphones.The analysis will consider the context of implementation, operationalised by the rationale for implementation, either the fight against terrorism or the fight against crime. In addition, the effect of the scope and intrusiveness of the policy will be considered by manipulating the type of data that is monitored and the number of people potentially affected by the surveillance policy. The effect of institutional control will be measured by the presence or absence of mandatory court orders. Finally, the effect of the use of artificial intelligence in the surveillance process will be examined.","Keywords: policy preferences, surveillance, survey experiment, public oppinion","Bruno Albert","Bruno Albert",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Bavarian Research Institut for Digital Transformation (BIDT)Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On the Influence of Rental Prices on Satisfaction with Local Public Administration in German Cities","Trends in local housing prices represent relevant and visible cues on the national and local economy for citizens. Previous research demonstrated that changes in local housing prices influence political attitudes, such as support for incumbent governments or political preferences. While this research largely focused on homeowners, less is known about how housing price changes influence renters’ political attitudes. Since renting and owning are profoundly different experiences—renting being a cost and owning an asset—housing price changes may impact renters very differently from homeowners. This study addresses this research gap by examining the influence of local rental prices on residents’ satisfaction with local public administration. Empirically, the study draws on data from an original large-N geocoded survey, enriched with data on local rental prices, which was conducted in ten large German cities with different rental markets and pricing characteristics. The results of multilevel regressions show a negative relationship between high levels of rental prices as well as increasing rental prices over time and satisfaction with local public administration. This negative relationship appears to be mainly driven by exposure to particularly high rental price increases.","Keywords: political satisfaction, rental prices, housing, multilevel regressions, Germany","Teresa Hummler","Teresa Hummler",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Duisburg-Essen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1328_1640_0084.html","The Politics of Mass Higher Education Provision","Historically and today, universities are portrayed as hotbeds of political activism and contention. During moments of protest and political instability, politicians often resort to blaming universities for radicalizing those involved. From an academic perspective, research links the availability of higher education to increased levels of civic engagement (Glaeser et al., 2007; Hillygus, 2005; Verba et al., 1995), the circulation of new and potentially subversive ideas (Benavot, 1996), and the cultivation of alternative sets of elites (Hollenbach et al., 2020). In this way, higher education can challenge the status quo and even the state’s authority. Despite these threats, most countries around the world rapidly expanded access to higher education in the mid-twentieth century. This global transition from elite-only higher education to mass access to higher education (Trow, 2006) has gone largely unexplored, particularly in the political science literature. Thus, this research examines why, all of the sudden, access to higher education expanded across the globe in the mid-twentieth century. In particular, it assesses the plausibility of the “usual suspects” — democratization and economic development— to explain this change alongside less-common explanations such as security threats and diffusion. Leveraging a mixed-methods design, the paper examines cross-national associations between tertiary enrollment rates and theoretical drivers of higher education provision and further investigates these relationships with selected case studies.","Keywords: Education, Higher Education, Civic Engagement","Katy Norris","Katy Norris",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Student, University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, evidence from elsewhere suggests derived biases in the acquisition, processing, and recall of information shape the formation of attitudes, political behavior, and broader dynamics of polarization. In a lab-in-the-field experiment in Ghana (n » 1,200) we study how both positive and negative partisan identities condition voters’ vulnerability to misinformation and their adoption of congenial versus avoidance of discordant information. Our findings shed light on the wide-reaching effects of the psychological salience of group identities, identifying increases bias in evaluating both political and non-political information. Furthermore, we contribute (to our knowledge) the first study to experimentally prime positive and negative partisan identities and study their respective effects, highlighting the plurality of modes through which voters can be drawn into electoral politics and the divergent patterns of behavior they bring.","Keywords: Misinformation, Partisanship, Psychology, Africa, Polarization","Paul Atwell","Paul Atwell","Universidad Carlos III (Juan March Institute); Ohio State University","Simon Chauchard","Universidad Carlos III (Juan March Institute)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Carlos III (Juan March Institute)","Ohio State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Memory and Historical Violence in Wartime  Mobilization","To what extent can historical instances of mass violence explain individuals' motivations to join armed conflicts? What decisions do former combatants make during periods of rapid political and social transformation in times of uncertainty, such as the pre-war stage? What impact does large-scale historical violence during wartime have on the mobilization of individuals? Recent studies show that violent events have long-lasting effects transmitted across generations, shaping political views, voting behavior, and attitudes. However, research often theorizes long-term legacies without clarifying the underlying transmission mechanisms, such as intergenerational memory and silence. This study empirically tests if communities that experienced past violence are more likely to mobilize for war. Focusing on Bosnia and Herzegovina, I compare how World War II events in two towns severely impacted by violence as evidenced by mortality statistics from death data affected mobilization in the 1990s conflict. The research combines original survey data with extensive fieldwork involving wartime veterans to explore the relationship between secondary victimization during World War II and combat participation in the 1990s. The micro-level analysis reveals how family narratives and local memories of past violence shape individual decisions in times of uncertainty, contributing to the understanding of long-term legacies of violence and mobilization patterns.","Keywords: Historical mass violence, Mobilization, Intergenerational memory, World War II, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Ajla Henic Sarajlic","Ajla Henic Sarajlic",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Hamburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While some voters commit early to their preferences and do not change them, many remain undecided until late in the campaign, influencing the strategies of political parties and candidates as well as the election's outcomes.This study examines voting timing in concurrent regional and local elections in Slovakia, both of which use the first-past-the-post electoral system. Based on an online representative post-election survey (N = 1,000), it explores whether voter decision timing differs between these two elections and identifies factors that can be associated with late decisions.The results show that in less salient elections—those for regional presidents—voters decided much closer to the election date, whereas in municipal mayoral elections, most voters decided more than a month beforehand. Additionally, findings from a multinomial regression align with previous research, showing that women, younger voters, and those less interested in politics are more likely to be late deciders in both types of elections.","Keywords: Voter Decision Timing, Second-Order Elections, Slovakia","Jozef Zagrapan","Jozef Zagrapan",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institute for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An Experimental Study of Politicians' Ability to Correctly Identify Individual Voters' Ideology and Issue Positions","Recent studies have found that politicians misperceive their constituents’ policy preferences, ideology, and socio-demographic characteristics. These studies focus almost exclusively on perceptions of large masses of constituents: the residents in a politician’s electoral district, the supporters of the politician’s political party, or citizens in general. While these are theoretically important groups, politicians themselves often emphasize that they are focused on contact with and information from particular constituents rather than aggregate signals. As a result, politicians may be more accurate when trying to assess the ideology or opinions of individual constituents.In this paper, we survey Canadian local politicians (N~800) and measure how well they know specific kinds of constituents. Using a novel pre-registered experiment, we ask them to estimate the ideological self-placement and policy preferences of constituents whose specific characteristics vary by age, gender, racial identity, education, immigrant status, duration in the community, home ownership, and party identification. We then measure the accuracy of these perceptions using data from a large survey (N~6,500) of the general public that allows for precise estimates of different types of constituents. This research design allows us to answer three questions on elite perceptual accuracy: (a) whether politicians have more accurate perceptions of some constituents than others; (b) whether politicians have accurate perceptions of differences across demographic groups; and (c) whether politicians’ tendency to overestimate constituents’ conservatism applies consistently across demographic groups.","Keywords: representation; elite Political Behavior; experiments","Jack Lucas","Jack Lucas","University of Calgary","Lior Sheffer","Tel Aviv University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Calgary","Tel Aviv University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use an education reform removing compulsory foreign language instruction in English secondary schools in 2004 to identify the causal effect of language learning on EU support.Theory suggests that speaking foreign languages reduces perceptions of cultural distance and contributes to the formation of transnational identities (Kuhn 2011). Focusing on attitudes towards the Europe Union, research also shows a link between foreign language skills and European identity (Kuhn 2015, Díez -Medrano 2017, Kappe 2020). This research relies on self-reported language skills and correlational evidence.Our research design overcomes common challenges relating to endogeneity and self-reporting by using exogenous variation in foreign language learning due to an education reform: From 2004 onwards, modern foreign languages were no longer a compulsory subject for the important ‘GCSE’ exams in England. As a consequence, uptake of foreign language subjects dropped significantly. We are able to use the curriculum change as an instrument to identify the causal effect of language instruction on EU support and vote choice in a large-scale probability household panel survey by linking it to detailed administrative data on English pupils' school records.Our results show that studying foreign languages causes people to become more pro-European. By studying a change in the subjects that students in England were compelled to study, we estimate that foreign language learning decreased support for both Brexit and Eurosceptic radical right parties, and increased support for pro-European parties.","Keywords: Education, Foreign Languages, Euroscepticism, Brexit, Causal Inference","Roland Kappe","Roland Kappe","University College London","Nicole Martin","University of Manchester","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University College London","University of Manchester",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1334_2327_0281.html","The Politics of Interest Rates: How Monetary Shocks Sway Voter Intentions","The role of monetary policy in shaping electoral outcomes has gained renewed attention amid rising inflation, interest rate hikes, and recent geopolitical instability. Despite its significance, this relationship remains insufficiently explored, leaving important questions unanswered about whether and how monetary policy decisions influence voter intentions and support for political parties. This paper investigates the potential link between unexpected changes in interest rates and voter support for incumbent parties, focusing on the broader implications for economic voting and political accountability.To address this question, we leverage a high-frequency daily dataset of monetary surprises (Altavilla et al., 2019), which captures unexpected responses in EONIA swap rates immediately following European Central Bank (ECB) announcements. Additionally, we use a long and uninterrupted series of public opinion data from the Spanish CIS barometer, spanning from 1986 to 2023. By combining these datasets, with the overlap starting in 1999, we analyze how unanticipated interest rate changes influence voters’ perceptions of the economic situation and their voting intentions.Our findings contribute to the literature at the intersection of empirical, state-of-the-art macroeconomics and political science by providing robust evidence on the political consequences of monetary policy. Leveraging high-frequency monetary surprises as an instrumental variable enhances the identification of causal effects, demonstrating that these unexpected shifts significantly influence public perceptions of economic performance and voter intentions toward incumbent parties. This research is particularly timely given recent inflationary pressures and the heightened political salience of central bank decisions, offering novel insights into the sociopolitical ramifications of monetary policy.","Keywords: Economic Voting, Monetary Policy,  Inflation, Mainstream parties","Rubén Gonzálvez","Rubén Gonzálvez","Complutense University of Madrid"," Daniel F.

Estimating European Challenger Parties' Positions on the Environment from Legislative Speeches, 2009-2019","Right-wing populist challengers have traditionally avoided environmental issues, as these have long been dominated by green parties and associated with the political left. However, in the second decade of the 21st century, environmental issues gained prominence across Europe due to growing public concern about climate change, prompting some right-wing populist challengers to engage with this issue in unexpected ways. This paper examines under which conditions and how these parties addressed environmental issues between 2009 and 2019.Applying computational text analysis to legislative speeches from ParlEE data set  over the selected period, we estimate party positions on the environment across the political spectrum, focusing on both left-wing and right-wing challenger as well as mainstream parties. We examine whether right-wing populists have accommodated the “green” stance on environmental issues and shifted their positions in response to rising salience or used it strategically to challenge mainstream parties. Thus, we bring together the demand and supply sides of politics, emphasizing issue salience, parties’ strategic positionings and the framing of environmental concerns.Our findings contribute to understanding the strategic adaptation of challenger parties to shifting issue salience in European politics and the evolving role of environmental issues in party competition that challenges the conventional left-right environmental divide.","Keywords: environment,  party competition, legislative speeches, computational text analysis, EU","Daniela Giannetti","Daniela Giannetti","University of Bologna","Karen Umansky","University of Potsdam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Bologna","University of Potsdam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1337_2045_1051.html","Mating Market Competition and Gender Norms","We study norms regulating socially acceptable female behavior and the effects of between-group competition in the mating market on their development. We focus on a case study featuring an inflow of ethnic Greek refugees arriving from Turkey following the Greco-Turkish conflict in the early 20th century and examine how the composition of the incoming refugee population influenced gender norms in the affected localities. We leverage the fact that the conflict in Turkey resulted in a large number of men being captured or executed before they could emigrate. Consequently, women were overrepresented in the refugee population, triggering a competition shock in the mating market. At the time, prevailing norms stigmatized women living outside male-headed households, making female refugees particularly vulnerable to stereotypes of low moral standards. We conjecture that for a sufficient level of competition, a local individual has an incentive to double down on conservative gender norms as a means of undermining the newcomer-competitors, even if this does not align with their true preferences. Individuals invested in the mating prospects of local women may benefit from emphasizing female `purity' as a valued trait, thereby amplifying the locals' comparative advantage over the morally stigmatized competition. We hypothesize that this, in turn, led to an increased value placed on conservative values signaled by female behavior. To study this idea, we exploit the variation in the gender composition of refugees in a given locality as a proxy for the intensity of competition, relying on the as-good-as-random allocation of refugees determined by Greek authorities.","Keywords: social norms, stigmatization, gender,","Biljana Meiske","Biljana Meiske","European University Institute"," Elias Dinas","European University Institute","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"European University Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What factors determine whether a person holds consistent climate attitudes? This article investigates the concern-policy support gap, which occurs when the concern about climate change and the degree of support for a policy are not aligned. Using the literature on exogenous shocks, related to natural disasters and economic crises, it is claimed that people who have been directly impacted more by climate change will have their attitudes more aligned than people who have been less affected. The opposite is happening with people more affected by economic deprivation, who will have less coherence between attitudes than those less affected. But it is not only the exogenous factors that are important; the direct or indirect cost of a policy will be a determining factor in keeping the concern about climate change and the predisposition to accept this measure aligned. In addition, it is expected to find that in those policies that imply a higher cost for the citizen, the coherence between attitudes will be lower. To verify this, a new exclusive panel survey has been used to collect climate attitudes such as assessments of different measures or the degree of concern about climate change. With these data it can be seen that exogenous shocks, economic or climatic, affect the coherence between climatic attitudes, although it is vital to consider the cost of such a policy for the citizen.","Keywords: Climate change, public opinion, panel.","Alvaro Fernandez","Alvaro Fernandez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UC3M",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast, its horizontal dimension—divisions between groups within society—has primarily been explored in European contexts, focusing on nativist attitudes toward immigrants. However, how populism shapes attitudes toward outgroups remains understudied, particularly in contexts where nativism is not the primary horizontal divide. This gap is especially critical, as attitudes toward the electoral and liberal rights of outgroups have profound implications for democratic backsliding.This paper examines the impact of populist attitudes on outgroup rights by bridging two strands of literature: the effect of populist attitudes on outgroup perspectives and their impact on democratic attitudes. Using original survey data from Turkey, where in- and out-group designations are primarily situated around partisanship and not nativity, we find that higher levels of populist attitudes are significantly associated with reduced recognition of outgroups' electoral and liberal rights. These findings reveal a new mechanism through which populist attitudes undermine democracy—beyond eroding support for liberal democratic institutions such as the separation of powers and rule of law. By diminishing support for the rights of outgroups, populist attitudes threaten the foundations of democratic rule.","Keywords: Populist attitudes, outgroup rights, democratic backsliding, democratic attitudes, Turkey","Busra Soylemez-Karakoc","Busra Soylemez-Karakoc","Koc University"," Selim Erdem Aytac","Koc University"," Seda Calisir","Koc University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Koc University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1340_1444_1459.html","Social desirability bias and attitudes toward the EU","An extensive body of literature examines the determinants of pro-European attitudes. Yet, the literature has so far overlooked the potential influence of social desirability bias (SDB): the tendency to report responses in line with what is perceived as broadly acceptable. Prima facie evidence suggests that SDB may play a role in pro-European dispositions because it has already proven relevant in regards to a closely related topic: immigration attitudes. This study, therefore, examines the role of SDB through an (already-conducted) online representative sample in Germany (N=3500) and a combination of experimental and cross-sectional analyses. The experimental section implements a conjoint analysis with an already-validated strategy specifically designed to capture the net influence of SDB. Our experiment presents participants with two imaginary parties and seven dimensions of their platforms. The key dimension concerns support for further concessions of decision-making power from Germany to the EU.  The cross-sectional section draws on an already-validated battery of SDB attitudes and structural equation models to assess if SDB has a direct effect on an index of pro-European dispositions. This section also explores if SDB mediates the influence of a high level of education on pro-European dispositions. In line with our expectations, we find that there is a positive correlation  between higher social desirability and education levels. However, contrary to our expectation, we find that higher social desirability is associated with lower support for European integration. This surprising finding  has important implications for understanding the current social debate about the EU.","Keywords: social desirability bias, euroscepticism, conjoint analysis","Ilona Lahdelma","Ilona Lahdelma","Universidad Carlos III; Juan March Institute","Juan Jésus Fernandez","Universidad Carlos III; Juan March Institute","Sebastian Lavezzolo","Universidad Carlos III; Juan March Institute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad Carlos III","Juan March Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Populist and artificial intelligence democracy attitudes in Chile, Spain, and the U.S.","Public opinion studies have observed that dissatisfaction with politics and the functioning of democracy is on the rise in numerous countries (Kriesi, 2020). While comprehensive diagnoses are necessarily multicausal, this phenomenon seems to correlate with growing percentages of the population that cast doubts about the ability of elected representatives and politicians, specially form mainstream parties, to respond to the demands of the electorate. However, the representative role exercised by conventional politicians can be challenged at least from two different perspectives, a populist (that focuses on the people) and a technocratic one (that focuses on experts), each one with its own set of antecedents and consequences (Bertsou and Caramani, 2020). This paper contributes to this discussion by measuring citizens’ attitudes towards a political system in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are used as part of the institutional design. It also explores the extent to which attitudes towards AI-democracy associate with populist and technocratic attitudes. To do that we use an innovative measurement of attitudes towards AI-democracy that we incorporated in a panel study conducted in Chile, Spain, and the United States. We thus exploit variation between countries and across time to examine both the consistency of the main associations and speculate about the causal associations between key variables.","Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Democracy, Populism, Comparative Politics","Hugo Marcos-Marne","Hugo Marcos-Marne","University of Salamanca","Homero Gil de Zuñiga","University of Salamanca; Penn State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Salamanca","Penn State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1342_1597_1522.html","Navigating uncertainty: The impact of moving out on populist attitudes.","Despite increasing interest in populism across Western Countries, there is limited research examining long-term individual factors influencing changes in populist attitudes over time. Existing longitudinal analyses of populist attitudes have shown inconsistent findings regarding variability and stability. Age has been cited as an influencing factor, showing that younger individuals are more prone to populist attitudes, and older individuals remain less affected and also, research has overlooked the role of life transitions in shaping populist attitudes. This paper addresses this gap by examining how life transitions—defined as discrete, time-bounded changes in life status with potentially long-term consequences (George, 1993)—affect populist attitudes. Previous studies have explored economic aspects of life transitions but have not adopted dynamic, longitudinal approaches (Kriesi & Pappas, 2015; Zagórski et al., 2021). To advance understanding, this study focuses on specific life transitions related to living arrangements, such as emancipation, returning to the parental home, living alone, and separation from a partner. Using panel data from Spain (2014–2024), this paper employs fixed-effect linear regression models to analyse the influence of life transitions on populist attitudes. Findings reveal that transitioning to living alone has a more substantial effect on populist attitudes than other transitions, such as emancipation or cohabitation with a partner. This research introduces a novel theoretical framework, emphasising the dynamic impact of life transitions on populist attitudes, thereby offering new insights into individual-level changes over time. By bridging the gap between populism and life-course research, this study highlights the importance of living arrangements in understanding populist trends.","Keywords: populism, life transitions, longitudinal analysis.","María Ruiz Hernández","María Ruiz Hernández",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1343_1974_0086.html","Democracy's Unsolved Dilemma: Education and Increasing Turnout Inequality","Turnout inequality is on the rise in most advanced democracies. Even though education is a key determinant of individual voter turnout, its macro-level expansion has not led to an increase and equalisation of turnout, but the opposite. This paper addresses this puzzle by examining the role of educational expansion –tertiary education in particular– in widening the turnout gap in post-industrial democracies. Drawing on the relative education model, I argue that status anxiety emerges for those without tertiary education in societies where average education attainment keeps increasing. This is not a story of relative deprivation, which can mobilise political participation. Instead, status anxiety diminishes internal political efficacy, demobilising non-tertiary-educated citizens and exacerbating turnout inequality. Using a database comprising 15 Western democracies over 60 years (1964-2024), I show that turnout inequality has increased over time due to a sharper decline in turnout among citizens without higher education. Multilevel interactive models reveal that rising average education levels strengthen the association between individual education and voter turnout, indicating a widening turnout gap. Moreover, I confirm the expectation that non-tertiary-educated individuals increasingly withdraw from voting as the proportion of tertiary-educated citizens grows. Potential compositional effects arising from self-selection into education are addressed through additional robustness checks. This paper advances not only the study of turnout inequality but also the broader field of electoral participation, emphasising the importance of considering structural factors and their consequences for social hierarchies when explaining longitudinal trends in political participation.","Keywords: turnout inequality, relative education, social hierarchy, status anxiety","Berta Caihuelas Navajas","Berta Caihuelas Navajas",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, few studies have provided systematic insights into this new dimension of war, where everyone with an internet connection—whether within or outside the warzone—is now a potential online warrior. How does war in this ""new dimension"" pan out? And to what extent is this online war fought in response to, or in isolation from, the physical battlefield? In this paper, I study how online contentious dynamics respond to conflict on the ground by estimating the effect of conflict intensity on the likelihood of engaging in uncivil communication on Reddit. I draw on three full archives of posts from war-related, English-language, member-heavy subreddits (r/IsraelPalestine, r/syriancivilwar, and r/UkrainianConflict) to study contentious dynamics online. Comments and posts are classified according to their support for conflict parties and their degree of (in)civility, using supervised machine learning. Using conflict event data from a variety of sources that track daily casualties, the location of strikes, and the affiliation of their victims, I estimate the relationship between conflict intensity and online incivility in war-related subreddits. The findings contribute to our understanding of the transnational democratic potential of digital war discussions through their (lack of) alignment with the ideals of deliberative democracy while highlighting a potential transnational cause of political polarization.","Keywords: [digital war, online incivility, conflict intensity]","Emilie Truelsen","Emilie Truelsen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"PhD Candidate at Hertie School",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1345_0743_0385.html","How Memorialization of Conflict Alters the Legacies of Violence","The conventional view in the literature on the legacies of violence holds that the original experience of violence has a direct effect on victims and their descendants. We problematize this view, noting that political entrepreneurs seek to alter the legacy of violence by manipulating historical memory.  To test whether such manipulation alters the legacies of violence we study a natural experiment in the Spanish Civil War whereby the assignment of violence was orthogonal to the political characteristics of affected settlements. Leveraging the data on actual violence during the civil war, an original dataset on historical memorials, panel data on municipal-level voting, as well as an original survey, we ask whether (i) the pattern of memorialization faithfully reflects the experience of violence, and (ii) whether present-day voting behavior is primarily a legacy of the original experience of violence or of the subsequent policy of memorialization.  We find that memorials are not more likely to be constructed in communities that experienced more violence, but rather that political parties that are most likely to benefit from the presence of memorials are ones that are more likely to build them. And, indeed, we show that these parties reap electoral rewards from such memorialization policies. All in all, we demonstrate that contemporary political behavior is often a product of memorialization, which is highly politicized, rather than of the original experience of violence. These findings suggest an important corrective in the field of legacy studies.","Keywords: legacies of violence; memorials; historical memory; civil war; Spanish Civil War; Spain; Catalonia","Leonid Peisakhin","Joan Barceló","NYU Abu Dhabi"," Leonid Peisakhin","NYU Abu Dhabi","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"NYU Abu Dhabi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1346_2625_0691.html","Fragmented Identities, Contradictory Choices and Voting","Societies have grown increasingly complex, and individuals’ political identities have become more fragmented. Voters often no longer embrace the entirety of a party’s values and positions; instead, they find themselves agreeing with some points while rejecting others. Social theory has emphasized for a long time the rise of the “fragmented subject” (Reckwitz 2010). Such fragmentation may profoundly reshape political representation, as growing segments of the electorate feel only partially represented by existing parties. The democracies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where voters’ attachments to parties are generally less stable, offer a particularly revealing context. In this article, we focus on the case of Slovakia. Using data from the Volebný Kompas voting advice application (VAA) for the 2023 snap Slovak Parliamentary Elections and a post-election follow-up survey of VAA respondents (N=8,535), we examine how voters navigate fragmented political identities. Employing panel data and an embedded experiment, we investigate how the act of voting reshapes issue salience and policy stances as voters adjust their priorities to align with the parties they settle on. We show how voters construct their political identity following the issues raised by political contenders (or not) – and how possible deviations, paradoxes, and contradictions from or with these patterns are ultimately reconciled. With this work, we aim to contribute to the literature on political representation and deepen our understanding of how voters’ identities evolve through the voting process, offering insights into how party systems might better address these emerging complexities.","Keywords: Fragmented Political Identities, Central and Eastern Europe, Voting Behavior","Jozef Michal Mintal","Jozef Michal Mintal","Matej Bel University","Bence Hamrak","Central European University","Felix Butzlaff","Central European University","Robert Vancel","Matej Bel University","Kamila Borsekova","Matej Bel University","","","","","","","","","","","Matej Bel University","Central European University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1347_2237_0698.html","Policy Alternatives and Political Leadership","Democratic theory suggests that we should want politicians to take their policy instructions from citizens.  However, this conception of democracy is challenged by evidence that voters are not knowledgeable about policy, that voters are short-sighted, and that voters do not hold anything like crystallized policy positions on most issues. This has led to an expansion of the concept of a healthy democracy to one in which politicians may “get out in front of” voters to achieve the politician’s preferred policy, while not subjecting themselves to electoral risk (Jacobs 2000; Canes-Wrone, Herron, and Shotts 2001).       I add to these prior explanations. Under my account, a President making an unpopular policy choice can obtain their preferred policy outcome and avoid electoral calamity, even if voters do not change their ideal policy outcome before or after the President takes action. This is possible, I argue, because shifting the status quo may alter voters’ perceptions about the set of viable policy alternatives.    A key empirical implication of my theory is that voters’ acceptance of policy changes they disfavor will depend on their perceptions of the likely alternative to that outcome (if any). In spring 2025, I will field a panel survey to track voter reactions to the initiatives rolled out by the incoming presidential administration. Voters will be interviewed to gauge their approval of proposed new initiatives, reinterviewed to observe any over-time change in policy approval, and asked to share their beliefs about what they perceive to be the alternatives to the new policies.","Keywords: leadership, voting behavior, representation","John Griffin","John Griffin",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Georgetown University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While national identity explains general opposition to supranational institutions, support for integration varies more among policy domains than among individuals. The lack of a comprehensive theory to explain this variation limits our understanding of how coalitions for cooperation can be formed. This study posits that citizens favor transferring policies to the supranational level when they believe these policies will more closely align with their preferences compared to domestic alternatives. This hypothesis is tested through three empirical investigations focusing on policy-specific support for European integration. The first study, based on data from the 2002 European Social Survey combined with party manifestos, finds that individuals demonstrate lower policy congruence with their national governments on issues they prefer to transfer to a supranational level. The second study analyses Eurobarometer data (1989-2011) combined with a novel automated coding of the ideological orientation of EU policies, and shows that support for supranational governance is higher in areas where the EU's outputs align more closely with individual ideological stances. The third study uses a survey experiment in four countries to confirm a causal interpretation of the previous findings. These results highlight the multi-layered process through which citizens seek representation and suggest that institutional preferences are partly endogenous to policy preferences.

The objective of this paper is to develop an analytic framework of narratives of finance by leveraging computationally assisted text analysis and qualitative content analysis across two corpora, each consisting of English-language texts on FinTech collected automatically from various online sources. The first consists of statements, speeches and press-statements from country representatives in finance-related international institutions and forums such as the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, and the BRICS+ summits. The second consists of a global sample of news articles with fintech-related keywords from English-language news sources. The central hypothesis is that narratives of fintech broadly overlap with narratives regarding the (US-led) international financial system, categorizing it as a zero-sum or positive-sum game. The analysis is performed in two stages. The first tests whether unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g. structural topic models) can uncover coherent latent themes in the corpora which correspond with this dichotomy and if the prevalence of such topics correlates coded attitudes of actors towards the international financial system. In the second stage, a small sample of representative documents from both corpora is selected and subjected to in-depth qualitative content analysis. Initial results show that is positive-sum views conceptually emphasize terms that highlight individual agency whereas zero-sum views emphasize structural constraints.","Keywords: fintech, automated text analysis,  mixed methods","Alfredo Hernandez Sanchez","Alfredo Hernandez Sanchez",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vilnius University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How the radical-right affects parliamentary discourse on climate change","Radical-right political actors have the potential to influence and polarize political discourse, posing challenges to democratic consensus-building on critical issues such as climate change. In the context of an accelerating climate crisis, effective climate action requires both democratic majorities and broad public support – conditions that polarization can undermine. This article investigates the impact of radical-right politicians, often the most climate-skeptical voices, on parliamentary debates on climate change. Employing a novel supervised learning approach, I identify climate-related content in parliamentary speeches and, using established multilingual transformer models, analyze the emotions and moral appeals embedded within these speeches. This approach allows me to provide empirical evidence on the radical right’s potential to shape the political discourse on climate change across multiple national European parliaments and to shed light on the divide between radical right and green parties – representing the strongest advocates in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, I leverage the staggered entry of a radical-right party into German state parliament to make the findings more robust.","Keywords: Climate change, parliamentary speeches, party competition, radical-right parties, text analysis","David Schweizer","David Schweizer",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper shows that subjective polarization is related to the fate of authoritarian successor parties in democracy. Using a new dataset comprising 2 million voters' perceptions of 1000 political parties in several new democratic countries, I show that authoritarian successor parties are consistently perceived as more extreme on the left-right dimension from what their policy positions are. Further analyses show that parties led by a former authoritarian elite or the children of a former authoritarian elite have an extremism premium. This is robust when using expert placements, party manifestos, and comparisons within the same party family. A regression discontinuity analysis shows that this bias is stronger for those eligible to vote in the first democratic elections and saw the party operating during both regimes. Last, I study the Brazilian case, where several authoritarian politicians ended up in different political parties, to show that voters from the constituency where they were chosen during the dictatorship have a more biased perception of these political parties. The findings have relevant consequences in understanding polarization in countries with authoritarian pasts.","Keywords: Transitions to Democracy; Elites; Party Perceptions; Authoritarian Parties","Javier Padilla","Javier Padilla",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"City University of New York",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1352_2623_1053.html","How Clientelism Closes the Gender Turnout Gap: Theory and Evidence from India","When do women and men participate equally in the electoral process? I argue that besides the traditional, resource-based explanations of women’s participation, there is an alternative path to women’s equal electoral participation that depends on clientelist mobilization of household support for female turnout. Where households are supportive of women’s participation, they can bridge the resource gap to enable female turnout even in the most unlikely of contexts, namely where women face a lack of resources and high costs to participation in public life. But households will only be supportive were returns toa vote are high. I develop a typology of clientelist regimes that posits that both the sequencing of the clientelist exchange as well as the source of the clientelist resources determines the value of a vote. Returns to a vote should be highest when clientelist parties rely on post-election resource sharing arrangements that provide selective post-election access to state resources; and lowest when clientelist parties instead bank on privately funded electoral handouts. I test this theory in India, a particularly puzzling case of gender turnout parity, using a novel panel data set on the number of ethnic groups targeted by clientelist parties from 1977 through 2007. I show that a) the number of ethnic groups incorporated went up over time, and that b) a rise in the number of politically incorporated ethnic groups before an election leads to a drop in the gender turnout gap during the election at the constituency level.","Keywords: Gender, Political Participation, India, Ethnicity, Clientelism","Franziska Roscher","Franziska Roscher",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Georgia Institute of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1353_1794_1452.html","Seasonal Variation and the Misperception of Climate Change Impacts","How people perceive (or misperceive) trends influences their political attitudes (e.g., Bartels, 2008). In particular, processing time series on climate change is a challenging task: cognitive biases often lead to misinterpretation of climate trends and, consequently, to a lower willingness to take action against global warming (for a review, see Hardy & Jamieson, 2017). In this paper, we build on peak-end-rule theory (e.g., Kahneman et al., 1993) and the literature on endpoint bias (e.g., Jamieson & Hardy, 2014). We investigate what we define as cyclic variation bias, that is, the misperception of an underlying trend due to regular oscillations around that trend.In a pre-registered between-subjects experiment included in a probabilistic survey in the city of Berlin (N = 1,833), we exposed participants to a simulated yet highly realistic visualization of declining water levels in a large Berlin lake. All experimental groups were exposed to exactly the same trend, but we manipulated the time window to vary the season at the end of the graph and the number of years shown. Varying the cyclic phase (i.e., the visualization of seasons) in the graph had a significant effect on participants' perception of the trend. This effect was attenuated when participants were exposed to a three-year instead of a two-year time series. Exposure to seasonal variation also correlated with support for climate action, although this effect did not reach statistical significance. We discuss the implications of the cyclic variation bias for communication about climate change and other politically relevant phenomena.","Keywords: climate change communication, cognitive biases, trend perception,  political attitudes, survey experiment","Philippe Joly","Philippe Joly","Otto Suhr Institute of Political Science, Freie Universität Berlin","Lena Masch","Institute for Political Science, University of Münster","Thorsten Faas","Otto Suhr Institute of Political Science, Freie Universität Berlin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Otto Suhr Institute of Political Science, Freie Universität Berlin","Institute for Political Science, University of Münster",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1354_1324_1453.html","Who are the “defenders of democracy”: Political elites or citizens?","A growing set of survey and experimental studies in recent years have examined whether the support for democracy is eroding in established democracies, but this research has almost exclusively focused on the attitudes of citizens (Graham and Svolik, 2020; Wuttke et al., 2022). Yet, political elites are often considered even more crucial ‘gatekeepers’ of democracy than ordinary citizens (Linz and Stepan, 1978; O’Donnell and Schmitter, 1986; Levitsky & Ziblatt, 2019; Peffley & Rohrschneider, 2009). Our paper builds on the classic literature that has contrasted democratic attitudes between politicians and ordinary citizens in established democracies (Stouffer, 1955). While older literature has generally suggested that politicians should display a higher commitment to democratic norms than ordinary citizens by virtue of their socialization to pro-regime norms, more recent studies have questioned these assumptions and suggested that elites’ commitment to democratic principles may be heterogeneous and context dependent (Peffley & Rohrschneider, 2009; Shamir, 1991; Sniderman et al., 1996). Our study provides novel evidence on these questions by comparing the extent of commitment to democratic principles both among politicians and citizens using survey data from a unique, nationally representative panel of local and regional-level politicians (n=1,100) as well as a nationally-representative citizen panel (n=6,000) in Finland. Our surveys measured politicians’ and citizens’ commitment to specific democratic institutions and democratic checks and balances using a question battery developed by Claassen et al. (2024). Our paper therefore provides new evidence on the robustness of the commitment to democratic institutions both among political elites and citizens in established democracies.","Keywords: Democracy, democratic support, political elites, citizens, survey research","Inga Saikkonen","Inga Saikkonen","Åbo Akademi University, Finland"," Lauri Rapeli","Åbo Akademi University, Finland"," Anton Brännlund","Åbo Akademi University, Finland","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Åbo Akademi University, Finland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a large survey experiment in the United States and Germany, with 5,000 respondents each, to explore how citizens would design their ideal governance system. We focus on two scenarios: a path-dependent scenario (the respondent's country; Earth) and a utopian 'blank slate' scenario (Mars). This comparison allows us to assess how citizens' preferences change when removed from the constraints of their current governance system, and provides a unique perspective for re-imagining future governance systems. To analyze citizens' governance preferences in these two scenarios, we use advanced survey techniques: a constant sum approach to capture general preferences for (mixed) governance systems (ranging from representative and participatory to expertocratic and assertive leadership models) and a conjoint experiment to examine issue-dependent preferences for decision making. Our preliminary results show that citizens in both contexts favor the involvement of multiple actors. On Earth, they largely adhere to representative systems with expert and participatory add-ons. On Mars, however, they show greater openness to ""multi-cameral"" governance, where different institutions (e.g., representative, direct-democratic, lottocratic, expertocratic) share decision-making responsibilities, echoing historical models such as ancient Athens.","Keywords: Democracy, Experiment, Process Preferences, Comparative","Vanessa Schwaiger","Vanessa Schwaiger","University of Stuttgart"," Anja Rieker","University of Stuttgart"," Franziska Maier","University of Stuttgart"," André Bächtiger","University of Stuttgart","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Stuttgart",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis focuses on three groups over time - women, immigrants, and investors -each associated with distinct media narratives and policy contexts. Regression models test the impact of media coverage on policy outputs while controlling for public opinion trends, economic indicators, and political context.

Some scholars argue that we are observing a pattern of dealignment (e.g., Garzia et al. 2022). Others argue that we are are in the middle of a process of realignment.(e.g., Bornschier et al. 2024). Much of the evidence to date stems from an analysis of vote choice. We broaden the perspective by focusing on electoral consideration sets. From a consideration set perspective, final vote choices are only the final stage in a decision chain that voters undertake. An important preceding stage concerns the parties that voters seriously consider as contenders of their voter. From this perspective, the question becomes how dealignment and realignment affect consideration set size and composition. Under dealignment, we would expect large, heterogeneous consideration sets that display little internal structure and instability throughout a campaign. Under realignment, the consideration sets should be smaller, structured, and more stable in the short term. We test these hypotheses using data from the online panel of the British election study. This panel allows us to study short-term dynamics within individuals, as well as longer term trends across individuals. In this way, the paper contributes to our understanding of electoral dynamics.","Keywords: dealignment; realignment; Britain; consideration sets","Marco Steenbergen","Marco Steenbergen","University of Zurich","David Attewell","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Zurich","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, we examine how representatives adjust their priorities in response to disasters, considering factors such as party affiliation, geographic proximity to the events, and the severity of the disaster’s impact. Preliminary findings indicate that representatives from disaster-affected regions frequently redirect their focus to disaster-related issues, while broader response patterns are shaped by partisan and institutional contexts. Moreover, the sentiment of speeches often reflects heightened urgency, empathy, and calls for action following disaster declarations.This research contributes to the understanding of political communication and the responsiveness of democratic institutions to crises. By exploring how natural disasters influence legislative behavior and priorities, we offer insights into the adaptability of Congress in addressing emergent challenges.

Prior research offers conflicting findings on whether climate change related weather events have the potential to influence environmental attitudes and behaviours. I theorize that these discrepancies arise from differences in individuals' climate change risk perceptions depending on whether they perceive their exposure to natural disasters as temporary or systemic. Using panel and cross-sectional data from the German Longitudinal Electoral Study (GLES) and the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, this study employs mixed-effects generalized linear models to estimate the impact of disaster exposure across varying time frames.  The results indicate that, while natural disasters generally increase the salience of environmental issues, the effect of long-term systemic exposure differs from short-term temporary exposure. Specifically, persistent exposure over extended periods leads voters to prioritize addressing climate change over economic growth. Conversely, short-term exposure shifts preferences toward economic growth, reflecting a difference in perceived costs associated with systemic versus temporary exposure to natural disasters. This study advances our understanding of how natural disaster exposure influences political attitudes by introducing a novel framework to differentiate between short- and long-term risk patterns. It sheds light on the role of temporary and systemic exposure to climate change-related events on environmental policy preferences, contributing to theoretical and methodological debates in political psychology and environmental studies.","Keywords: environmental attitudes, climate change, natural disasters, risk perceptions, political psychology","Malena Ullrich","Malena Ullrich",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1363_1653_1457.html","Two sides of the same coin? Welfare state dimensions and support for democracy.","Scholars have underscored the relevance of institutional performance for the legitimacy of democratic regimes. In particular, the welfare state is a key performance indicator that affects citizens’ economic and social well-being. Yet, this relationship has only been addressed through single policies, without considering the complexity of the welfare state. In this sense, this paper uses a multidimensional approach to account for the effect of different welfare dimensions on support for democracy. Combining aggregate data from the Luxembourg Income Study with individual data from the Integrated Value Survey, this paper demonstrates that high levels of universalism and low-income targeting concentration positively affect individual support for democracy. Due to the formative effects of the welfare state on policy preferences and expectations, I argue that both types of welfare designs can create a sense of care and protection that increases support for democracy through different mechanisms. Whereas low-income targeting designs fulfil citizens' expectations through the assistance of the needy, universalistic welfare regimes do this by promoting equal treatment and a sense of egalitarianism across citizens. This paper contributes to the literature on institutional performance and support for democracy by challenging the classic views of the welfare state and promoting an innovative framework to understand how different welfare designs may lead to similar outcomes.","Keywords: Support for democracy, welfare dimensions, transfer share, universalism, low-income targeting","Miguel Marfil de la Torre","Miguel Marfil de la Torre",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"UC3M",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1364_0999_1460.html","Who's left, who's right? Examining cross-national variations in the use of the left-right scale with anchoring vignettes","The left-right ideological position of individuals is a key variable in political science, often used to ease the complexities of political preferences into a single dimension. Despite its widespread use, the single-item left-right scale has faced criticism for failing to capture the nuanced perceptions of respondents and for being susceptible to differential item functioning (DIF), where individuals interpret scale points differently across various contexts. This study investigates the comparability of the left-right scale across 30 European countries using the anchoring vignette approach. Data comes from large, nationally representative samples (N=30,000) collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews. Our findings reveal significant variations in the interpretation of the left-right ideological scale. The ordering, the mean placements of the vignettes and the average distance between vignette placements all varied significantly between countries, indicating substantial cross-national differences in the interpretation of ideological positions. The findings suggest that the left-right concept is not perceived in the same way across Europe. Based on these cautionary results we argue that researchers employing a single-item left-right scale to gauge ideological positions in comparative analyses in Europe should consider implementing corrections for measurement invariance or acknowledge the possibility of varying interpretations.","Keywords: anchoring vignette, left-right scale, measurement invariance, political ideology","Dömötör Gere, Dávid Kollár, Ádám Stefkovics","Dömötör Gere","Századvég Foundation, Budapest, Hungary","Dávid Kollár","Századvég Foundation, Budapest, Hungary; Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary; Budapest Metropolitan University, Budapest, Hungary; University of Pécs - Applied Ontology Research Group, Pécs, Hungary","Ádám Stefkovics","Századvég Foundation, Budapest, Hungary; HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences, Budapest, Hungary; Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences, Harvard University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Századvég Foundation, Budapest, Hungary","HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences, Budapest, Hungary","Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences, Harvard University","Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary","Budapest Metropolitan University, Budapest, Hungary","University of Pécs - Applied Ontology Research Group, Pécs, Hungary",NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1365_1913_1467.html","Do citizens think digitalisation is a new important political issue? Examining digitalisation attitudes through Eurobarometer data","Many political and economic discourses posit digitalisation as an important societal issue. Digitalisation has many political implications, as its effects permeate different areas of citizens’ lives. Policy initiatives at the EU level underline the amount of political attention dedicated to this topic. It is less clear what EU citizens think of this issue, and which factors drive their attitudes. This question remains unanswered for two reasons: 1) Existing research largely focuses on specific policies and domains rather than on the cross-cutting ensemble of digitalisation, and 2) many datasets do not link citizens' digitalisation attitudes with political aspects. Through Eurobarometer data, this project analyses citizens’ preferences regarding digitalisation and their attitudes on which level of government should tackle digitalisation.This research is informed by a previous analysis which investigated the politicisation of digitalisation in party discourse at the national and EU level, to map both supply and demand-side factors on digitalisation as a political issue. This proposed research allows comparative insights into the characteristics and issue preferences of those who identify digitalisation as an important political issue. Together, the findings shed light on whether digitalisation is being politicised at all, and whether the arena of politicisation is at the national or European level. The results will provide insights into public opinion on digitalisation in the political realm, which has been scant in the academic literature but has important democratic implications. Understanding citizens’ perceptions of an emerging issue can avoid potential democratic shortcomings, such as a lack of responsiveness or increasing polarisation.","Keywords: Digitalisation; European Politics; Issue Competition; Politicisation; Public Opinion","Licinia Güttel","Licinia Güttel",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1366_1763_1521.html","Regional Inequality and Support for Place-Based Policies","Regional inequalities within countries have become increasingly relevant for understanding contemporary economic conditions and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. In response, place-based policies are increasingly seen as a potential solution to address both economic and environmental challenges simultaneously, but potentially risk backlash due to the distributional consequences they entail. This study examines how individuals' preferences for place-based climate and social policies are influenced by awareness of these inequalities and policy design features. Our research design allows us to isolate the effects of information about regional disparities on policy preferences, while also identifying the relative importance of various policy attributes. To do so, we use a combination of an information provision and conjoint experiment in a representative survey of UK residents (N = 1,999, fielded in May 2024) to examine how individuals' preferences for place-based climate and social policies are shaped by regional climate and economic inequalities and their design. The results find that while individuals' have distinct preferences, cost and funding considerations play a predominant role. We also find that economic concerns broadly outweigh concerns about climate change, both in the targeting of policy and regional variation in demands for intervention. Our results have implications for understanding the development of regional policies to facilitate the green transition and its economic consequences. First, the results emphasise the importance of policy design over communication-based strategies to boost policy engagement, such as framing. Finally, our results provide necessary detail to debates surrounding the combination of climate and social policy goals.","Keywords: Place-based policy, regional inequality, green transition, social policy, public opinion","Muzhou Zhang","Liam Beiser-McGrath","London School of Economic and Political Science","Sophia Stutzmann","Universität Konstanz","Muzhou Zhang","Aarhus University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London School of Economic and Political Science","Universität Konstanz","Aarhus University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1367_1719_0392.html","Comparision of Middle Power's Normalization Processes of Weapons","How do states normalize the existence and usage of weapon systems, and what explains the variations among those processes? This study investigates middle powers’ normalization processes of weapon systems, related to their pursuit of status in the international order. Previous studies have struggled to explain the variations in these processes’ scope and objectives. This study emphasizes how the technical and normative characteristics of each weapon system, whether those qualify as 'superweapon’, affect middle powers' strategic frameworks—whether they adopt a governmental/national or supranational approach to normalizing the existence and usage of these weapons. The research sheds light on how middle powers approach the technological constructive power of weapon systems may contribute to peace. To substantiate this argument, the study conducts a comparative analysis of the normalization processes of nuclear weapons, lethal autonomous weapon systems, anti-personnel mines, and cluster munitions. Specifically, the research examines the Wellington Process (1985) for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific, the Hague Process (2023) on responsible AI in the military domain, the Ottawa Process (1997) for anti-personnel mine ban normalization, and the Oslo Process (2007) for cluster munitions ban normalization. These cases illustrate how middle powers are influenced by the technological constructive power of weapon systems—whether they are considered superweapons or not—in constructing strategic frameworks to normalize these systems. This study contributes by elucidating how middle powers' pursuit of status and their perceptions relate to their behavior. For policymakers, this research serves as a primer on explaining and predicting middle powers' approaches to further developments.","Keywords: superweapons, middle powers, nuclear power, LAWS, anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, normalization, peace","Hyunsu Kim","Hyunsu Kim","Seoul National University"," Jonghyuk Chung","Seoul National University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Seoul National University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1369_1835_0702.html","Compensational strategic voting in times of viable populist radical right parties","The surge of populist radical right parties in Europe and beyond has forced political scientists to reconsider their voting model and theories. In this paper, we explore how this has changed patterns of strategic voting. We assume that voters form expectations of government outcomes.  Our argument is that the accommodating strategy of mainstream parties toward populist radical right parties increased their viability as government parties, and therefore modified the strategic incentives of some voters. First, some should in theory defect from their first preference in a leftist direction to compensate for the anticipated influence of the populist radical right in a right-wing coalition. Second, others should come back to their first preference, as the radical right does not constitute a protest party without any prospects of governing any more. To test these hypotheses, we leverage cross-country survey data from  the CSES, and survey panel data from Sweden where the centre-right parties in 2019 lifted the cordon sanitaire around the Sweden Democrats. This created a shock in the survey that can be used to identify the relationship between governmental viability of the populist radical right party and centre-right voters’ vote intentions.","Keywords: strategic, voting, populist right, compensation","Annika Fredén","Annika Fredén","Lund University","Damien Bol","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lund University","Sciences Po",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The variety of approaches used for forecasting – citizen forecasting, political-economy models, poll-based models, electronic markets, and machine learning - present us with the opportunity to assess forecasting accuracy, lessons learned, and avenues for future research. While vote intention polls and the media underestimated Trump’s performance and pointed to a very tight election, the state-level Electoral College vote forecasting models performed quite well.  In particular, the Enns et al. (2024) state-level political economy model provided an accurate Electoral College forecast of 226 for Harris and 312 for Trump.  Additionally, Mongrain and Stegmaier (2024) took the five state-level forecasts in the special issue and averaged them on a state-by-state basis, which also resulted in an accurate 226-312 Electoral College vote prediction.

While conventional theories of nation-building emphasize macro-level factors such as wars, this study focuses on intellectual elites as key agents in constructing narratives of national identity. Rather than passively responding to external threats, intellectuals actively engage in framing cohesive national identities. We argue that war strengthens these efforts by fostering closer elite networks, which amplify their capacity to influence collective identity formation.We test this theory in the context of imperial China during its transition from empire to nation-state—a period marked by external threats and internal upheaval. Chinese intellectuals, facing challenges to sovereignty, sought to adapt the Western and Japanese concept of the nation-state to China’s cultural and historical circumstances. Using a dataset of all Chinese-language journals published from 1860-1911, we trace how these intellectuals articulated visions of national identity in response to crises. This article contributes to the literature on nation-building by emphasizing the agency of intellectual elites, particularly in non-Western contexts.","Keywords: state building, nation-building, political elites, China, intellectuals","Peng Peng","Peng Peng",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Washington University in St. Louis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building upon social identity theory, we argue that the strength of binary gender identity (the importance individuals place on being a woman or man for their sense of self) is a crucial determinant of the degree to which one perceives LGBTQ individuals as out-groups, fostering prejudice. To test this, we first conduct a nationally representative survey in the United States (N = 1,013). We find that higher binary gender identity strength (BGIS) is associated with significantly lower LGBTQ tolerance, an effect that, while cutting across ideological lines, is primarily driven by men. We then conduct two large-scale experiments (N = 4,268 in total) with nationally representative samples and distinct designs, demonstrating that while BGIS causally affects tolerance for both women and men, predictably manipulating BGIS is difficult. Our study highlights binary gender identity as a potential source of LGBTQ prejudice, while also underscoring the challenges in developing prejudice-reducing interventions.","Keywords: Gender Identity, LGBTQ Tolerance, Social Identity Theory, Public Opinion","Tony Zirui Yang","Tony Zirui Yang","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Margit Tavits","Washington University in St. Louis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Nuffield College, University of Oxford","Washington University in St. Louis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1374_0953_1472.html","Support for the welfare state: trade-offs between social citizenship and political rights","How strong is citizens' support for the welfare state and what are the limits? Arguments about welfare chauvinism and deservingness suggest that support for the welfare state is not universal. Some citizens hold the view that individuals perceived as undeserving, e.g., immigrants or long-term unemployed, should be excluded from the welfare state. The perception of undeservingness is often rooted in the notion that these individuals do not contribute to the system or violate societal norms. One potential further consequence would be to restrict the political rights of these groups. We argue that citizens are willing to support such restrictions, depending on the targeted group. We employ an original survey experiment conducted among the German population (N=6000). In the experiment, citizens are confronted with the trade-off between a strong welfare state and the restriction of rights for individuals who might not contribute to society (immigrants, long-term unemployed, and fellow German citizens). This study enhances our understanding of the factors influencing citizens' support for the welfare state. By bringing together the literature on deservingness and support for citizens' rights, we show how these two dimensions are evaluated and weighted by citizens.","Keywords: welfare state, trade-off, political rights, survey experiment","Felix Jäger","Marius Busemeyer","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","Felix Jäger","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","Philip Rathgeb","University of Edinburgh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz, Cluster of Excellence 'The Politics of Inequality'","University of Edinburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1375_1065_1473.html","Capital cities in the eye of the storm: Unpacking rural-urban, centre-periphery, and economic divides","The rise of big cities highlights their growing role as key actors in the globalised world. This is especially the case for capitals, which amass more resources and power in contrast to rural, peripheral, and declining areas. Place as a politically divisive element is receiving increasing attention and numerous studies address the phenomenon of left-behind areas. This paper explores a complementary but understudied aspect: the negative feelings towards the capitals, the places that do matter, among these lagging areas’ inhabitants. Despite growing research on the topic, it is still necessary to clarify how different explanations ‒the rural-urban, the centre-periphery, and economic divides‒ relate to these negative feelings. The objective of this article is, therefore, to shed light on the influence of each of these factors. Using Spain as a case study, this paper investigates these dynamics in a country marked by stark rural-urban demographic imbalances and a political landscape shaped by centre-periphery debates. The analysis leverages unique geocoded survey data collected in 2022 to examine feelings at both national and regional levels, focusing on perceptions of national and regional capitals. Preliminary findings indicate that geographic distance to the capital is the most significant factor driving negative feelings, while the roles of rurality and unemployment appear more nuanced. These findings help clarify the complexity of geographic divides, providing crucial insights into the nature of these tensions and their implications for political cohesion and policy intervention.","Keywords: rural-urban, centre-periphery, capital cities","Rubén García del Horno","Rubén García del Horno",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, we establish a set of new descriptive facts on the involvement of police unions in funding local elections.

This paper explores the dynamics of cultural transmission and minority identity preservation amid nation-building efforts, combining theoretical modeling with a historical case study analysis of Turkish Kurdistan. I analyze the competing forces between parental socialization within minority groups and state-driven efforts to homogenize the population. The state, aiming to promote national unity, employs various strategies---from language prohibition to massacres and genocide---that challenge the transmission of minority traits. Simultaneously, minority parents invest in transmitting their cultural identity to future generations. My model examines how these interactions shape the cultural landscape, leading to either cultural diversity or homogenization. My model demonstrates that even if there are no representatives of the cultural majority trait initially present in the population, the nation-building effort is sufficient to shift the system toward a non-degenerate distribution. It also demonstrates that this effort is not sufficient to fully homogenize the population. The cultural minority can increase its effort to preserve its distinctiveness, thereby resisting the nation-building effort. Drawing on historical evidence from Turkish Kurdistan, I demonstrate how the Kurdish population not only resisted the nation-building efforts of a repressive authoritarian state but also mobilized en masse in the struggle for cultural and political autonomy. I argue that Kurdish cultural elements transmitted through endogenous community effort were instrumental in preserving Kurdish identity and shaping minority responses to assimilation policies.","Keywords: Cultural transmission, assimilation, nation-building.","Kirill Chmel","Kirill Chmel",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Columbia University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of these emigrants live in the United States. A growing literature explores the political implications of emigration and remittances for political behavior. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of changes in the opportunity environment outside of one’s country on individuals’ demands vis-à-vis their government at home. Does losing access to foreign labor markets or monetary assistance coming from abroad shape citizens’ commitment to democracy, demands from the government, and willingness to hold domestic elites accountable for their actions? To answer these questions, we employ a two-step empirical strategy that combines a regression discontinuity design and an original survey experiment in Mexico. First, we leverage a natural experiment whereby the timing of the 2016 US presidential election coincided with the fieldwork for the AmericasBarometer (LAPOP) survey in several Latin American countries. We argue that Trump’s victory might have changed respondents’ perceptions about the feasibility of moving to the United States for work or relying on remittances from family members residing in the United States, which might have increased the salience of the quality of democracy in their home country. We then propose an original survey experiment that oversamples households living in municipalities with the highest levels of emigration to the United States.

Both the European Union and the USA are now prioritizing security over democracy in foreign affairs. The EU’s Foreign and Security Policy increasingly supports moving in the direction of securitization and the commitment to values-based soft diplomacy has to some extent been replaced by a move towards hard power. Rising amounts of national and European budgets go to defense, while more and more policy debates address these matters.No matter what their political tendency, across the Atlantic, successive US presidents have tended to prioritize security over democracy. Even though the USA extends foreign aid to countries exhibiting democratic progress, the United States also forms alliances with undemocratic regimes in order to ensure security. Moreover, in recent years US citizens place promoting democracy abroad low on their priority list. Republicans, especially, are unsupportive of any approach that prioritizes democracy in foreign affairs.The increasing securitization of politics and use of militaristic language can be seen as having potential to weaken democratic processes at home and abroad, both in Europe and the US. Linking democratic ideals with military instruments may at times foster ongoing wars for the sake of protecting ‘democracy’.

Especially within the EMU, economic constraints limit governments capacities to implement economic policy programmes, resulting in a tension between responsive and responsible policies. However, few attempts have been made to empirically examine the implications of programmatic constraints fornational voting behaviour. Using a conjoint experiment, this paper analyses how constraints on economic programmatic choice affect electoral behaviour in two EMU countries, Germany and Portugal. Specifically, we posit that while economic issues are generally more relevant to vote choice than non-economic issues, when the ability of parties to implement alternative economic policies is limited, voters resort to other issues. Furthermore, we argue that voters no longer evaluate economic policies solely on the basis of their content, but also on their compliance with European rules. Finally,  we also formulate expectations on how the range of available economic options might influence voter turnout.","Keywords: EMU, economic policies, programmatic constraints, conjoint experiment","Lea Heyne","Lea Heyne","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","Roberto Pannico","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","Rubén Ruiz-Rufino","King’s College London","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","King’s College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Media framing effects on the acceptance of election outcomes by European voters","As politics become more polarised and the spread of misinformation more prevalent, one might ask whether election outcomes in proportional elections are becoming more contested. The media have an important responsibility with respect to the electoral integrity of democratic elections. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to shed light on the extent to which media framing of election outcomes in terms of legitimising or challenging them has consequences for the degree to which voters accept election outcomes. We pre-registered several hypotheses that concern the direct effect of media framing on election outcome acceptance, in such way that legitimising (challenging) frames will have positive (negative) effects. We also expect a mediating effect via the degree to which voters consider certain parties winner or losers of the preceding election, which affect the respective positive and negative effects on election outcome acceptance. Furthermore, we expect that perceived threats of misinformation and perceived electoral integrity will moderate the direct and indirect effects, be they positive or negative. To test our hypotheses, we link data on media coverage following the 2024 European Parliament elections to a three-wave panel survey conducted before and after the elections in three countries, namely the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. The main linking variable is media use, which we employ to weigh the extent to which voters were exposed to legitimising or challenging framing right after the elections.

How are new ideas created, and how do they diffuse? Specifically, how do spatial connections affect the generation and diffusion of ideas? Intuitively, a densernetwork should increase the number of novel ideas and augment their diffusion. I study knowledge production in Germany in the 19th century, relying on several novel large-scale datasets, including the universe of bibliographic records, covering all published texts in all fields of knowledge, and detailed and comprehensive railway statistics. New ideas – both novel concepts and new combinations of existing ideas – are measured thanks to recent advancesin machine learning and topology applied to data analysis. I show that the railroad network increased the creation of new ideas, but decreased their diffusion. This was a by-product of specialization: with the railroad, groups of scholars could focus on narrower topics and co-locate with similar professionals; they learnt more from similar groups, but became disconnected from dissimilar ones. These patterns are those that paved the way for modern knowledge production, and they had important consequences for state institutions, on top of scientific discoveries and growth. Public officials and legislators were trained with narrower but deeper expertise.

"abstract_1384_0698_1057.html","To each their sport: support for trans* inclusion and fair play concerns","Trans* inclusion in sports is a highly debated topic, with policy views cutting across party lines. While minority rights research suggests attitudes towards a minority group are central to framing one's policy view, recent descriptive studies on trans* inclusion in sports suggest resistance might be grounded in fairness concerns, rather than trans* negativity. This research aims to clarify the causal relationship between trans* attitudes, fairness concerns, and policy views. First, through a theoretical framework grounded in sport ethics literature, I argue that fairness concerns are driven by assumptions about trans* individuals' physiology, ideas about the value of sports, and particularities of competitions. Next, this paper argues that different sport competitions produce varying levels of fair play concern which, in turn, influence the relationship between attitudes and support for inclusionary policy. Using an online survey experiment conducted in the US (N = 1218, Mage = 48.42, sd = 16.97) this study finds support for the framework and suggested causal relationship. The results indicate that on average, the public is more willing to support trans* inclusion in low (shooting) vs. high (steeplechase) fair play concern competitions. Crucially, fair play concern moderates relationships between attitudes and support for trans* inclusion, with trans* negative individuals more willing to support trans* inclusion in shooting compared to similarly prejudiced individuals in the steeplechase condition. The results have implications for minority rights literature and trans* policy advocates, suggesting it might be beneficial to address fair play concerns directly in attempts to increase support for trans* inclusion.","Keywords: transgender, inclusion, sports policy, USA","MJ Balezina","MJ Balezina",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Aarhus University, Department of Political Science, CEPDISC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1385_1057_1470.html","Local Exposure to Refugees Differentially Affects Welfare Chauvinism: Causal Evidence From German Panel Data","The impact of the 2015 peak in refugee applications in Europe on immigration attitudes and far right voting is widely studied. However, little is known on how local exposure to refugees affected welfare chauvinism, i.e. the support to exclude immigrants from welfare services. This is the first paper to provide causal evidence on this question. The paper tests preregistered hypotheses derived from intergroup contact and economic and cultural intergroup threat theory using original panel data from Germany (2015/2016/2017, N ≈ 1,500) and administrative data on the allocation of refugees to municipalities. A continuous difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous allocation finds larger refugee immigration to have an overall null effect on welfare chauvinism. However, further analysis reveals substantial treatment heterogeneity: At the individual level, those exposed to more economic threat through refugees and those more likely to perceive refugees as a cultural threat increase in welfare chauvinism if exposed to more refugees. At the municipal level, pre-existing ethnic diversity protects against increases in welfare chauvinism, whereas worse economic conditions and a more anti-immigrant political climate contribute to increased welfare chauvinism with larger refugee immigration. Taken together, the results suggest that in Germany, economic and cultural threat perceptions outweighed intergroup contact in certain municipalities. This raises concerns about the exclusion of immigrants from welfare services in the face of increasing ethnic diversity, and may have policy implications in determining the distribution of refugees.","Keywords: causal inference, ethnic diversity, welfare chauvinism, refugees, Germany","Jakob Eicheler","Jakob Eicheler",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Universität Duisburg-Essen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While there is an increasing body of research comparing municipalities within countries at the meso level, less is known about the foundations of rural resentment at the micro level, particularly in terms of how resentment can be mitigated. To address this gap, we examine three key questions: (i) what subjective and objective factors contribute to rural resentment within a rural municipality, and (ii) can local participatory measures, such as a citizen council, reduce resentment, and if so, (iii) for which individuals?We answer these questions using data from a real-world experiment in a German rural municipality, where a local citizen council deliberates on the future of a community-owned building. We analyze whether rural resentment varies within this rural place based on subjective attachment and objective peripherality and deprivation. In addition, we examine whether contact with the local citizen council reduces resentment and identify heterogeneous effects conditional on place attachment and contact intensity. We argue that by involvement in the citizen council, individuals in rural municipalities feel heard and better taken care of by authorities. This research offers new insights into the social underpinnings of rural resentment and the potential for local participatory measures to mitigate such tensions.","Keywords: rural resentment, citizen council, experimental study","Anne-Kathrin Stroppe, Antonia May","Anne-Kathrin Stroppe","GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences"," Antonia May","GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a randomized controlled trial, we test the effects of a training program to teach elected officials how to collect and evaluate evidence. The training program, developed in part by the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission, was offered to local elected officials in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Once registered, participants were randomly assigned either to the evidence-based policymaking training or a placebo training course. We find that the half day training course significantly improved statistical literacy, demand for evidence, and interest in partnering with academics. The training made participants think that finding academic partners was a more significant obstacle than they had thought.

"abstract_1388_2117_0491.html","Pre-registration and private experimentation","We develop a model to explain pre-registration, the practice of empirical researchers describing significant parts of their planned analyses prior to any data collection. To do so, we consider a model in which a Sender attempts to persuade a Receiver of the truth of some hypothesized state of the world. The Sender can sequentially learn the outcome of noisy experiments, each of which are informative about the state of the world. The Sender's information acquisition is private and the Receiver does not observe the outcome of an experiment unless the Sender chooses to reveal it. This creates an opportunity for `p-hacking' where Sender may perform a large number of tests and reveal only those with favorable outcomes. We augment this private experimentation game with a very weak form of pre-registration with no enforcement and no Sender commitment power. Specifically, the Sender sends cheap talk messages about her intended experimentation plan prior to observing the outcomes of any experiments. We show that the private experimentation game with no pre-registration possesses many equilibria with very different levels of p-hacking. However, when this problem is most severe, the Sender's expected payoff is higher under equilibria that at least somewhat limit her own ability to p-hack. Finally, provided that the Sender and Receiver share a common language for experimentation plans, pre-registration tends to select the Sender-optimal equilibrium from the underlying private experimentation game.","Keywords: experimentation, peer review, disclosure","Keith Schnakenberg","Keith Schnakenberg","Washington University in St Louis"," Jacob Montgomery","Washington University in St Louis"," Zion Little","Washington University in St Louis","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Washington University in St Louis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"abstract_1390_0506_0391.html","Financial Dependencies and Conflict Resolution: The Role of Militarized Mediators in Modern Insurgencies","In the complex landscape of modern conflicts, ""militarized mediators""—external actors who fund and mediate disputes—pose a critical paradox with significant implications for conflict dynamics. This article examines the impact of these dual-role actors on conflict outcomes across 31 African countries, with detailed case studies. Utilizing the UCDP External Support Dataset for monetary support to rebel groups and the African Peace Processes Database for mediation efforts, the study analyzes mediator-rebel dyads through cross-sectional time series data. Employing Fixed Effects Panel Linear Regression, the first part assesses whether external funding from militarized mediators enhances their negotiating leverage compared to traditional mediators. The second part uses Cox proportional hazard models to predict the durability of peace following their involvement in peace agreements. The findings suggest that financial dependencies imposed by external supporters can constrain rebel groups' strategic options, potentially leading to quicker conflict resolutions but less durable peace. The dual role of militarized mediators can introduce conflicting interests, hindering effective peace agreement implementation. This study contributes to the rebel finance literature by highlighting the strategic limitations imposed by external funding and enriches peacebuilding literature by examining how mediators' financial interests influence conflict resolution efforts. The research enhances our understanding of the relationship between funding mechanisms and mediation effectiveness, paving the way for new avenues in conflict management and peacebuilding strategies.","Keywords: Militarized Mediators, Rebel Financing, Conflict Mediation, External Support, Comparative Analysis, Conflict Resolution","Elisa D'Amico","Elisa D'Amico","University of St Andrews","Kasia Houghton","University of St Andrews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of St Andrews","University of St Andrews",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Against this backdrop, this paper examines the gender gap in attitudes toward AI, with a focus on how gender-based differences in risk-taking drive support for AI's adoption and regulation. Analyzing survey data from approximately 3,000 respondents across Canada and the United States, we show that women are more skeptical than men of AI's economic benefits, and more likely to emphasize its economic risks such as job displacement. Our analysis identifies two key drivers behind this gender gap: women's higher levels of general risk aversion and higher exposure to AI-related risks. To establish a causal relationship between risk and AI attitudes, we further show experimentally that as the perceived benefits of AI become more uncertain, women's support for companies adopting AI falls more sharply than men's, and their support for government intervention against AI increases. Considering technology's capacity to reinforce gender inequalities, we conclude that AI policies and regulations that fail to incorporate women's perspectives risk perpetuating these disparities in the workplace and society.","Keywords: automation and AI; gender gap; public opinion; political economy","Sophie Borwein","Sophie Borwein","University of British Columbia","Beatrice Magistro","California Institute of Technology","R.

"abstract_1392_2509_0701.html","Strategic Voting and Utilitarian Outcomes: Insights from a Novel Simulation","This study investigates the relationship between voting rules and utilitarian outcomes, providing a comprehensive analysis of strategic voting dynamics. Under a utilitarian framework, the optimal choice maximizes total expected voter utility. Voters may express preferences sincerely—based on direct utility—or strategically—considering both utility and the likelihood of a choice winning.Employing a novel computer simulation, this research systematically evaluates multiple majoritarian voting rules against the utilitarian criterion across varied electoral scenarios. In addition to examining the established form of strategic voting (that we call Type A), where voters support their second-preferred option to improve its chances of winning when their first preference has low prospects, the study introduces an additional dimension: Type B strategic voting. This alternative perspective examines scenarios in which voters manipulate their ballots to increase the probability of their most preferred option's success.The findings illuminate critical trade-offs between strategic voting and utilitarian efficiency. Under plurality voting, Type A strategic behavior enhances utilitarian efficiency by up to 20%, aligning electoral outcomes more closely with aggregate voter utility. In contrast, Type B strategic voting, especially in systems like the Borda count, greatly increases strategic behavior—sometimes doubling it—exacerbating deviations from utilitarian choice.By expanding the analytical scope of strategic voting, this study deepens our understanding of how voting rules influence voter behavior and collective outcomes. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on electoral system design, underscoring the complex interplay between sincerity, strategic behavior, and utilitarian efficiency.","Keywords: Strategic-Voting, Utilitarian-Efficiency, Voting-Rules, Electoral-Systems, Computer-Simulation","Ram Hardy","Ram Hardy","Tel Aviv University"," Yael Shomer","Tel Aviv University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Tel Aviv University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several studies have examined the effect of social media and the internet on electoral outcomes. However, there has been limited research on how access to broadband internet affects the electoral penalty following well-known corruption cases. This study aims to investigate the role of internet access in the electoral success of one of the two largest political parties in Spain, the Popular Party (PP), after the trials of the corruption scandal known as the Gürtel case in 2016. To establish the causal effect of broadband internet access on the PP vote, I apply a difference-in-differences methodology, leveraging the exogenous expansion of broadband internet access between 2013 and 2019 across Spanish municipalities. Additionally,  data on municipal-level corruption is incorporated to explore the drivers of this effect. The main findings show that municipalities that gained internet access significantly punished the PP, and this effect was notably stronger in municipalities with perceived corruption cases in previous years. These results underscore the importance of Internet access in shaping voter decisions and the electoral penalty for corruption scandals.","Keywords: Internet access, Electoral penalty, Corruption cases, Municipal corruption","Alejandro de la Fuente-Cuesta","Alejandro de la Fuente-Cuesta",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of BarcelonaBarcelona Supercomputing Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While all weapons exporters face this tradeoff, they differ in how they weigh strategic interests against the economic gains to be had from arms sales, with “vultures” putting relatively more weight on economic gains and “hawks” putting relatively more weight on strategic considerations. We document variation in the position of arms suppliers along this tradeoff using data on the international arms trade from 1950 to 2020 leveraging, among others, an important network feature: countries that supply to both parties of a conflict. We then devise a theoretical model that sheds lights on a series of mechanisms that may explain the observed variation, including economies of scope, commitment devices against time-inconsistent preferences, and strategic costs. We finally illustrate these mechanisms through a comparative case study of French and US arms trade policy.","Keywords: formal theory, conflict, trade","Romain Ferrali","Romain Ferrali","Aix-Marseille School of Economics","John Londregan","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aix-Marseille School of Economics","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Delegation composition at UN climate negotiations","This paper examines the often-overlooked role of delegation composition in climate negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While prior research has emphasized delegation size as an indicator of negotiation capacity, we argue that size alone fails to capture the complexity of national presence at these talks. Our extensive original database covers all individual participants in UN climate change negotiations, including all COPs and Bonn Subsidiary Meetings (SB). Our analysis covers 58 meetings between COP1 in 1995 and SB58 in 2024. The database allows us to trace participants over time and to identify their role in a country’s delegation. Based on this rich individual-level data, we create several dependent variables to create a holistic view of delegation composition, including the level of experience of the most senior negotiators, the share of external experts from NGOs and the private sector, the amount of government bureaucrats represented in the delegation, as well as the size of the supporting entourage. Theoretically, we build upon institutionalism, two-level games theory, and multi-level environmental governance to explain country delegations’ composition. Empirically, we use multilevel regression analysis of delegations clustered in countries and in years, with country-level and meeting-level covariates. Our paper shifts focus from delegation size to the qualitative aspects of participation in multilateral negotiations, offering a more nuanced understanding of countries' capacity to participate meaningfully in global climate policy.","Keywords: multilateral negotiations, climate change, national delegations, UN negotiations","Silvana Tarlea, Paula Castro","Silvana Tarlea","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","Paula Castro","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","Axel Michaelowa","University of Zürich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zürich University of Applied Sciences","University of Zürich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We seek to answer this question by looking at the case of Italy, a peculiar sociopolitical context in which the levels of LGBTIQ+ equality are still amongst the lowest in Western Europe, notwithstanding the rising politicisation of LGBTIQ+ issues in recent years. We employ original survey data devised to provide novel evidence concerning the attitudes of Italians on several LGBTIQ+ issues that are salient in the public debate, and their determinants. Leveraging a representative sample of the voting-age Italian population, we assess the impact of sociodemographic, attitudinal, and party-political predictors on a wide range of issues pertaining to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) and trans* and non-binary (TGNB) citizens. These include same-sex marriage, same-sex adoptions, rainbow families, simplified administrative procedures to change IDs for TGNB people, and the possibility for TGNB students to change their names in school and university registries. Descriptively, our data show an absolute majority of Italians in favour of greater LGBTIQ+ equality, although the distribution of attitudes varies across different issues, and the rights of TGNB people are generally more contentious. Further, our multivariate analyses show that pro- (anti-)LGBTIQ+ attitudes are primarily a function of left-wing (right-wing) political ideology, being a woman (man), secularism (versus being a catholic, especially if practising) and, in line with contact theory, having LGBTIQ+ relatives or friends. Instead, contrary to widespread expectations, LGBTIQ+ attitudes do not seem to be a matter of class or education in contemporary Italy.","Keywords: LGBTIQ+ politics, public opinion, survey data, rights, Italy","Federico Trastulli","Massimo Prearo","University of Verona"," Federico Trastulli","University of Verona","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Verona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A survey experiment in Spain and Germany","How do political identities shape preferences for social solidarity? Political theorists such as Miller and Walzer argue that political identities influence individuals’ willingness to share risks and resources with fellow members of the political community. However, to date, there has been no empirical investigation into the validity of this argument within the context of the European Union. To address this puzzle, this paper analyzes whether core normative conceptions of European identity related to the economic, political and cultural understandings of the union, influence citizens’ preferences for solidaristic policies at the supranational level. The empirical strategy is based on a survey experiment conducted in Spain and Germany in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Furthermore, to verify the generalizability of the experiment, we analyze a cross-sectional representative survey conducted in 2016 across thirteen European countries. The paper finds that different normative framings of EU identity influence citizens’ attitudes towards solidarity policies within the European Union. Specifically, in the case of support for member states facing financial crises, the influence of EU community framing appears to be less significant. In contrast, our findings indicate that perceiving the EU as a cultural union increases support for EU unemployment benefits.","Keywords: EU solidarity, Framing of EU, European identity, EU redistribution, EU social policy","Zsófia Ignácz","Zsófia Ignácz","Goethe University Frankfurt","Irina Ciornei","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Goethe University Frankfurt","Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The prevailing assumption is that objective economic conditions act as information cues, shaping citizens' subjective perceptions of local economic conditions.  However, subjective economic perceptions often diverge from objective indicators. In this article, we examine the objective-subjective nexus by investigating the factors influencing citizens’ perceptions of a place’s economic deprivation.

Analyzing five waves of pooled cross-sectional survey data from the British Election Study (2017-2022), linked to median house prices at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) and the Local Authority District (LAD) level as proxies for local and regional prosperity, our results reveal that while absolute local house prices strongly influence perceptions of a place’s economy, citizens also draw on relative comparisons. However, both spatially, comparing their locality to London, and temporally, assessing its local economic trajectory over time, effect strengths vary. These findings highlight the multidimensional nature of economic  evaluations, underscoring the interplay between objective economic conditions, subjective perceptions, and salient reference points.","Keywords: Political economy, political geography, spatial inequality, house prices, perceptions of inequality","Anne-Kathrin Stroppe","Jens Carstens","Sciences Po Paris","Anne-Kathrin Stroppe","GESIS / University of Mannheim","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sciences Po Paris","GESIS / University of Mannheim",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While scholars often point to strong property rights and EU-style courts, such constraints rarely emerge directly from judicial institutions in these settings. Without reliable accountability, foreign investors must continually assess whether conditions favor their entry. In this project, I built a model that highlights an underexplored informational function of the court system. Lawsuits can reveal broader risks of expropriation. Anticipating this, policymakers may strategically enact systematic judicial reforms or implement temporary measures to signal their commitment to protecting market interests. In the equilibrium, thorough reforms are most likely where the local economy’s export reliance is moderate and investors worry most about judicial expropriation. Moreover, while negative economic shocks prompt changes in the judicial system to attract FDI, only systematic reforms yield genuine quality improvements. Temporary interventions tend to be more superficial. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach and multiple datasets from China, the evidence shows that as trade losses increase, local judicial favoritism declines, reflecting rising demand for foreign business and the heightened value of court rulings as information. Judicial reforms are implemented most extensively in provinces moderately reliant on U.S. markets. Improved judicial quality only materializes in areas undergoing comprehensive reforms; mere temporary interventions do not suffice. Additionally, following trade shocks, judges are more likely to favor foreign plaintiffs, signaling a pro-market stance that supports the hypothesis: cases offering better informational value to foreign investors are more likely to result in impartial rulings.","Keywords: Authoritarian regimes, Judicial reform, Foreign direct investment, Persuasion, Trade shocks","Lingnan He","Lingnan He",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"the University of Chicago",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that these restrictions serve two goals of the government: (1) preventing technology diffusion to foreign rivals, and (2) strengthening the government’s control over domestic firms that are not effectively regulated by traditional policy tools. Ihypothesize that the government is more likely to intervene in foreign acquisitions of domestic firms when those firms control key technologies. Additionally, firms weakly regulated by the government should be more likely to engage in investment activities that necessitate national security-based restrictions. To test these hypotheses, I compile an original dataset of 1,054 national security reviews conducted by CFIUS, the inter-agency committee responsible for screening foreign investments in the US. I identify key technology owners through network analysis of 3 million patent transactions involving Chinese and US firms. The results indicate that, compared to non-innovative US firms, those controlling key technologies are 81.34% more likely to face CFIUS intervention when seeking foreign capital. Furthermore, US firms that are weakly regulated by the US government are 17.41% more likely to engage in M&A activities that trigger CFIUS reviews, compared to firms with high regulatory exposure. Firms’ central positions in innovation networks incentivize the government to restrict their access to foreign capital, challenging the conventional belief that powerful firms are better positioned to promote investment liberalization.","Keywords: Investment restrictions, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, FDI, national security, US-China relations","Sichen Li","Sichen Li",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1406_0379_0283.html","How do geopolitical interests affect financial markets reaction to international institution projects?","This research investigates the intricate dynamics between the catalytic and inhibitory effects of projects financed by international institutions and geopolitical interests. Thanks to the construction of a monthly dataset, we first examine the impact of the approval of a project financed by one out of five international institutions on the global macroeconomic situation on non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). In particular, we study the potential catalytic effect or inhibitory effect of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We underline the existence of a catalytic effect and an inhibitory effect in non-permanent members of the UNSC that can significantly impact national macroeconomic situations in a positive or negative way. Second, we contribute to the literature by emphasizing the importance of the country's geopolitical preferences in the existence and nature of the catalytic effect. We measure these geopolitical preferences through the distance between one country's ideal point in the United Nations General Assembly and the ideal points of UNSC permanent members session after session.","Keywords: International institutions, United Nations, Geopolitical preferences, Catalytic effect, Inhibitory effect","Hugo Oriola","Hugo Oriola","EconomiX, CNRS, Université Paris Nanterre","Jamel Saadaoui","IEE, LED, Université Paris","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EconomiX, CNRS, Université Paris Nanterre","IEE, LED, Université Paris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1407_1609_1059.html","Trans lives matter? Determinants of support for transgender rights in Spain","In February 2023 the ‘Trans Law’ was passed in Spain. This law generated considerable controversy. It was opposed not only by the radical right and the centre-right, but also by some socialdemocratic sectors linked to traditional feminism, who accused it of allowing the ‘erasure of women’. The feminist movement was divided and the positioning on this issue did not seem to reproduce a purely left/right logic. This cultural war seemed to be yet another example of the polarisation in this country, albeit along different group lines. We used original data from the III and IV National Polarization Survey to demonstrate which variables explain support for this law. Specifically, we seek to corroborate whether ideology was not a key explanatory factor (given that certain left-wing sectors opposed it) and whether women showed a more sceptical attitude towards this issue, breaking their greater tendency to show support for progressive policy proposals. Finally, we analyse to what extent partisan biases were reproduced in this case and how other socio-demographic variables played a role. The results show that support for the Trans Law clearly reproduced the left/right divide, that women supported this law more than men (there is no majority cultural backlash against it on their part) and that, although it was the alternative left that was most enthusiastic about trans rights, social democratic voters were also supportive. In short, trans rights reproduce divisions already present on other issues and have not generated new lines of rupture in Spain.","Keywords: transgender; partisan bias; cultural backlash; feminism","José Miguel Rojo-Martínez","José Miguel Rojo-Martínez","University of Murcia"," Claudia Mayordomo-Zapata","University of Murcia"," Alejandro Soler-Contreras","University of Murcia","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Murcia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1408_1415_1471.html","State-Centric Persistence: Evaluating and Pursuing Social Welfare Benefits in Middle-Income Democracies","Lower and middle-income democracies today promise substantial social welfare benefits to their citizens, and yet actual access remains quite variable. Access to these social programs is rarely automatic and instead often requires sustained efforts by eligible individuals. In these contexts, what do potential beneficiaries believe about the state’s likelihood of delivering these benefits? Further, why do some potential beneficiaries persist in their pursuit of welfare benefits after facing obstacles to access, while others do not? In this paper, we draw on original focus groups in Brazil and Argentina to argue that three attitudes – entitlement, indignation, and self-efficacy – decrease the psychological costs of interacting with the state and affect citizens’ behavior in the pursuit of social programs. We then use original surveys to develop novel measures of entitlement, indignation, and self-efficacy in the domain of social policy. We provide evidence that these attitudes strongly correlate with state-centric persistence above and beyond their relationship with other actions. We also explore the extent to which these patterns vary with partisanship across the two country cases. Finally, we explore the origins of these attitudes and show that an individual’s knowledge of social rights correlates more strongly with entitlement, indignation, and self-efficacy than sociodemographic characteristics or measures of other behaviors.","Keywords: social welfare, administrative burden, public opinion, comparative political behavior, Latin America","Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro, Matthew S.

"abstract_1409_0996_1475.html","Emerged, reversed or frozen? Urban-rural divides in political support in Europe, 1973-2017","There is near-consensus in the existing literature that people in rural areas lack support for their existing political systems. Research has pointed to higher rates of populist voting, protests like the Gilets Jaunes and, especially, to survey evidence on lower political trust and satisfaction with democracy in rural areas. However, the latter is based exclusively on data from recent periods and, even then, from only a few survey projects, giving only a partial impression of where, when and to what extent rural-urban divides in political support have developed. Using harmonised data from the Survey Data Recycling Project (1973-2017), we test for urban-rural patterns of institutional trust and satisfaction with democracy (SWD). We posit three competing possibilities: urban-rural divides have either ‘emerged’ (i.e. no divide existed historically, but now rural areas have lower support), ‘reversed’ (i.e. rural areas were historically more supportive, and now they are less so), or ‘frozen’ (i.e. rural areas were historically less supportive, and still are). Results suggest clear support for ‘reversal’, as rural areas exhibit higher political support in the 1970s/1980s and lower political support by the 2000s/2010s. The next steps will attempt to account for the emergence of this rural deficit in political support, testing theories related to economic disadvantage, cultural change and the relative political power of ruralites and urbanites.","Keywords: Rural-urban divide, European politics, polarization, harmonized data, public opinion","Lawrence Mckay","Lawrence Mckay","University of Southampton"," Viktor Valgarðsson","University of Southampton"," Will Jennings","University of Southampton","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Southampton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1410_0284_1545.html","PR1125: Public Commenting and Accountability","Public Commenting and AccountabilityAbstract: Public participation in local policymaking is often dominated by small groups of residents who are unrepresentative of the larger population. Why do politicians grease the squeaky wheel? One possibility is these members of the public, who tend to be highly informed and engaged, are some of the few voters able to hold their politicians electorally accountable. We investigate this possibility by recontacting commenters at public meetings, testing whether commenters meet the conditions necessary for accountability. First, we show how often commenters make explicit threats of withholding support to politicians. Second, we measure how often commenters recall their past positions on projects, the resulting policy action, whether the policy action aligned with their position. We further test whether opinions of incumbents and intention to vote in the upcoming election are related to whether policies were out of step with commenters' preferences.","Keywords: responsiveness, public meetings, accountability, land use, local politics","Alexander Sahn","Alexander Sahn","UNC Chapel Hill","Tyler Simko","Princeton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNC Chapel Hill","Princeton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1411_2360_0492.html","Measuring Pivotalness: How Coalition Probability Shapes Small Party Fortunes","One of the biggest questions in political science is how small interest groups can achieve their policy goals and get representation against the “tyranny of the majority.” In this paper we argue that within multiparty (parliamentary and presidential) systems pivotal parties can get more political positions, and more policy benefits beyond their sizes. We define pivotalness by creating a new probabilistic theory of coalition formation. We argue that the probability that a given coalition forms is never zero, and the probability can vary based on the cost-benefit calculations of the parties. We weigh coalition probability between different parties after an election by their sizes and the compatibility of their preferred policy demands. We make a distinction between programmatic and distributive demands and in case of the programmatic demands the compatibility of the issue preferences. Then we calculate new coalition probability-weighted versions of established power measures like the Shapley-value and the Banzhalf-index. We test our theory with data from multiparty industrial democracies in Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America. We calculate the pivotalness factor of each party that achieved legislative representation in these systems. We find that parties that have higher weighted power indices enter into coalitions more often and when they do they get ministerial positions in proportion to their pivotalness factor.","Keywords: coalition governments, multiparty politics, policy representation, party power indices","Zsuzsanna Magyar","Zsuzsanna Magyar","Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI)"," Marika Csapo","Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI)","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1412_1937_0390.html","Interstate Polarization and Civil War Intensity: The Role of Intervening States' Foreign Policy Misalignment in Determining Conflict Severity","While interstate relations are frequently appealed to explain why states intervene in civil wars, their influence on the dynamics and trajectories of these conflicts remains insufficiently studied. Rather than simply assuming the relations between opposing interveners, or between the conflict country and rebel-supporting states as being hostile, I argue that these relationships are more nuanced and accordingly exert varying effects on civil war trajectories. Specifically, I hypothesize that greater misalignment in the foreign policy positions of the involved states intensifies civil wars by increasing battle-related fatalities. This occurs as external sponsors are incentivized to escalate their support for their preferred side, driving more decisive military engagements. To test this hypothesis, I make use of dynamic national ideal points derived from individual states’ voting behavior in the United Nations General Assembly. These ideal points allow me to estimate a continuous measure of the distance between states’ foreign policy positions. Using a Quasi-Poisson regression model, I analyze all conflict dyads between 1989 and 2017 that experienced either opposed or rebel-sided interventions. The results partially support the hypothesis: greater misalignment in the foreign policy preferences of opposing interveners significantly increases conflict intensity, while the relationship between the conflict country and the rebel-supporting sponsor does not produce statistically significant effects. These findings underscore the importance of the international system in shaping civil war dynamics, independent of the conflict-affected state itself. They demonstrate that polarized interstate relations amplify conflict intensity, irrespective of the foreign policy alignment of the civil war country.","Keywords: Third-party Intervention, Civil War Intensity, Foreign Policy, Interstate Polarization","Cuichi Miess","Cuichi Miess",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"LMU Munich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1413_1172_0089.html","The Determinants and Consequences of Technological Job Insecurity (Panel: TECHPER)","The labor market implications of rapid technological change are vast and uncertain, and so are its political consequences. A potential way to capture the highly dynamic impact of technological change is to rely on perceptions of technology-related job insecurity. However, in order for these perceptions to exert explanatory power, we need to have a thorough understanding of what explains their formation. Thus, after establishing an empirical connection between technological job insecurity and political preferences based on original data from the US, this paper asks the following question: What are the determinants of subjectively perceived employment risks from technological change? Drawing on two original survey sources and using Bayesian Item Response Theory modeling, we show that exposure to modern technologies in the workplace is a strong predictor of subjective risk. In contrast to the view that individuals with high skills and cognitively demanding job tasks are less vulnerable, we find that perceived employment risks increase with the work-related use of complex technologies like programming languages.","Keywords: Technological job insecurity risk, political preferences","Tobias Tober","Tobias Tober","University of Konstanz","Valentina González-Rostani","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Konstanz","Princeton University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1414_1521_1571.html","Mechanism Design Goes to Nuclear War","Crises in the nuclear era are commonly framed as contests in ""brinkmanship,"" where actors compete by raising the background risk of a nuclear exchange until one side lacks the resolve to continue and backs down. But this framing may be too reductive: in practice, actors deploy a range of coercive capabilities that both alter the risk of escalation and shape political outcomes. How do these limited coercive capabilities shape outcomes in nuclear crises? We analyze the brinkmanship framework, finding broadly that more resolved actors will take greater escalation risks and perform better in conflict. We also analyze a ``contests of capabilities'' framework, showing that when a state’s resolve also shapes its willingness to compete at lower levels, more resolved actors may engage in less risky or less decisive measures. We use a game-free methodology to study how the underlying military fundamentals affect crisis behavior in settings with autonomous escalation risk across a wide variety of bargaining games.","Keywords: Game theory, mechanism design, political economy, international relations, nuclear deterrence","Peter Schram","Peter Schram","Vanderbilt University"," Brenton Kenkel","Vanderbilt University","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Vanderbilt University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1415_2582_1584.html","Signalling the Private Sector: Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Regulation","The establishment of anti-money laundering (AML) regimes, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), has long been justified as a necessary measure to crack down on illicit financial flows. While these regimes have achieved relatively high levels of compliance, their actual impact on altering patterns of money laundering remains largely debated. Given the high costs of compliance and the uncertain payoffs, an important question arises: why do countries choose to join these regimes?  This paper argues that compliance with AML regulations is not primarily intended as a direct mechanism to curtail illicit activities but rather as a signal to private investors about the stability and credibility of a state's financial market. I examine this trend of compliance in the recent context of shifts away from the Western-dominated financial structure. Using a between-within random effects model, I examine the relationship between AML membership and foreign investment flows of varying maturities. The initial findings suggest that states prioritize AML compliance to attract foreign investment, even when the regulatory costs to their markets are significant.","Keywords: anti-money laundering, financial flows, regulatory regimes","Carly Potz-Nielsen","Carly Potz-Nielsen",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"Georgia Institute of Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"abstract_1416_2067_1055.html","We Didn’t Start the Fire: Homophobic Populism and the Fight for LGBTIQ+ Equality Under Authoritarian Rule","Crackdowns on LGBTIQ+ communities across the MENA region are on the rise, although the catalysts for such a wave of queerphobic repression are insufficiently theorized and understood. Extant research posits that anti-LGBTIQ+ repression in the region is predomenantly driven by authoritarian states seeking to legitimize their authority. Scholars have argued that anti-LGBTIQ+ repression reflects strategic calculations on the part of autocrats, distracting from policy failures in times of crisis, and promoting their rule as an effective safeguard against the imposition of foreign social norms. Such theories often fall short from explaining variation in how autocratic states have approached LGBTIQ+ rights activism and do not square with the reality on the ground. In this article, I argue that backlash against LGBTIQ+ rights unfolds somewhat similarly in democracies and autocracies alike. Drawing on case studies and original qualitative data from Lebanon, Palestine, and Tunisia, this article traces the spread of queerphobic populism and its global diffusion positing that this phenomenon underlies much of what we conceptualize as anti-LGBTIQ+ backlash, and explains the latter as the joint production of both state and non-state actors. The article, in turn, tackles the varying methods, temporal aspects, and motivating factors behind anti-LGBTQ+ repression in the region and explores the importance of factors exogenous to incumbent regime. It also aims to bring into sharper focus how LGBTQ+ collectives negotiate their visibility within the confines of repressive political regimes and hostile publics.","Keywords: LGBTIQ+ rights, activism, authoritarianism, strategic repression, populism, homophobia, diffusion.","Samer Anabtawi","Samer Anabtawi",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University College London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The scarcity of research addressing this question, as well as the shadow of self-selection looming over most of it, calls for more research on the relationship between inter-class contact and political attitudes. I contribute to this field by examining an unexplored institution in the existing literature: compulsory military service. A diff-in-diff approach, focusing on Spanish cohorts close to the removal of conscription and with females as the control group, reveals that males born in conscripted cohorts are significantly more likely to support redistribution. I present placebo tests discarding that these findings merely reflect a differing trend between genders in a broader set of political attitudes. Furthermore, I rule out plausible alternative explanations as well as present two manipulation checks indicating that the removal of conscription did indeed reduce inter-class contact among males.","Keywords: comparative political economy; inter-class contact; support for redistribution","Fernando Sánchez Monforte","Fernando Sánchez Monforte",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"",NA,"University of Oxford, Nuffield College",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
